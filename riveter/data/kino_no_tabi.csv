0,v1c1,1,1,"Across a meadow ran a single motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly).
There, nothing could be seen but the moderately wet earth, the grass across which winter was slowly beginning to spread, the sky and the clouds, and the sun. There were no mountains in the distance, and grass circled around from all sides. Ninety percent of one’s vision would be occupied by the sky.
The motorrad was packed full of travel luggage. On top of the rear pipe carrier sat a large briefcase, above which several containers of water and fuel were lined up. As if cutting through it, on each side of the rear wheel was a box. A rolled-up sleeping bag was tied to the headlight.
“This is so boring…,” said the motorrad.
“That’s the one hundred eighty-fourth time,” the rider said.
“……”
“……”
And then they both fell silent.
The rider wore a brown coat, the excess hem of which was rolled up to her thighs. She wore a brimmed hat with long flaps that covered her ears, as well as a pair of goggles. The face behind those goggles was young; the girl seemed to be in her teens. She had large eyes, and wore an intrepid expression across her face.
There wasn’t anything like a path along the grassy field, so while running across the grass, avoiding the occasional bump, the motorrad casually continued along.
Eventually, the sun rose so high that the motorrad’s shadow extended completely horizontal to it.
“Are we taking a break anytime soon, Kino?” the motorrad asked.
“Well,” the rider named Kino spoke. “Not yet. But maybe we can stop early today, and take it easy this evening.”
“Got it… but even so, this is boring,” said the motorrad.
“One hundred eighty-fifth time,” said Kino. Then she asked with a carefree tone, “I thought about asking you this yesterday. Do you get bored even when we’re moving?”
The motorrad called Hermes replied, “That’s right, especially when it’s like this, where the land is all flat and we’re going at the same speed, it’s as if I’m on a factory roller, and it feels as though only my wheels are moving. Or rather, I feel like a mouse inside a cage.”
“I see….”
“What about you, Kino? Just like this, when the scenery doesn’t change a bit, doesn’t it get tiring?” Hermes asked.
Kino answered, “Whether it’s tiring or not, I think about other things while riding, so that notion passed me by a long time ago.”
“Eh? What kinds of things? Tell me a bit about it,” Hermes requested. Kino said that it will probably be uninteresting, but Hermes pressed on.
“Just now I was thinking, if I were having a knife thrust at me from the right, and I hit the attacker’s hand to drop his weapon, do I make a shoulder throw, or do I twist his hand back and pin it down? Or, should I take one step back and kick his hand? Or is it better to dodge the thrust with half of my body while going for an elbow strike?”
“……”
“Those sorts of things.”
“… That’s not interesting.”
“I told you.”
The motorrad continued to run across the meadow.
“So boring…,” Hermes sighed.
“One hundred eighty-six…”
Kino stopped in the middle of her utterance. She stood up while riding. ‘What’s wrong?’ asked Hermes.
“What a surprise…”
“Hmm?”
At first, from their location, Kino and Hermes could see things that seemed like specks of trash. When they advanced further, there were several black dots in the green space below the horizon. They gradually came closer and realized that some of the dots were big while others were tiny.
Before long, they found something else. The larger things were dome-shaped tents, several of which were constructed close together. The smaller things around them were groups of livestock, and the people next to them.
Hermes whistled, “That is surprising indeed. There are people here. And cows and horses and sheep. And houses too.”
“This isn’t a country, is it…? They’re nomads…”
“There are actually people living here. That’s amazing.”
Kino slowed Hermes down a little. A person on a horse turned to Kino and rode over to them. It was a young man in his prime wearing peculiarly-made clothing.
“What do you think, Kino?” Hermes asked.
“If they don’t welcome us, we’ll take a detour. I’ll talk to him first.”
Kino stopped Hermes. The man came over. He wasn’t carrying anything. With a smile, he said, “Hello, traveler. We are a clan living in these meadows.”
Kino returned the greeting. The man asked Kino where she was headed.
“A country to the west. I have no intention to get in the way of your lifestyle. I’m just passing through.”
Thereupon, the man shook his head.
“There’s no need for that, and that’s not what we want. For generations, it has been our tradition to welcome the travelers we occasionally meet. We’ll share with you our food and dwellings. By all means, please become our guest. I came as a representative of our leader.”
“I see…” Kino muttered. Kino asked Hermes what to do.
“I don’t mind as long as you’re fine with it.”
After pondering for a moment, Kino spoke to the man, “I understand. Please excuse me for the intrusion.”
With a truly happy expression on his face, he exclaimed, “Then please follow me!”
He rode his horse towards the settlement. Kino launched Hermes and slowly approached. 


In the settlement, there stood approximately twenty portable tents. Heavy cloth covered the large, dome-shaped objects. One huge tent stood out from the rest.
An uncountable number of cows and sheep casually chewed on grass in the area near the settlement. Men riding on horses were shepherding the flocks around.
A group of about twenty people awaited Kino and Hermes. Various ages were apparent in the group, from young people under twenty to middle-aged women. About half of them have pipes stuffed in their mouths, from which smoke came out.
Before the group, Kino cut Hermes’engine and got off. Then she removed her hat and goggles.
“Hello, everyone. My name is Kino, and this here is my partner, Hermes.”
“Hello there.”
The oldest-looking man among the crowd, who had a pipe in his mouth with smoke rising from it, spoke, “Mister Kino, Mister Hermes. Welcome. I am the chief of this family. Since we are constantly relocating, it is rare for us to meet a traveler. Please do relax and rest your tired body with us.”
After Kino thanked him, a kind-looking middle-aged woman led her to one of the tents. Along the way, children could be seen peeking out timidly from several tents.
The tent’s interior was so spacious that it seemed like several people could sleep inside it at once. Wooden frames radiating outward from a central wooden pillar supported the roof. Soft felt was laid out underfoot.
The entrance was made larger for Hermes so he could enter. When Kino heard that this tent normally served as the woman’s house, but will be made into her personal quarters for a while, she voiced her thanks once more.
After the woman left, Kino removed her coat. Kino was wearing a black jacket underneath, with a belt strapped around her waist. Attached on the belt were several pouches, and on her right thigh hung a revolver-type hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case a pistol). Behind her hung another weapon, a .22 caliber automatic. Kino called the revolver ‘Canon’ and the other ‘Woodsman’.
Removing Woodsman from its holster, Kino toppled over, face up, inside the tent.
“This is comfortable,” she muttered instinctively.
“It is,” agreed Hermes. “If you think about it, this tent seems like it would be warm in the winter and cool during summer. See, the hems are open. It must be so that it could be put together and taken down quickly.”
“In order to search for pasture, they must have to relocate plenty of times every year. The chances of us meeting them like this may be miraculous. Have they been living in this meadow, existing side by side with earth and nature their whole lives? And with no high protective wall surrounding them…” Kino said this with profound emotion.
“Are you jealous? I bet they’ll be your friends if you ask.”
Kino got up and spoke, “No, I’ll pass. I doubt I’d fit in either.”
“Well, where would you fit in?” Hermes asked.
“Is that something,” Kino started, “I should look for?”


In the evening, Kino was invited to supper.
Since Hermes was asleep, Kino left him in the tent and was introduced to everyone in front of the large tent which belonged to the chief. The entire clan consisted of a little less than fifty people. There were about ten children who were no more than twelve years old. 
After that, she was treated to a meal in the chief’s tent. Lined up on a low and long table was a simple and frugal meal primarily made from dairy products. When Kino was asked if the food suited her tastes, she honestly replied that it was delicious.
However, because of the incessant smoking of their pipes, the inside of the tent was considerably filled with smoke. Kino’s eyes began to sting, and she asked for permission to leave. She went outside in search of fresh air.
Outside the tent, while she was looking at the burning dusk sky, someone suddenly spoke from her side.
“You are…”
Kino, startled, turned toward the voice’s origin. Before her eyes, with the completely red sky set as the background, a man who appeared to be in his thirties stood. He had well-ordered features, and it may have been because he seemed so emotionless.
Kino’s expression changed slightly when she saw the man.
Though he was wearing the same clothes as the rest, his eyes were of a different color – a light shade of gray. The color of his skin was also somewhat different, and he was noticeably taller than the others.
“Don’t mind me,” he said to Kino, who was looking at him dubiously. He continued to stare fixedly at her with his gray eyes and asked with a flat tone, “Are you the traveler who came today?”
“That’s right,” Kino nodded.
“Everyone thinks that you’re a man. You’re not, are you?”
“……. What about it?” Kino returned.
“Nothing,” the man said without changing his expression.
He looked at Kino for a while longer, and then left without going into the tent.


The next day.
Kino woke up at dawn as usual. The weather was good.
When she went outside, everyone was already awake and milling about with their daily activities. A woman was milking the sheep. A young fellow was grooming a horse. There were children helping to light a fire. Occasionally, an adult would come over to the fire to light his pipe.
When a woman who happened to pass by told Kino that it’s fine if she sleeps a little longer, she replied that she was accustomed to waking up early.
The woman who had spoken to her smiled and said, “That is a very good thing.”
Back inside her tent, Kino practiced drawing Canon and Woodsman. After giving them a quick tune-up, she returned them to their holsters.
After everyone had finished their tasks, they gathered in small groups in various places and began their breakfast. The meal consisted of what seemed like bread and a topping of melted cheese. Kino said that it was very delicious, and then offered them some of the clay-like portable rations she had for them to try. To this, they made a complex expression, and ended up only eating a little bit of what she gave them.


After the meal, the men mounted their horses and left to shepherd the animals. The women who were left were in charge of cleaning up, mending clothes or the tents, and looking after the children. They occasionally took a break and smoked their pipes under the blue sky.
While she was examining Hermes, Kino noticed that the children were looking on from afar.
“If you want a closer look, go ahead. He doesn’t bite,” said Kino.
“How rude! … But yeah, that’s right.”
The children approached timidly. The youngest among them were mere toddlers, while the oldest were about eleven or twelve years old. Since it was rare for them to see something like Hermes, some of them touched him with deep interest.
“Whoa, it’s stiff!”
“Amazing… it’s an iron horse.”
“His name is Hermes,” so Kino said, and immediately, cries arose from the children.
“What a weird name!”
“How strange!”
“That’s a funny name!”
“Hurr-meez?” one of them asked.
“No, no! It’s Hermes. Not ‘hur’, but ‘her’.  It sounds weird when you say it like that!”[1]
“Hurmeeees!”
“I told you it’s not ‘hur’! ‘Her-mes’!”
While the innocent children and the shameless Hermes let loose on each other, Kino noticed that a few of the children had small pipes in their mouths. Looking closer, she saw that there was no grass in them.
“What are those pipes? Do you all smoke too?” Kino asked the oldest-looking boy.
“Nah, we just have them around. Only the adults can smoke them. Because the adults work for the sake of everyone, they get to smoke as a reward. When we’re recognized as adults, we get to smoke for the first time.”
“Uh-huh.”
“In order to be recognized as an adult, the boys have to ride horses. But not only do we have to ride them, we also need to be able to order around the flocks of animals, too.”
“What about you?” Kino asked.
“I’m still in training…,” the boy replied in a small voice. He then pulled out a sickle from behind his waist and said, “B-but! If it’s harvesting grass, I’m the best! If my mom helps, yeah, it’s the best…”
The boy said this proudly, but a girl behind him who looked about twelve said,
“Harvesting the grass is the women’s work. A boy who can’t ride a horse is pretty uncool.”
“……”
The boy fell silent. The girl turned to Kino and said,
“I’m going to bear his children. He’s going to be my husband.”
“Huh…? It’s already decided?” Kino asked.
“Yup. From the time I was born. That’s why he has to become cool. But he’s no good as he is right now,” the girl said energetically as she gave a big nod.
“Pfft, whatever. You’re just a tomboy,” the boy sourly responded.
The girl ignored him and continued, “It’s quite sad, actually. I’m better at horse-riding than him.”
Kino made a wry smile.
“If that’s the case, then can’t you guys just exchange jobs once you’re living together?”
The girl stared blankly at her for a moment, and then,
“Oh. You’re right. I’ll ride the horses when I grow up!”
“You can’t do that. That’s so dumb.”
“It’s fine! I’ve already decided. I’ll go tell my father now.”
“You can’t.”
“Can too!”
Kino followed the pair with her eyes as they chased each other in high spirits. When she turned around, Hermes was still chatting with the kids surrounding him.
“I! Told! You! It’s not ‘hur’, it’s ‘her’!”


At noon, the men returned, and everyone had their lunch and afternoon naps.
After that, Kino was invited to try riding a horse. The clansmen instructed Kino, who had never ridden a horse before.
At the beginning, she was only making slow strides, but when she became used to it, she became able to ride at a fairly high speed.
Kino’s brilliant riding skill was watched upon closely by the adults with admiration. The chief, with the smoking pipe in his mouth, curtly said,
“It’s decided.”
The adults surrounding the chief nodded in silence. From a place slightly farther away, a horseman watched this scene with his gray eyes.


Evening. It was after the usual meal in the smoky tent.
In front of her own tent, Kino, who was sitting on Hermes who was set on his center stand, looked up at the sky. Clouds were gathering over the western horizon, and the sunset was darkish. 
“So, did they ever end up getting your name right, Hermes?”
“No… All those children still think that you told them ‘Hurmees’.”
Kino stifled a laugh. “… You know, when we leave tomorrow, you won’t have another chance to correct them.”
“I suppose so…” Hermes muttered, and continued, “It looks like the weather will be bad tomorrow, Kino.”
“You’re right….  Even so, we can only stay for three days.”
“… Roger,” said Hermes. Kino got off Hermes. Right then,
“You…”
“Whoa!”
The ashen-eyed man from the previous night had suddenly spoken up from behind. Hermes let out a yelp while Kino turned around to him with a glare.
The man took a few steps toward them. The man stood beside them and looked down on Kino and Hermes.
He asked, “Where are you from?”
Kino, without breaking her gaze on the man, shook her head.
The man asked again, “Have you decided on a country where you will be staying permanently?”
Kino spoke slowly, “I’m still… going to travel for a long time.”
The man made several small nods. He continued with his accent-free voice, “I see. You’re able to accustom yourself to that destitution you call freedom? That’s quite something.”
“……”
“What’s wrong?” the man asked Kino, who was silently staring at him.
And then Kino asked, “This may be rude, but… were you a traveler before?”
“No,” the man replied immediately.
“That’s a lie, isn’t it?”
“Yes. It’s a lie,” the man replied immediately again. As if seeking confirmation, Kino slowly asked,
“You… you weren’t born with these people, were you?”
“……. What about it?” the man responded and turned on his heels.
Kino followed his back with her eyes. When he could no longer be seen, Hermes asked,
“He’s sharp. Just who in the world is he?”
Kino responded truthfully.
“I don’t know…”


The next day, that is, the morning of the third day since Kino encountered the clan.
The sky was covered with low, heavy clouds. Though the sun had risen, the dimness of the sky hasn’t changed.
After breakfast, Kino informed the chief of her intention to leave that day. With a surprised face, he asked if they had done something that displeased her.
“No. It’s only because I have decided to stay for only three days in any single country…. I’m enormously grateful for your hospitality.”
The chief, taken by surprise for a moment, immediately said,
“The truth is, we already planned a welcoming celebration for you, and we will be holding our first dinner party in a long time tonight. We will be choosing a cow to be slaughtered for everyone to eat, so everybody’s looking forward to it. Besides, the weather is bad, so can’t you stay for one night longer?”
“…….  I really thank you for taking that much trouble, but…”
Upon seeing Kino’s hesitation, the woman who had lent Kino her tent spoke,
“Chief, we can start the preparations immediately. If we do that, then we’ll be able to hold the party a little past noon. That way, Miss Kino could take part as well.”
“Ooh, how about that?” the chief asked. Kino nodded in assent.
The chief really looked pleased and alerted everyone to the plan.


“—— and because of that, we will be leaving after the feast,” she told Hermes while piling her luggage on him.
“Okay. Have fun.”
After she had finished her preparations for departure, Kino left Hermes in the tent, put on her jacket and turned toward the chief’s tent.
The sky was still covered, and there was very little light.


“Well, this is boring…”
Soon after Kino left, Hermes complained by himself in the tent.
Right then, the hem on the opposite side of the entrance was raised soundlessly. A man’s shadow slipped inside.
“Who’s there? Kino’s not here right now.”
“Yeah,” returned a voice, its owner approaching.
“Oh, it’s just the mister with the gray eyes…” Hermes said somewhat nervously. The man grabbed Hermes’ handlebars, removed him from his stand, and pushed him forward.
“Well, let’s go.”
“Where to?” Hermes asked.
“To put it one way,” the man replied, “Hell.”


In the chief's tent, several long tables had been lined up, with about thirty people in all sitting around them. As usual, everyone was inseparable from their pipes, and the inside of the tent was awash with the stench of burning weed. At the center was a chunk of well-roasted beef.
Kino was offered a seat near the center of the tent, and with that, the party began. The man in charge cut up the meat into sections with a large kitchen knife. Salt and dried garlic was spread adequately across the cuts.
When Kino asked where the children and the rest of the family were, the man next to him responded,
“We couldn’t fit everyone in this tent, so they’re in a different one. Besides, there are those who have to guard the animals and look after the children. They’re taking turns doing it, you see. It’s been a long time since we’ve had meat after all. Also, it’s our custom to not let the children participate. They must be frustrated right now, and wanting to become adults sooner.”
The man whiffed a puff of smoke from his pipe and took a sip of liquid from a flask fashioned out of intestines. He offered Kino some, but when she learned that it was alcohol made from sheep’s milk, she politely declined.
“Miss traveler, how about some of this?” A woman passed a wooden cup to Kino. It had tea in it.
Kino thanked her and accepted it. Kino sniffed the tea, and then asked, “It has an interesting aroma. What kind of tea is this?”
“Huh? Um, uh… well, you see, it doesn’t have a name…,” the woman was taken slightly aback, but gave a smile and continued, “Well, go ahead and have a taste.”
Kino stared at the tea for a few moments. And then,
“I think this tea might be a bit too intense for me. I apologize, but I’ll have to decline.”
She placed the cup on the table.
The man next to Kino looked at her suspiciously.
Kino slowly stood up. “Everyone, I am very grateful for this feast, but it’s about time for me to leave.”
Every member of the family simultaneously looked at her with an astonished expression.
“Is that so? Well then, let me escort you outside,” said the woman who offered her the cup of tea.
She then led Kino toward the exit. Kino slowly turned her back, and suddenly twisted her body around.
The woman brought down a club, missing the back of Kino’s head and sweeping her shoulder. Kino took a leap backwards. She kicked up the table behind her, scattering some of the food.
Everyone in the tent stood up at once. With clubs in their hands, they looked at Kino with stiff expressions. The young men blocked the only exit, and the rest surrounded Kino.
“What’s the meaning of this?” Kino asked.
The chief spoke from behind, “Miss Kino. Won’t you please just keep quiet and drink that tea? We don’t want to give you a painful experience. We won’t take your life; you just have to endure for a while.”
Kino slowly turned around and questioned the chief.
“What if I refuse?”
Without answering, the chief waved his hand lightly. The sound of clubs being gripped tightly was heard.
Kino slowly pulled Canon out of the holster in her right thigh.
Everyone faltered for a moment, but soon the chief took one step closer to Kino.
“Hoho! Are you planning to use that? However, you can’t keep on firing that forever, can you? You may be able to bring down a few people, but after that, it’s over!”
“Yes, you’re absolutely right,” Kino said, and slowly returned Canon to its holster.
Several men approached Kino. Then Kino trampled violently on the end of the table by her feet.
As the men flinched from the table that flew up, Kino moved to the opposite side of the exit. She pulled out the kitchen knife still stuck in the meat and seized the nearest person ——the chief. She grasped his hair from behind with her left hand and poked his throat with the kitchen knife with her right.
“Nobody move!” Kino cried sharply. Everyone’s movements came to a complete halt.
“Y-you bastard…,” the chief who was forced to face upward said in anguish.
“I won’t take your life; you just have to endure for a while,” Kino said bit by bit.
“Hah! It’s futile. There’s no way you’ll get out of here. Your motorrad must have been destroyed by now.”
“Then it’s like that time…,” Kino whispered absentmindedly. At the same time, she grabbed the chief’s hair more fiercely, pushing the knife’s blade against his throat.
Amidst his distress, the chief shouted,
“… Everyone! Even if I die, don’t let her leave the tent! Don’t let her take a single step outside!”
“How admirable.”
Kino tossed away the knife and let go of the chief at the same time. Before the knife fell, she pulled out Canon and fired three shots in succession.
A thunderous roar echoed inside the tent. It was from the lower part of the central pillar. All three bullets hit that place, and the wood was hollowed out. While watching the men springing towards her, Kino gave the pole a violent kick, toppling it over.
The roof of the tent fell in a moment.
Kino crawled out from under the hem of the tent. Not a single soul could be seen under the dark sky; only the similar-looking tents lined up in silence.
When she looked back, she saw the adults wriggling under the flattened tent. Somebody cried out.
“Damn! Look for her! Chase her! Bring her back alive! Blood! Precious blood!”
Kino began to run to her own tent. However, when she passed through one side, a man who leaped out from there found her.
“You’re not going anywh——”
Kino shot the man’s foot. He tumbled over, shrieking in pain.
“There she is! Over there!”
Hearing someone’s voice from behind her, Kino clicked her tongue.
She took a roundabout path to conceal herself among the nearby tents. At that moment, her mouth was covered violently from behind her head.
“!”
Kino flailed at her right side, pushed Canon at the chin of the person behind her, and pulled the trigger.
No bullet came out. Kino’s face froze.
“Don’t say a word. I’m not going to hurt you.”
She heard an emotionless voice speak from behind her ear. The force restraining her mouth loosened, allowing her to turn her neck.
Ashen eyes stared back at her. His right hand gripped Canon, his thumb interposing the hammer. He slowly drew his hand away from Canon and released Kino.
“Don’t use your persuader. It’ll give out your location.”
Kino looked up at the man.
“Aren’t you going to attack me?”
“No, I won’t.”
Right when he said this, another man’s voice was heard.
“There she is! Rauher’s got her!”
Three men with clubs approached them.
“Use this. Leave two of them to me,” said the ashen-eyed man called Rauher.
He handed Kino a club similar to theirs.
The three men had rushed to them unprepared and became confused when they were attacked by Kino and Rauher.
While Kino knocked out one of the men, Rauher had beaten down the other two.
Rauher pulled a knife from his waist, and swiftly cut through their windpipes. They writhed as blood gushed out from their throats and soon died. He then did the same with the man Kino took on.
“Why? Why is it all right with you for me to escape?”
Rauher lightly shook his head.
“I’m doing this for their sake. They’ve been living in suffering for a long time.”
“What do you mean?”
“Come over here.”
Rauher forcefully pulled Kino to a nearby tent.
“This is my tent.”
Right when Kino entered,
“Kino! You’re safe!”
“Hermes?”
Kino raised her voice without thinking. Inside the tent was Hermes, propped up on his kickstand and piled with luggage.

“I convinced him to come with me earlier. If we’re in here, they won’t find us for a while,” Rauher said, putting a pipe in his mouth.
“Thanks for doing that. Things turned out just as you said, huh?”
“Yeah. It’s just that, it was too early for this to happen. As expected of you, Kino. On top of not drinking tea, you were also able to escape from the tent,” Rauher said as he lit his pipe. He was using a match from Kino’s luggage.
“I’m borrowing this,” he said shortly. Then he began to smoke; he seemed to find it relaxing.
“Can I question you?” Kino asked as she replaced Canon’s cylinder.
“Go ahead.”
“Why are they trying to attack me? Furthermore, why are you helping us?”
Rauher glanced at Kino.
“They have decided to take you in into the clan. As for the reason, it is to bring in new blood from the outside to this small tribe. They have been doing this for hundreds of years. They give passing travelers a warm welcome, and once they have appraised the person’s value to be high, they take them into the family. If a person’s value is low, he would be killed. They were really pleased with you. Do you get it so far?”
“Yes… but how? It didn’t look like they were bowing down and begging me, though.”
“With this.”
Rauher held out the pipe in his right hand before Kino’s eyes.
“You saw how all the adults were smoking this, right? There’s a strong poison in this grass. Smoke one once and it becomes a habit. It reaches a point where you can’t live without it. If you stop smoking for half a day, your head begins to hurt. Three days and your hands start trembling. Five days and you start seeing hallucinations. If you hold out for ten days, you die from madness, slobbering all over yourself. That tea you refused was laced with an extract of this grass.”
“If it’s as you say… what would happen if I drank it?”
“You would lose consciousness right there and then; you will be bedridden, moaning nonstop for days on end. During that time, Hermes would be taken apart and scattered under the ground, and the clan would relocate.”
“……”
“I don’t want to think about it,” said Hermes.
“You would be smoked even through your moans, so you’ll be perfectly addicted once you woke up. You won’t be able to live at all without this. The grass doesn’t grow anywhere other than this field, and the only time it can be harvested is during a short period in autumn. You can either spend your life doing your compulsory duties as part of the clan, or you can die of withdrawal symptoms. It’s your choice either way.”
“I see. I understand very well now.” Kino nodded several times. She then asked Rauher, “When did you…?”
“Five years ago. I was careless.”
“How… has it been?”
Rauher gave a bitter smile, and put some more grass into his pipe.
“Ah… When I first woke up, I wondered what on earth had happened. I spat curses out, and to make things worse, the negative response from the poison was gut-wrenching. I began to familiarize myself with death. I thought for sure I was going to die.”
Rauher lit his pipe and put it back in his mouth, which had curled into a smile.
“But, the woman who was attending to me, well, she was more of a young girl back then, but anyways, she said this to me: ‘It’s no good if you die. You can’t die!’ She said this to me again and again through a sea of tears, ‘If you live, good things will surely happen!’ Heh. That’s right.”
“……”
“And so I chose to live here. I memorized my duties quickly, and I was accepted by everyone. And then… I became married to that woman. Well, it was actually decided the moment I had been ‘evaluated’, though.”
“Were you happy?” Hermes asked.
“You could say that, I guess,” he said. “That was, perhaps, the happiest time of my life.”
“What happened to your wife…?” Kino asked.
“Last year, around this time, she was killed,” Rauher responded with a voice devoid of emotion.
“Why was that?”
Rauher breathed a puff of smoke. Voices could be heard outside the tent.
“She’s not in here either!” someone shouted as they passed by.
“It’s because she couldn’t bear children,” Rauher answered the question.
“?”
“She bore my child, but it was miscarried. She became unable to bear another child for the rest of her life. If a woman could not produce children, she has no value. Such people are a waste of precious food and grass, a waste that they could not tolerate. Not here. Kino… don’t glare at me like that.”
“… Excuse me.”
“So it was immediately decided, at the order of the chief, that she had to die. She accepted that, was killed, and then buried. As to where, I no longer know.”
“What were you doing all that time, mister?” Hermes asked. Rauher took another huff of smoke.
“In the end, I told her the same exact thing she first said to me.”
“……”
“……”
“And that’s how it is.”
Rauher took one last puff of smoke, tossed the ashes, and put away the pipe. And then he muttered,
“It’s about time, I think.”
“What?” Kino asked.
Rauher didn’t answer and moved silently to the side of the tent’s entrance.
A clansman poked his head into the tent and saw Kino.
“There she is! She’s here after all!” the man yelled, and in the next moment, great splashes of blood spewed forth from his throat.
Rauher went over to the man’s corpse and kicked it outside.
“Well, let’s go outside… it will be all right.”
Rauher opened the entrance wide. Kino unfastened Hermes’ kickstand, and slowly pushed him along.
Outside, all of the adults had the tent surrounded. When they saw Kino and Rauher step outside the tent, a commotion spread across the crowd. The sky was darker than it had previously been. Hermes muttered, wondering if it would rain.
“What’s going on here?” the chief asked while glaring at them.
“There’s nothing to be said about it. I seem to have simply gone off and done as I wanted, Chief.”
“Hand over the traveler. I’ll consider your punishment later.”
Rauher pulled out his pipe, then leisurely and carefully stuffed it with grass.
“Don’t bother. Your time is over.”
“Nonsense!” the irritated chief shouted. He issued orders to a few men holding long rods. “Attack all at once! Don’t let them escape! I don’t care if you have to give them a few injuries!”
Rauher struck a match. He slowly transferred the flame to his pipe——
Bam—!
A muffled explosion echoed in the settlement. The adults whirled around, and a pained scream emanated from the one who found its origin.
“F…Fire! The grass tent is burning!”
“What?!”
From a single tent, copious amounts of smoke were rising out of a hole in the roof.
“I told you. If you don’t do something fast, everything is going to burn up,” Rauher said while taking a smoke.
Everyone’s faces became pale. They rushed toward the burning tent, as if they have completely forgotten about Kino and Rauher.
The smoke from the tent began to rise with increased vigor, and flames could be seen flickering from inside.
“The grass! The grass!”
“The grass of life!”
“Put out the fire! Put it out somehow!”
Rauher, Kino, and Hermes watched on from behind as the people screamed madly.
They hit the fire with their clubs and whacked it with their clothes, but their desperate attempts to put out the fire were entirely ineffective. The fire, unrestrained, grew more furious.
“That was the tent where all the grass that they’ve saved from last year was stored. I rigged it earlier. I asked Hermes if I could use a little bit of oil and gunpowder. ——Without that grass, everyone’s got ten days left to live,” said Rauher. Kino turned to face him. 
“Including me.” 
Rauher breathed a puff of smoke.
The fire grew more and more, and the flames shined on the figures of the people surrounding it.
One man moved closer to the fire, resolving to salvage some grass. The sleeves of his clothes and his hair caught fire, and soon, his whole body was lapped up in flames.
The man danced, engulfed by fire, screaming an otherworldly scream all the while. No one helped him, and he eventually danced his last and fell down. There were several more people whose bodies caught fire.
The faces of numerous people desperately trying to put out the fire turned a ghastly pale as they collapsed from suffocation. 
As people were tossed out of the way or stepped upon, the futile fire-dousing operation continued.
The roof of the tent fell. As the flames engulfed the entirety of the grass, the smoke grew more tempestuous. White smoke signals flared upward.
Kino gazed at the depressing situation before her as she watched person after person collapse. Others desperately breathed in all the smoke they could, thrusting their faces deep into the fumes. White foam began to appear from their mouths as they staggered, making strange shrieks before fainting.
Finally, the tent and the grass had burned down entirely. Around the burned wreckage, the motionless bodies of several people tumbled about.
The people who could still move ended themselves.
Suddenly, a man grabbed the neck of a nearby woman and pinned her to the ground, choking her to death. Then, he began to bludgeon to death the people cowering around him. As the sound of heads splitting open could be heard, the number of motionless people increased. There were also people who burned as they set themselves on fire.
One man tottered towards Kino. Both of his hands had been turned into charcoal.
“Heheheh…”
The man laughed, and then closed his hollowed eyes. Rauher slashed at his throat in a moment.
And then, Rauher moved closer to the charred ruin, putting the others out of their misery: the people who sank down the floor, those who were weeping, laughing, or embracing each other, those with foams coming out of their mouths, those who were bludgeoned to death, and those who were burned halfway through.
He impassively stabbed his knife into their necks. Slowly, the number of the living decreased.
“Y-you… what are you…”
The last remaining person, the one once called the chief, spoke to Rauher, who was standing before his eyes.
“One year ago, if you hadn’t done that, maybe there would have been another way…”
The man with the bloodstained knife looked back at him with his ashen eyes.
The chief held his head in his hands and muttered as he tore at his hair.
“Ooh… it’s the end… it’s the end of everything…”
Rauher shook his head sideways.
“No.  Not everything. Goodbye, father.”


With the knife remaining in the neck of the chief, Rauher turned around. Kino and Hermes looked on as he came over to them.
“Hell has ended. You can go now.”
“Let’s go together. Gather up as much of the remaining grass from everybody’s pockets, and go to some country nearby. Maybe somehow, the poison will be released from you. If you’re just going to die by staying here, why don’t you try what little possibility there is?”
The man looked at Kino and muttered, “Maybe that’s what would be good….” Then, he clearly said, “But I’m staying here.”
“Why? … There’s nobody here anymore,” Kino said.
Rauher smiled.
“Have you forgotten?”
“?”
“The children.”
“Oh!”
“Not everything has ended.”
“……”
“I’ll explain to them what the adults did, what they were smoking, and why I did this. Also, I’ll teach them how they could live on their own until I die of madness. Yes, I have to show them that death as well. If I can do that, they should be able to use the remaining animals and survive. They should be able to make a new future, one without smoke. That’s why I’m… staying here.”
“… I understand,” Kino gave a small nod. And then she asked, “Where are you from? If it’s a place I pass by…”
Rauher shook his head.
“There’s no need for that, and it’s better if you don’t do something like that. In the country I was born in, I was a murderer.”
“……”
“What did you do? Since this is the end, tell us.” 
Hermes said this with emphasis on ‘since this is the end’. Rauher gave a sad smile.
“The end, huh…? I was a soldier then. Ever since I was a little kid, I received special training. When war came, I assassinated lots of enemies. I thought I had killed for the country’s sake, for everyone’s sake. But, after the war, I became a nuisance. For a country that has won a fight in the name of justice, it couldn’t be said publicly that an assassin took lives in its place. As a broken-down, murderous demon whose usefulness had expired, I was expelled from the country. I didn’t want to go on a journey or anything like that. I wanted to spend my whole life in the place I was born in. I wanted to build my family and live a normal life there. When I came upon these people, I wondered if I could start from scratch.”
“… I see. Thank you so much,” said Hermes.
“Don’t mention it,” replied Rauher.
Kino remained silent, putting on her coat, pulling her hat and goggles on. As she was about to start Hermes’ engine,
“You look a lot like her,” Rauher said suddenly.
“Huh?”
“You asked me why I helped you earlier, right? I still haven’t answered you. It’s because you reminded me so much of her. No, not your face, but your eyes… Your eyes are so much like hers. They’re exactly the same.”
Rauher slowly narrowed his ashen eyes.
“Your… wife?” Kino asked. Rauher nodded.
“Yes. Even now, it’s like a dream.”
“……. By any chance, if I was taken into the family, would I have been made your wife?”
“That’s right.”
“……”
“This is goodbye. I was really glad that I met you.” Saying this, Rauher turned his back to Kino.
“I won’t ever forget that you saved me for the rest of my life… goodbye,” Kino said to the man walking away from her.
The man didn’t turn around; he simply, lightly, waved his hand.


The sound of a motorrad’s engine echoed throughout the settlement, and then it was gone.
The children were shuddering in one tent. Finally, the entrance opened, and an ashen-eyed man entered. He told them that he had something to tell them. He said that it was something very important, something he wanted all of them to hear.
The children slowly gathered around the man in a circle. The man surveyed each of the children. He opened his mouth, but in that instant, a sickle was stabbed into his throat, and not a sound came out of it.
‘I saw you! You’re the enemy of everyone!’ someone said. The man tried to say something, desperately moving his mouth, but no voice came out, and he finally died.
The children went outside of the tent. And then they cried. When they grew tired of crying, someone spoke up.
‘From now on, we have to live on our own.’
Everyone nodded.
‘From now on, we have to do everything that the adults did.’ 
Everyone nodded.
In the tent of the chief, the children searched for anything useful. Someone found a bag with lots of ‘strange things’ in it, and everyone looked.
It was grass. Nobody recognized it, but it was the grass that the chief had stored up for use in times of emergency. There was a considerable quantity of grass.
Someone realized that this must be what all the adults were smoking, and suggested that they try smoking it.
‘That’s only for the adults!’ someone scolded. But then, someone said,
“We are now the adults. And so, these are our rewards.”
This view became accepted, and every one of them put a pipe in their mouth and began to smoke. At first, it gave some of them an awful sensation and found it sickening, but in order to become adults, they endured.


Half a month later, this family——

















"
1,v1c2,1,2,"It was three in the morning.
I finished my work at last. As always, I tidied up my manuscripts. As always, I put them inside an envelope. And as always, I stowed it inside the lowermost right drawer of my desk. It will be kept that way until my editor comes to pick it up.
I stood up from my chair and slowly stretched as I walked towards the center of the room.  I stretched from tip to toe, as if I was trying to make myself taller.
After I made a sound like that of a kitten stuck beneath his four siblings, I felt my strength being sucked out. The fatigue which I have forgotten as I wrote in my desk for ten hours straight suddenly came over my whole body.
I love this feeling of exhaustion.
The way I sank into my bed felt different, as if I were very heavy. If I let myself sink completely, I can let a number of hours pass by without thinking about anything.
If I didn’t let myself sink deep enough, my body would feel as if it were floating, and my head would spin. My mind would inevitably be overrun with various thoughts.
My job right now. My plans for the future. If my thoughts stop with that then it’s fine, but if I inadvertently come up with a new story, then it’s no use. I will not be able to sleep for a while.
In that case, I will be lying on top of my bed in a strained posture, and if I don’t commit into writing the things struggling inside my head one after the other in the notebook always by my side, they might disappear. Once I have finished everything, the sun would have completely risen. My exhausted brain felt admiration to whoever said the words, ‘Writers work throughout the day.’
I felt like I have the right to be lazy after completely finishing a story which has taken me so much time. I flopped onto my bed.
Thud! My body rebounded, and slowly but surely, began to sink. My whole body felt heavy, and I don’t want to move anymore.  Even so, I moved my hand very slightly to remove my long hair which was blocking my breathing. It’s still a bit too early for me to succumb to an eternal sleep.
That’s right. I’ll go and have my hair cut tomorrow. My hair has grown so much after being neglected for some time.
I suddenly remembered my teens; the time when I still had hair too short for a girl.
A time when I still held a pistol and lived amidst gun smoke.
And I remembered the day when it all suddenly came to an end.
That cheeky motorrad Hermes, I wonder where he is and what he is doing right now?
I wonder what he would say if he sees me right now, completely settled down in one country, and as a popular female author?
That’s right. I’ll go and have my hair cut tomorrow.
I can’t make it as short as that time, but—— tomorrow, I’ll go and have my hair cut.
Having decided that much, I finally sank into slumber.


A single motorrad (Note: a two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) stood on top of the sand.
It was a sandy beach mottled with a rocky area. Various sizes of islands were scattered across the open sea.  The waves were calm. The spring sun soaring above the clear sky leisurely warmed the earth.
Away from the shores, the pine trees growing on the sandy beach increased in number. Soon the clump of pine trees became a beautiful, lush grove.
The motorrad was parked midway between the shore and the growths of pine trees.
It was packed full of traveling luggage. There was a box on each side of its rear wheel which was topped by a big bag and a rolled-up sleeping bag.  A small wooden board was fastened at the bottom of its protruding side stand so that it would not sink into the sand.
A lone human lay in hiding on the left side of the motorrad facing the sea. It was a young person, around mid-teens. Her blond hair was trimmed short like that of a soldier, and she had beautiful emerald-green eyes.
The jacket and pants she was wearing were full of patches all over, and thick rubber-soled sandals were tightly bound on her legs. She was gripping an automatic hand persuader (Note: A hand persuader is a gun. In this case a pistol).  This persuader was installed with something like a rifle’s stock, which can be positioned against the shoulders and cheeks when aiming.
With a tensed expression, the human spied with great caution towards the grove before her.
“Hey, I don’t know who you are, but I think it’s a good idea if you stop,” the motorrad said, but the human did not answer. She kept her persuader positioned and her eyes gleaming, trying not to miss anything that moved.
“Well, people may have their own circumstances, but to attack Kino, of all people…,” the motorrad spoke again.
“Shut up!”
The human replied harshly, and then, with a tone somewhat softer but still with a hint of nervousness, asked the motorrad,
“So it’s Kino, huh? The name of that traveler.”
“That’s right. And the one you’re using in place of a shield is Hermes,” the motorrad called Hermes said, and continued with a voice devoid of any tension, “Anyway, it’s nice to meet you.”
“Ah. I’m Inid… hey, that doesn’t matter!” the human called Inid yelled.
“Inid, eh? Nice to meet you,” Hermes greeted.
Ignoring this, Inid raised her body a little and peeked from the side of the sleeping bag. With her persuader steady on her shoulder, she aimed towards the woods, and fired. Three dry explosive sounds were heard in succession, and three empty cartridges fell on the sand. It was an automatic persuader which fires three rounds with one pull of the trigger.
“Tsk!”
As Inid clicked her tongue, Hermes asked, “You missed?”
“Shut up!”
“With skills like that, you will be the one to get shot instead.”
Inid laughed scornfully. “That’s what you’re here for – a shield. If your wheels get shot by mistake, that traveler won’t be able to continue traveling, right?”
“I suppose so…. But it’s Kino we’re talking about here, so…”
The moment Hermes said this, the sound of something cutting through the air was heard. Part of the sleeping bag burst open, and the feathers that it contained fluttered in the air. The bullet passed just above the ear of Inid as she tried to peek again. Her blond hair was showered with white feathers.
“… I’m sure she would fire without a second thought, just as you’ve seen.”
“……”
Inid’s face stiffened, and took refuge behind Hermes’ engine.
“If you don’t do something soon, Inid…”
“D-don’t say my name as if we’re close!” Inid cried out while lowering her head as much as she could, and swore under her breath.
“Why attack a traveler anyway? Just so you know, Kino’s not rich.”
“It doesn’t matter.  What’s important is that I get to attack and steal from someone.”
“What’s that about?”
Without answering, Inid swiftly raised her head, and while chasing something moving inside the forest with her gaze, fired several times in a row. Three rapid-fired rounds, five times.  Fifteen loud shots echoed in the beach.
After firing, Inid quickly lay down, dropped the empty magazine, pulled a fresh one out of her breast pocket and slapped it into the persuader.
“Damn! He escaped into the woods!”
“You missed again? You’re pretty bad at this…,” Hermes said frankly.
“I told you to shut up!” Inid retorted angrily.
“Well, calm down. Nothing good comes from being impatient in a fight.”
“I-I don’t want to be told off by someone like you…. But I suppose you’re right….”
Inid took a big breath and lightly shook her head.
“Well, why are you attacking travelers again?” Hermes asked, and Inid replied immediately,
“To be recognized as a member.”
“Of what?”
Inid remained prostrate, and while keeping the persuader’s sight aligned with her gaze,
“Pirates. The pirates controlling this area have a custom. There is a test for anyone who wants to become a pirate, to be given on their fifteenth birthday. On that day, you have to attack the first person you caught sight of, and steal their belongings. Kill if you have to. If you can’t do this, you can never become a pirate your whole life.”
“Oh, I see. But what if your opponent is abnormally strong? What if they fight back?”
“That will have to depend on your luck….  Luck is also important for a pirate. That is also being tested here.”
“Oh, I see,” Hermes said with admiration.
“As for me, today is that day. I will bring down that traveler and be acknowledged.  I will follow my father’s footsteps, and become captain someday. And so… I can’t let my boat sink with just the first row!” Inid said furiously with a stern face.
“Hmm… you’re quite desperate.”
“So be it. I’ve lived for this day…. I will win no matter who my opponent is!”
Inid tightened her grip on her persuader. With her emerald-green eyes, she glared into the woods through the gap between Hermes’ engine and frame.
“Now, come out. You’ve been making me wait forever…,” muttered Inid.
After three seconds, something red disturbed Inid’s left eye. She turned away her face in confusion. A single red dot of light 	now lingered on the top of her shoulder, at the place where her eyes had been earlier. The laser sight cut through the tiny gap between the engine and the frame.
“!”
Inid quickly moved her body away from this gap. At the same time, a shot rang in the forest.
The bullet did not hit Hermes. Neither did it hit Inid. It hit the wooden board propped beneath Hermes’ stand, and sent it flying.
“Whoa!” Hermes cried out. His stand sank into the sand, and he began to collapse on his left side.
“Ah!” Inid twisted her body to avoid the bag and the sleeping bag which suddenly started to fall towards her face. She eluded a direct hit on her head from these objects, but in exchange, she was pinned underneath Hermes. Face up, both legs under the engine, and her right hand beneath the luggage, together with the persuader.
“How mean…,” the collapsed Hermes mumbled.
“Ugh!”
Inid frantically tried to crawl her way out, but her left hand only dug out sand. She pushed at Hermes, but he barely moved.
“Damn! You’re so heavy! Get off me, you!” Inid shouted.
“Don’t make me do the impossible,” Hermes said.
While looking at the sky, Inid put all of her strength into pushing Hermes off. Somehow he budged a little, and when she thought she could finally free her left leg from under the engine,
“!”
The sky became dark. Someone was looking down at Inid. She couldn’t see this person’s face because of the sunlit background, but this person’s right hand was aiming a high-caliber revolver towards her. The red light which should have been aimed at Inid was pointing towards her knees.
“Damn… you tricked me…. You had two guns…,” Inid muttered feebly, her face blank with astonishment.
The person slightly raised her face. It was also a young person in her mid-teens, with short, unkempt, black hair, and wearing a black jacket.
“Are you okay, Hermes?”
“I’m fine, but I’m not sure about your sleeping bag. What about you, Kino?” Hermes asked in return. The person called Kino answered, her aim still trained towards the person trapped underneath Hermes.
“I suppose so.”
“That’s great. Well, hurry and raise me up.”
“Before that…”
Kino slowly dropped her glance and stared back at the emerald-green eyes trained at her.
“Hmph! If you’re going to shoot, do it quick!” Inid spat.
“Kino, let me introduce you.”
Hermes explained Inid’s circumstances in plain and simple terms.
“I see. So that’s why you suddenly attacked us. A test to be acknowledged, eh…,” Kino said. Hermes, who was still on the ground, effected an air of importance,
“Yup. A ‘right-of-way’, so to speak.”
“……. Um, ‘rite of passage’?”
“Yeah, that’s it,” Hermes said and fell silent.
“You’re getting worse lately, Hermes. That didn’t even sound the same,” Kino replied in amazement.
“… Really? Well, it’s fine as long as you get it. Languages are just like that.”
“But it takes me a long time before I get it. So——”
“Is that so? But in terms of improving your ability to recall things, my contribution is ——”
In the middle of the serious discussion Kino and Hermes were having,
“You guys!  Don’t ignore me!” Inid swore from below.
Kino returned the revolver in the holster in her right thigh. She picked up Inid’s persuader, removed the magazine, and disassembled it in no time. Then she tossed everything in a distance. She took out a string from the overturned bag and bound the hands and feet of Inid, who was gnashing her teeth in anger. Afterwards, she pulled out Inid free.
Kino raised Hermes and tried to somehow balance his stand using the fragments of the wooden board. In the meantime, Inid tried to pull on the ropes with her teeth to escape.
As Kino was finally able to prop Hermes up, Inid forcibly tore away the strings and charged towards Kino.
“Eat this!”
Kino quickly dodged Inid’s right straight, and at the same time, grabbed Inid’s collar with her right hand. Inid was thrown down to the ground face up. With her elbow, Kino brought down her entire body weight towards the pit of Inid’s stomach.
“Guh!”
Inid let out an unpleasant yelp and fainted in agony. Kino laid her sideways and bound her hands behind.
“Good grief…”
As Kino mumbled, Hermes teased, “She has guts. You should follow her example, Kino.”
After coughing up several times, Inid sat up. She then turned her face filthy with sand and tears towards Kino.
“Kill me! Kill me right now! If I can’t become a pirate, it’s better for me to die! Kill me! You can’t now, you chicken?!”
“You heard her, Kino. What are going to do?”
Kino glanced at Hermes, and then shook her head with a sullen look.
“Kill me! Are you going to leave it like this?! You bastard! Take responsibility and kill me!”
Still ignoring Inid, Kino went to the woods and retrieved her other persuader.  The automatic hand persuader was tied to a tree branch, a long string attached to the switch of the laser sight. Kino removed the string and put the persuader back in the holster behind her waist.
When she returned, Kino found Hermes chatting with the downcast Inid.
“––And so, like I’m saying, luck was not on your side this time. Luck, you hear? Luck.  You said it yourself, didn’t you? ‘That is being tested here, too.’ You don’t have to be that dejected; well I suppose you couldn’t help it. That’s all you’ve aimed for your whole life, after all, so I just can’t go about and tell you not to feel down. But that’s that, and you just have to accept it. It’s not like your whole life is over, and maybe in your future choices, luck will be on your side. Something good may be in store for you in the future——”
“Shut up…, shut up…” Inid would occasionally mutter in between sobs.
Hermes paid no heed and continued, “See, there are times when motorrads have to change riders. When that happens, the driving style and treatment sometimes change drastically, it becomes unbearable. But that’s like a motorrad’s fate, and there’s nothing we can do about it. Perhaps humans are the same too——”
As Kino sighed, she noticed a small ship appear from the shadow of an island. The ship headed towards their direction in full speed. She could see several silhouettes of men aboard the ship.
“That is…,” Kino said, and Hermes paused his consoling speech to say,
“Yup. They look like Inid’s mates.”
Kino nodded. “Just in time. Let’s escape?”
“Sure.”
Kino removed the hat and goggles inserted on her belt, and wore them. She straddled Hermes, and when she was about to start the engine,
“Traveler! Please wait! We have no intention of doing you any harm!” A loud voice echoed from the ship through a megaphone.
“It’s our law to make amends to those who got dragged into this rite and survive! Please wait!”
The voice and the ship approached.
“What are you going to do, Kino?” Hermes asked.
“Well, just to make sure…” 
As Kino tried to start Hermes’ engine,
“It’s a law…. Pirates are not supposed to lie…,” Inid, her head still hung down, said with a sigh.
“……”
Kino got off Hermes and unfastened Inid’s binds. Inid placed her hands before her, but remained seated weakly.
The ship ran aground the beach. All seven men aboard were shouldering persuaders, but none of them looked aggressive.
First, they surrounded Inid, crouched, and anxiously asked her if she was hurt. Inid did not look at their faces, and only shook her head.
A bearded, middle-aged man approached Kino and spoke, “Traveler, I am the captain. Just like I told you before, I want you to take these.”
The captain took a handful of gold and silver treasures from the bag hanging from his shoulder, and handed them to Kino.
Kino declined the offer, explaining that carrying things which originally belonged to other people might cause suspicion.
When the captain insisted to take responsibility, Kino asked him if he could share some fuel or ammunition.
The captain ordered one of the men to fetch some fuel cans from the ship. Kino filled Hermes tank until it was full.
“Thank you very much,” Kino said to the captain, who shook his head.
“I am the one who should be thanking you. It’s really frustrating that that child couldn’t become one of us, but it was thanks to you that she could go on living….” then he asked Kino, “After you tied her up, you could have killed her if you had so wanted. I believe someone of your skill will not hesitate to kill an enemy right before your eyes. And yet, you didn’t. Why is that?”
Kino looked at Inid who remained crouched on the ground, weeping. The filthy men around her were crying together with her. Kino looked at the captain’s face, and spoke.
“I don’t know.”
“I see…”
Then the captain, eyes blurred with tears, muttered,
“That child is lucky. Very lucky… Let’s just leave it at that.” 


Thus, on that day ten years ago, I wasn’t able to become a pirate. Thus, I came to live in a completely different world. It was the same, but at the same time, different world. The fact that I couldn’t stay in that world made my heart heavy.
I continued to cry as I listened to the motorrad leaving, as I boarded the ship, and until we reached our hideout.
Everyone was so kind. No one criticized me, laughed at me, or tried to hide their disappointment with smiles. I felt like killing anyone who would do so, but everything went well in the end.
Even so, I went to an uninhabited island on my own without asking permission. It was a small island without any food or water. I spent about fifty days there alone.
I did nothing but sit around the whole day in a daze. I thought that I might as well die from starvation.  I might have really died for real, if it were not for everyone stealthily placing food and water near me. I am truly grateful to everyone.
After that, I was taken in by a nearby country that secretly supported pirates, as required by law for those who fail the rite of passage. There I started to live a normal life. For the first time in my life, I went to school and studied.
Learning about new things became my diversion.
I finished school much earlier than I thought, and was hired in a publishing company much easier than I anticipated.
It was much more fun than I expected. I ignored books until then, but I became fond of reading them. In time, I found myself wanting to write them, and soon it became my job.
I would never know whether the work I have right now is more worthwhile than a pirate’s.
From time to time, when I see recurrent news or rumors about pirates, my whole body would give out a sense of yearning for that other world, of which I am no longer part of.
But even so… the current me, and not her[1], is who I am. And it will remain that way.


Ever since, I would check every single person who comes into the country; but no motorrad called Hermes, or a traveler called Kino ever appeared.
I would surely welcome them if ever they did come.


There’s no way they could have been attacked and killed by bandits somewhere, right?
Well, at least for them, such thing is not possible.
Now, I’ll go and have my hair cut.
I can’t make it as short as that time, but I’ll go and have my hair cut.















"
2,v1c3,1,3,"“Anyway, let’s see if we can ask the people around here, Kino.” 
“Yeah…. I suppose that’s the best way after all. ——Ah, umm… excuse me?”
“Yes? Oh, you guys aren’t from this country, are you?”
“That’s right. We are travelers. We just arrived in this country.”
“Then, welcome.”
“By the way, there’s something I would like to ask.”
“Sure, what would that be?”
“I’m looking for ×××××[2]. Is there one nearby?” 
“……? What did you say just now?”
“I was asking if there’s a ××××× around here.”
“Wait a minute. Are you making fun of people with that sort of job? What in the world are you trying to pull?!”
“Eh? No. I’m just looking for ×××××.”
“Ah! What a thing to say…. Hey traveler! If you insult these people any further, I will not forgive you!”
“……”
“Kino?”
“… Uh, if that’s the case, then let me rephrase it.”
“By all means! That’s what I want you to do!”
“Let’s see. Isn’t there a ××××× in this country? Or, is there a ××××× here? That is all I want to know.”
“… Truly, what a thing to say! You are such a terrible person! To say it in such a manner, do you not realize the pain you cause them? Wait, everyone come here! Everyone come!”
“Oh? What’s the matter?” “What?” “What’s with the loud voice?” “Why?” “What is it?”
“Listen everyone. Just now, this traveler said some outrageous things! She used ugly discriminatory words over and over again! Unforgivable!”
“You don’t have to shout just because of that…. Uh, is it you? Are you the traveler this lady here was talking with just now?”
“Yes, that’s right. But it seems like she finds my use of words offensive no matter what I do.”
“Hmm. It may be that this lady is just being too sensitive and melodramatic. Well, what is it that you want to know, miss traveler?”
“Umm, I just wanted to ask if there isn’t a ××××× here.”
“! W-w-what a thing… Miss traveler, please stop saying such things with a calm face. That is extreme mockery of a specific organization, of a profession!”
“That’s….  A ×××××, I’m looking for a ××××× that can do ×××××.”
“T-that’s enough! If you continue to spit out such careless remarks, we will take action against you!”
“Yeah!” “Cut it out!” “You scum!”
“Huh? Maybe no matter what I do, I will ×××××? What do you think, Hermes?”
“Kino. Perhaps, there’s no such thing as a ××××× here? That’s why they can’t conceive of the idea of ×××××. Whether you use ××××× or ×××××, it’s the same as ×××××?”
“Aack! Even the motorrad says mean things! They suit each other so well!”
“That’s right! You people are trash. You don’t deserve to live; your existence should be condemned! There’s something wrong with you!”
“Uh, there seems to be a misunderstanding somehow. To rephrase, I was just thinking of a ×××××. Isn’t there a ××××× with ×××××?”
“Eeek!” “What a thing to say!” “Didn’t I tell you? I was right!” “Hmph, there’s nothing we can do, this person’s rotten to the core!” “Don’t let the children hear!” “Boy, let’s go over there.”
“This is some trouble…. Hermes, do you know any good words to say?”
“How does ‘×××××’ sound to you?”
“What does ‘×××××’ mean?”
“Eeek—! Terrible! This is too much! You guys sure say such things so casually!”
“Hey damn brat! Stop using such abusive language! Stop this instant! Otherwise!”
“Otherwise?”
“……. Hmph! W-what’s that? Are you planning to threaten me with that hand persuader on your hip? Hah! Did you think I would stab you here? Give me a break! I wouldn’t do such a thing! It was only by chance that this knife fell from my pocket, and I was just returning it! Don’t jump to conclusions. You don’t believe a person now? You sad excuse for a human! You a*****e!”
“My goodness! You were thinking of using violence to have your way? You’re the worst!”
“That’s right. With that sort of attitude, it’s likely that up to now, she has killed a lot of people just because they don’t agree with her. She thinks nothing of shooting people. This person is a cold-blooded killer!”
“Yeah. If we just keep quiet and listen, she’ll say whatever she wants…. Words used without caution are weapons that can hurt people. What a foolish, defective creature.” 
“Let’s understand her pain. Let’s go beyond our anger and feel compassion towards this person’s prejudiced ideas. I’m sure her parents were trash, and did not teach her what’s right from wrong. Or maybe they were very poor and did not have the time for that. The father must be an alcoholic, and the mother must have run off to become somebody else’s mistress.”
“I see…. Well, I sort of understand what everyone is trying to say. My ××××× is ×××××, I suppose.”
“Kino, whichever way you say it, isn’t that ×××××?”
“You son of a b***h! To say that again! Leave this moment! Get out of this country! Get out of our sight! We can’t allow prejudiced people like you to stay in this country for even one more second! We would like to tear you to pieces for the sake of the poor people you have insulted, but since we’re generous, we’ll forgive you if you leave! Accept the mercy of these rational people, and get out of here! Everyone! Let’s expel these b******s with our combined forces!”
“That’s right! Get out! Get out of here!” “Trash!” “Murderer! Sadist!” “Get out!”
“This brat! Eat this——”
“That would be troublesome. Please stop.”
“… W-what are you glaring at? … I-I was just trying to pick up a stone which fell by my feet! Because it might be dangerous if a child trips on it! D-don’t get the wrong idea! You crazy b***h!”
“That’s right! This man is a kind person! I know that all too well! But it will take someone so skillful in spitting out words and actions that hurt people like you a whole lifetime to understand that!”
“Leave! Leave at once! If you want to die, die outside the country! And then become food for the maggots! This country is too good for prejudiced and violent people like you to breathe in!”
“Yeah, yeah! Do not pollute our country! Do not enter our beautiful country! You disgusting f***k!”
“When I see this person’s behavior, I remember a ruthless dictator from long ago who ordered the massacre of tens of thousands of people for the sake of his twisted ideology…. It makes me shiver. I’m sure this person is his reincarnation.”
“That’s right…. Hey traveler. Get out of this country right now. And know that words can become weapons. But don’t come near this country ever again. Do not infect us with your disgusting disease.”
“Yeah, get out.” “Get out!” “Beat it!” “Leave!” “Please leave now!” “Disappear!”
“… Oh dear. Well, it can’t be helped. Please excuse us. Take care, everyone. As for ×××××, maybe it’s better to ×××××.”
“Eeek——!” “You had to say that just when you’re about to leave!” “Get out! Get lost!”
“Get lost! Get lost!”
“Well then. ——Let’s go Hermes.”
“Bye-bye everyone!”


“——Phew. At last they’re gone. Those guys were hopeless.”
“Yeah. It’s so sad to see that people like that still exist. But they were outsiders after all.”
“That’s right. In our country, there are no such prejudiced people. We can only recognize the good attributes of things. We take everything in a positive light.”
“Anyway, what were the immigration inspectors doing? Why did they let that crazy traveler get an entry permit? Shouldn’t a person like that be sent to the hospital instead?”
“Indeed.”
“That’s true. People only come occasionally, so they should at least do their work properly.”
“Well, asking for an intelligent immigration inspector is too much. There’s no helping their stupidity.”
“Yeah. No one supervises their work, and even though discrimination is such an unforgivable thing, only the immigration inspectors think differently. It can’t be helped because they were failures since birth.”
“There are so many of them that we can’t count them with our fingers, right?”
“Ah, I’ve also heard about that.”
“So stupid.”
“Even so, these trash live long. Did you know? Their life expectancy is twice as much as that of an average person.”
“That’s amazing. I didn’t know. How come?”
“Well, that’s probably because they don’t use their heads. And so they don’t age. Having a long life is not necessarily a good thing, though.”
“True, true.” “You can say that again.”
“After all, the inspectors dared live outside the walls, in such a barbaric environment. I’ve heard before that those guys come into the country only once a month, when they receive their salary and go shopping. The rest of the time they spend outside the walls…. I wonder what they do with their families?”
“Well, they’re barbaric by nature. Barbaric people deserve to be in barbaric forests and wastelands.”
“Ahaha. Nice one. Civilized living is for civilized people, after all.”
“Speaking of which, even if those people decide to get married to a normal person in the country, in most cases they tend to look for a person who has no parents or relatives. Also, they prefer young ones, those who are barely old enough to get married.”
“Ah——, oh no. Then that means, if we get married to these people, we can no longer return to the country?”
“So those guys are pedophiles too?” “Disgusting…. They should die.”
“Then once they get married, they can only come into the country once a month?”
“Yikes! That’s horrendous. I wonder, what sort of lifestyle do they have? Not that I’m particularly interested.”
“I heard a rumor that whenever those guys come into the country, they wear hats, masks and gloves, and never take them off even in summer. Now that’s extremely creepy. And it seems that they don’t reveal their lifestyles even to their closest friends.”
“Wow, so terrible.”
“Those kinds of humans should never have been born. That’s what I think.”
“Indeed. In any case, if you were born as an inspector, you’d be one your whole life. That’s so crazy. If it were me, I’d commit suicide.”
“Well by law, everyone’s free to choose their own career. For instance, they can become a teacher inside the country if they want. … Anyway, I don’t think those people are fit for other jobs. If one of them said they wanted a normal job, that may be something worth seeing.”
“No, I don’t want to see it! If an inspector applies for the same job as I have, I’ll say ‘It’s regrettable, but we can’t accept you because the documents were lost accidentally.’ I don’t want to get contaminated.”
“That’s only a rational decision by a rational person. I’ll do the same thing. If there was an exam, I’ll fail him no matter how high his score was. That’s because if an inspector gets hired, the customers will all go away.”
“Hey everyone, let’s stop this talk about trash. It’s a waste of time. Let’s just protect our beautiful culture and carry on with our wonderful lives. There’s no need for us at all to sympathize with the needy.”
“That’s right.” “Well said.” “I agree.”
“Come. Let’s return to our lives——”


There was a small guard post beside the gates just outside the walls.
Over there, a man was sitting and leisurely reading a book. He was probably around thirty years old. The words ‘immigration inspector’ was embroidered on the white shirt he was wearing.
Kino knocked on the window of the guard post. The inspector placed the book on top of the desk, stood up and went out through the door.
Kino asked the inspector, “Excuse me. I’ll be leaving the country right away. What about the departure procedures?”
“There’s no need. You didn’t undergo entry procedures either, after all,” the inspector said, and grinned, “Well, you probably understand the reason right?”
Kino nodded. “Yes, I understand very well. Up to now, I’ve been around various places, but this one set a new record for my shortest stay in any country.”
“In any case, please don’t feel violated. All the people in this country feel like that.”
“It sure looks that way. None of them seems to be joking around. Anyway, what is a ×××××, really?”
“Ah. It seems that it was not like that in the past. The leader that time said, ‘Because a ××××× is ×××××, we can’t ×××××’. From then on, it’s ×××××. Ever since, it has always been ×××××. Probably, ××××× is ×××××.”
“I see.” “I understand.”
Kino nodded, and Hermes murmured with profound emotion.
“Even though you took the trouble to come here, I hope you don’t feel bad.”
“Not at all! It was very interesting,” Kino said with a smile.
“I thought you’d say that. All travelers do,” the inspector said, looking amused.
Kino looked up at the towering walls beside her.
“These walls are also amazing. It’s the first time I’ve seen something like this.”
“Isn’t it?” The inspector nodded and raised his head.
The grey walls the two were looking at had no top. Extended right above it was a gently drawn curve which eventually merges with the walls on the opposite side. The entire country was covered with a concrete dome.[3]
“It was completely enclosed. I was very surprised when I saw the interior.”
“It was like a super-duper humongous egg. When we saw it from afar, we thought it was some sort of a mountain,” Hermes said.
“Since when was it like this?” Kino asked.
“Too bad, but I don’t know. All we do know is that it might have existed back in my great-great-great-great grandfather’s time. It was in one of his remaining drawings.”
“Oh…” 
Kino looked up at the walls again.
“However, it was such a dirty country, Kino. No, not the people, but the town.”
As Hermes said this, the inspector nodded several times.
“Yeah, it’s so dirty…. Isn’t that terrible? It’s like that all over the country. As you can see, on top of the enclosed space, they basically have no sense of hygiene at all. I don’t know if you noticed it, but everyone lets their kitchen waste and sewage flow into the street. Upstream the river flowing from the north, the water is clear and there are many fish, but downstream it becomes pitch black you can no longer tell what’s flowing in it. It’s untouchable. Inside the houses, there are swarms of rats, and there are also lots of cockroaches.”
“What’s a ‘cockroach’?” Kino asked the inspector. 
The inspector spread his thumb and index finger apart.
“It’s an insect, but it’s about this big. It is flat, oval in shape, and looks greasy. It’s often seen coming out of the kitchen.”
“Kino, haven’t you seen a cockroach before?” Hermes asked.
Kino shook her head. “Nope.”
“That’s good for you, Miss Kino. It’s a pretty disgusting sight whenever you see it crawling around in the dining area or in the bedroom. Well, of course it’s like that inside the country. There was a time when I saw a number of them being boiled thoroughly in the hotel cafeteria’s serving pot…. Ah, well let’s leave it at that.”
The inspector shook his head and hands with an anguished expression.
“I see…. Insects which I haven’t seen before; it would be nice to see them for a bit,” Kino said without changing her expression.
“Stop, stop! In this world, there are things that you’re better off not knowing at all. A cockroach is one such thing.”
“Is that so?” Kino asked with a straight face.
“Yes, that’s right,” the inspector said with a wry smile, and then continued. “Well, now that I think about it, I don’t know if I can bear living in such a place. I can’t stay there long without gloves and a mask. However…, those people will never know the outside world from birth until death. Of course, they think that’s the best thing. That’s what they were taught as they grew up. People who live in paradise don’t dream of new lands.”
“I see,” Kino said, and turned her gaze at the opposite side of the walls.
The cool breeze blew over the bright green meadows under the clear sky. On both sides of the road due east were neatly trimmed fields. A dark coniferous forest spread out from afar.
Beside a stream a little ways off the walls was the wooden house of the inspector, with its waterwheel turning about leisurely. A woman who seemed to be the inspector’s wife was drying laundry. Beside, two children were playing with a swing suspended from a tree.
“It’s such a nice place, isn’t it?” Kino said.
“Thanks. I also like it here,” the inspector said with a sigh.
“Even Kino can live longer if she stays in a place like this forever,” Hermes teased.
The inspector chuckled, “That may be true. We inspectors usually don’t die before we see the faces of our grandchildren. However, the people inside the country only live long enough to see their children graduate. Most of them die due to disease. It’s because of the poor hygiene and the filthy air. Frankly speaking, it’s dangerous in there. They will never be attacked by wild animals or be hit by enemy bullets, but they’re in danger nevertheless.”
Kino nodded lightly, and looked at the meadows once more.


“There’s a detour road along the northern walls. If you arrive in front of the western gates, it will be a good idea to stop by since my older sister and cousin are the inspectors over there. You can find accommodations, portable rations and fuel there. If it’s not much of a bother, please tell them my family and I are doing well,” the inspector said to Kino who was ready to depart.
“Thank you very much. I’ll tell them.”
“Thanks for everything.”
Kino put on her hat, and when she was about to ride Hermes,
“Miss Kino,” the inspector asked all of a sudden. “What does ‘true blue sky’ mean?”
“Eh?” Kino turned around.
“‘True blue sky’. I’m not referring to its literal meaning,” the inspector slowly repeated.
“It’s just like a riddle, eh?” Kino said with a wry smile.
The inspector nodded. “Yeah, you can think of it that way. ――The people in the country thinks of the painted interior illuminated with fluorescent lights as their true blue sky. Well…, if the traveler Kino were to be asked the question, ‘What does ‘true blue sky’ mean to you?’ what would be your answer?”
Kino seemed a little troubled for a while, and then, 
“… I see. I will answer this. ‘There’s no such thing.’”
“Why is that?” The inspector asked immediately.
Kino answered with a gentle tone, “The sky’s blueness… changes so much depending on the place, time, season and weather. And each one of them was beautiful. In those times I didn’t think much of them, but now that I recall, I think they’re all beautiful. I can’t tell you which one is the ‘true blue sky’ among all of the skies I’ve seen. … That’s why, ‘there’s no such thing.’ The ‘me’ right now thinks so.”
The inspector gazed at Kino as he listened to her. Then, he nodded several times.
“Ah, I see…. There was that sort of answer too….”
Hermes asked the muttering inspector, “Who had?”
“My grandfather,” the inspector answered immediately.
Kino gave him a questioning look for a moment. And then,
“I see. You were asked the same question by your grandfather, right?”
“Exactly. It was when my grandfather was on the verge of death. At that time, I was still too young to discern things. He said this: ‘It doesn’t matter whether you find the ‘true blue sky’ or not. I asked, ‘What are you talking about?’ And he said while laughing, ‘That’s why it doesn’t matter whether you understand or not. Goodbye, Lügner, my dear grandson.’ And then he died…. Since then, I would vaguely think from time to time what ‘true blue sky’ really means….”
The inspector turned his back to the wall and looked at the blue sky.
“I don’t know if your answer is correct or not. But…, I’m glad I asked you. Thanks,” the inspector said, still looking at the sky.
Kino gazed at the same sky, and gently spoke,
“You’re welcome. This sky’s blue is also very beautiful.”















"
3,v1c4,1,4,"It was a tall, dense forest where a variety of grass and trees flourished. The afternoon light peeked faintly through the gaps between the fresh green leaves. The soft chirping of birds could be heard.
A deer and its young chewed on a row of grass, slowly savoring the meal.
Suddenly, the parent deer raised its head. Its offspring was still engrossed with the grass. Along with the sound of grass being brushed away, a human suddenly leaped out from a thicket.
The deer, startled, became petrified. The human, also startled, aimed the persuader (Note: A gun) she was holding towards these figures.
It was a young person. She seemed about halfway through her teens, or perhaps a bit less. She had on blue trousers covered with dirt and a somewhat thick, green-colored jacket. She wore a brimmed hat with flaps that covered her ears, and for some reason there were goggles over her eyes. The expression behind the goggles was rigid, and she appeared fearful.
The human, watching the deer disappear, let out a breath. After a short break, she ran off once again. The persuader she held was a slide-action shotgun, with a tubular magazine attached underneath the barrel.
After running for a bit, the human concealed herself by sliding behind a thick tree. Immediately, she aimed her persuader in the direction from which she had come. Opening her large eyes wider, subduing her breath, she searched for something.
Finally, a thicket rustled softly. The human reflexively aimed at it and fired. With a thunderous roar, the grass of the thicket danced wildly. There was no one there.
The human clicked her tongue without raising her voice and fled from behind the tree. With her left hand, she slid the fore grip underneath the barrel back and forth. A spent shell flied out and the next charge was loaded.
Holding her head low, she ran desperately without looking behind her. After jumping over several bushes, she hid herself just as she had done earlier. Her breathing became rough.
She hurriedly wiped the sweat off of her eyelids and touched the lens of her goggles with the back of her hand. Without realizing, she repeated this action several times
Suddenly, the face behind the lens slackened.
“‘Settle down, Kino. Always be calm. Save your nervousness and fear for later.’”
The human, as though someone was instructing her, muttered with a soft voice.
The human who called herself Kino, smiling softly, grasped her persuader again. She produced a single round from the pouch on her waist, and inserted it inside the magazine.
Holding her persuader reverently in both hands, Kino closed her eyes. She seemed to be in a meditative state under the shadow of the tree.
Several seconds passed in silence as she remained there, unmoving.
Rustle.
From a place not far from where she was, the sound of something lightly stepping through grass could be heard.
Rustle. It sounded. The small sound became louder.
Rustle. Again. It came closer and closer.
Rustle. One more time. Kino slowly opened her eyes.
Upon hearing the next sound, Kino pointed her persuader in the direction it came from. She fired.
The shot only went through the blades of grass. A little to the left, the thicket quivered. Kino loaded the next round and aimed. The moment she was about to fire, a person’s hand appeared in the shadow of a tree to the right, aiming a hand persuader towards her. Kino frantically shifted her aim, and was shot at just before she was able to perceive the line of fire.
The bullet hit her hat on the part where her forehead should be, and bound back. It hit the branch of a neighboring tree, bounced, and fell on top of the ground a bit ways off. It was a spherical rubber bullet, with a diameter of about ten millimeters.
“How are you doing, Kino?”
Asking this, the human who had shot Kino appeared from behind the tree.
It was an old woman with a smile lingering on her face. She had a slender body and her silver hair was neatly tied behind. She had slim trousers on, and wore a light green cardigan above her shirt. She had goggles just like Kino. In her right hand was a high-caliber revolver.
“It hurts. But if I have to be specific, I’m frustrated.”
Kino was still pressing on her head, and answered with only her gaze raised.
The old woman took off Kino’s hat and goggles. The skin was torn a little bit on her forehead, and a small amount of blood was flowing out. From Kino’s jacket pocket, the old woman took out a small cloth and a tiny bottle of antiseptic solution. She wet the cloth with the solution and attached it to Kino’s forehead with tape.
“Since you’re still young, you’ve got to take care of your face,” said the old woman with a kind smile.


There was a narrow path in the forest. There, a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) was propped up on its center stand.  It called out to Kino and the old woman as they parted the grass on their way out.
“Welcome back!”
“Sorry to have kept you waiting, Hermes.”
The motorrad asked but one word to the old woman regarding Kino, who wore a heavy expression.
“Where?”
Kino, not saying anything, pointed to her forehead.
“Well, you still have a long way to go. Now, let’s go home and make something to eat.”
Saying this, the old woman put away her revolver in a handbag resting on Hermes.
As Kino passed her persuader to the old woman, she climbed onto Hermes and turned on the engine. Its blaring roar echoed through the forest.
The old woman sat sideways on a cushion spread across the rear carrier. Kino then slowly launched Hermes off.
“Kinooo, it’s no good to be depressed like that,” said Hermes as they ran. Kino remained silent despite Hermes’ words. The old woman only looked behind them with a nonchalant expression.


After running for a while, Kino suddenly stopped Hermes.
“Three people, huh?” Hermes said with a small voice. There was the usual path surrounded by the forest. However, a bit further ahead, one side of the path was cleared to give way to a field. Up ahead, a small house could be narrowly seen.
Kino turned to the old woman and asked,
“Is the gunpowder seller coming today?”
The old woman shook her head.
“No. There’s no such plan. … Kino, get down.”
“Huh?”
“On my signal, restrain the movements of those people. I will speak to them alone first.”
The old woman handed Kino the persuader that she had used earlier.
“No way…. I don’t think I can do it.”
“If something happens, then, and only then, will I help you. This is good training.”
“But…”
“Kino. Didn’t you say that you want to become stronger?” said the old woman to the hesitant Kino, a smile across her face.
“… Yes.”
Kino grasped the persuader, and nimbly disappeared into the forest.
As the old woman sat on the rider’s seat of Hermes and gripped his handlebars, Hermes spoke with a feeble voice, “Um… please don’t knock me over, okay?”
The old woman nodded several times. Holding the levers in her hands on both sides, she said, “Don’t worry, I still remember. This one’s the brake, and this one’s the clutch.”
“It’s the other way around…”


There was a small log house in the middle of the forest and the garden.
In front of the entrance, there were three men. No matter how you look at them, they appear to be thieves — a fat man, a thin man, and a man with a scar on his face. They were each holding long, rifle-type persuaders. The horses they had ridden were tied to the entrance.
The men heard the roar of a vehicle’s engine, and soon saw an old woman riding unsteadily on a motorrad. They gave a hefty sigh.
The woman somehow managed to stop Hermes in front of the house and the three men.
“No, that’s not how you do it! Put the kickstand down with that foot…”
“This one? Oh, this protrusion. Now I remember.”
“That’s right. Ah, but the ground is weak… use the center sta…”
“Here you go.”
The old woman finally managed to put out the side stand, picked up her handbag and dismounted. The side stand slowly sank into the ground and Hermes collapsed to the side.
“Horrible…”
One of the thieves stepped forward.
“Is this your place, old lady?” he asked in a loud, crude voice.
The old woman bowed,
“It’s rare for us to have visitors. Come in and I’ll make you some tea.”
The thieves snorted.
“Tea would be great, since, after all, we’ll be taking all that you have that’s of any value! If you do as we say, maybe we’ll spare you your life. Or else——”
“Or else what?”
“We’ll beat you up in this place and you’ll expose the air to the stench of your putrid corpse.”
“You are threatening me, are you not?” the woman asked as if seeking confirmation, and the thief answered with a hoarse voice,
“That’s right! Old lady, is your Alzheimer’s kicking in? Can you even hear me?”
The old woman put her handbag in front of her.
“I can hear you. ——Kino, do it.”
Kino jumped out from the forest and fired. A rubber bullet hit the fat man squarely in the head, and he fell over sideways. Crashing into the tall man’s chest, she hit him hard in his nether region with the stock of her persuader, then whirled around and delivered an uppercut to his jaw. Using the fallen body as a shield, Kino went for the last man, shooting both of his hands.
“Ugh… huh?”
Dropping his weapon and grabbing his pained hands, the man with a scar on his face let out a yell. His two partners were lying horizontally on the ground, completely unconscious.
Kino continued to aim at the man carefully. To his side, the old woman spoke.
“Hey…”
“Wah!” the man winced.
“Don’t be afraid, we won’t take your lives. Instead…”
“Y-yes…?”
“Please take out anything of value that you have.”
“Huh?”
“If you’ve done other jobs before this, you must have something, right? So, like I said, give me your valuables please. Or else…”
“… O-or else what?”
The old woman gave him a sweet smile.
“Oh my, you must know, don’t you?”
Seeing the man nod over and over, Hermes, still on the ground, muttered,
“Demon…”


“If you go on from here for about half a day, you should be able to see a river. It’s pretty shallow, so I’m sure you can cross with a horse. ——But, until you reach that place, you must never look back.”
Listening to these last few words of the old woman, the pale-faced thieves took their leave.
Her face filled with curiosity, Kino followed them with her eyes.
The old woman, who was carrying a bread basket full of gems and bracelets, spoke to Kino, “You did wonderfully. Well, let’s prepare some food.”
Kino looked at the old woman and nodded.
As the two turned on their heels and were about to enter the house, Hermes spoke.
“Pick me up first…”


It was evening inside the forest.
Kino went out from the back of the house, holding an adze. Hermes was propped up next to the window.
In a nearby clearing, there was a mountain of firewood yet to be chopped, and a tree stump cut down obliquely, its tree rings facing towards the house.
“Hey, Hermes.”
Kino spoke suddenly as she selected several pieces of firewood.
“Yeah?”
“If those thieves are so weak, why were they going around stealing stuff?”
“……”
“I don’t really want to say this, but… was I really in any danger?” 
“… Well, it doesn’t mean that those guys are particularly weak…,” Hermes said in a low voice to Kino who had a doubtful look on her face.
“Huh?”
Kino turned around. There was a small bruise on her forehead.
“No, it’s nothing. More than that, just hurry and finish chopping the wood.”
“Okay.”
Kino placed the firewood on the slanted tree stump.
She went over to where Hermes was, and picked the adze back up.
“Hup!”
She threw it at the firewood.
The adze spun twice in midair, and cut the firewood clean in half.














"
4,v1c5,1,5,"It was as if the place was filled with low tables.
Amidst a land of brown earth and stone, there were numerous hills with flat summits. In between the hills were marks of rain carving out a formerly level land. In addition to this, weathering has flattened out the bottoms of the valleys. In the valleys and hills, not a single blade of grass grew.
The sky was blue, and it seemed transparent. In the higher areas, thin lines of clouds flowed.
There was a single path. It can only be seen as a white line from afar; it runs flat as it rose through the hills, and still runs flat as it descended into the valleys.
Kicking up dry dust, a single motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) ran.
The motorrad was fully loaded with traveling luggage. There were boxes attached to both sides of the rear wheel, and there was a large suitcase and a sleeping bag fastened to its top. To the side hung a small silver cup, dancing.
The rider was wearing a brown coat, the long hem of which was wrapped up to her thighs. She was wearing a hat with flaps that covered her ears, as well as goggles. She had a bandana around her face to protect it from the dust.
The motorrad climbed up the slopes of a hill, and soon ran atop the tables made by nature. When she was about to approach the downward slope, the rider suddenly stopped the motorrad. She slightly locked the rear wheels and let it slide. The dust wrapped around the motorrad and the rider, and soon cleared up.
“Can you see it, Hermes?” said the rider, pulling her bandana down. It was a young face. She was around her teens.
The motorrad called Hermes responded, “Yup, I see it. It’s pretty amazing.”
“Yeah,” the rider nodded.
They were looking down on a valley whose width was incomparable to the others. The hill on the other side could barely be seen at all. And in the center of that valley, there was a country.
The tall walls were built around the country in an enormous circle. At its center, large cluster of buildings and the streets lined up within them could be seen. A vivid green forest surrounded the country. Spread across the forest were several ponds filled with bright green water.
A brown wilderness and a green forest. The interior and the periphery of this circle were two completely different worlds.
“Kino, what is that water?” Hermes asked. The rider called Kino responded.
“Probably underground waterway pulses. The enormous river formed by this valley must still be flowing in places deep underground.”
“Ooh, I see. Let’s hurry and visit the place! I’m really interested in seeing an amazing country located in such an amazing place,” Hermes said happily.
“Me too.” Kino put her bandana back on.
She launched Hermes and descended into the valley in high spirits.


Someone was peering at Kino and Hermes from far, far away through a pair of high-magnification binoculars. They dug a hole in the ground and covered it with a cloth of the same color.
That someone clicked his tongue. “This is bad…. They’re going to enter that country.”
Someone next to that person asked, “It’s a traveler, right? Do you think they’re not aware of the horrors that await them in that country?”
The first person slightly stiffened his voice and spat, “Who on earth would enter if they knew…? The person continued,
“Sergeant, get in touch with headquarters. Tell them we’re in a state of emergency.”


The gate on this country’s walls was only located in one place. Kino went around the wall until she reached the other side.
In front of the gate was a small guardroom, in which a young man and a young woman served as both guards and immigration examiners.
Kino informed the examiners that she was entering the country for a three-day period for the purpose of sightseeing and recreation. The examiners told her that there was one condition.
“Before entering the country, you will have to undergo a blood inspection, Miss Kino. This is in order to ensure that you will not bring in any dangerous diseases. The inspection will take a little bit of your time. Do you accept this?”
Kino asked what she would specifically have to do, and the examiner replied that they will be taking a sample of blood from her arm with a needle.
“……”
Seeing from her silence that she was conflicted, Hermes spoke up. “What’s wrong Kino? … Don’t tell me you’re afraid of needles, hm?”
“It’s nothing like that at all!” was her immediate response. She politely let the examiner lead her, and then disappeared into the interior of the guardroom.
After a while, Kino came out with a tired face.
“No matter how many times I do this, I still couldn’t stand it…” she muttered in a small voice to herself.
The sun was slowly, but steadily setting.
“I’m sorry, but it will take quite some time,” said the male examiner to Kino, who was absentmindedly sitting on Hermes.
After a long wait, when the sun had completely set, the examiner came out of the gatehouse.
“The results of the inspection are in. It’s okay for you to enter. Thank you for waiting.”
Kino struck the sleeping Hermes awake. With the saluting examiner behind them, she passed through the gates pushing Hermes along.
When they entered the country, they were greeted with a forest spreading out before them in the dim shadow of the wall. A large car was parked in front of Kino and Hermes, and there were several people who seemed to have been waiting for them. There was one man and one woman, along with two younger women.
“Welcome, miss traveler. We have been waiting for you. Since it’s quite late already, we will lead you to the hotel by car.”
After being told such, Kino was about to thank the man when she caught a glimpse of his face. She was startled.
It was the examiner who had been at the gate before.
“No… It can’t be…,” Kino muttered under her breath. No matter how she looked at him, it was evident that the man before her was over fifty years old. It was a different person.
Kino expressed her thanks to this man, and turned to the woman beside him. She became speechless.
The middle-aged woman had the exact same face as the female examiner, but her age was obviously greater. However, the two people behind them were, aside from the clothes, exactly the same as the female examiner. Standing there were two of the same person. 
With a smile, the middle aged woman informed her that they were the managers of the hotel. She introduced the two young women, who, apparently, were their daughters. Upon hearing this,
“Thank you… very much…” Kino said with a wholly confused expression. They took Kino and Hermes into their car and drove off to the hotel.
On the way, the middle-aged woman spoke to Kino. “Sorry about the long wait you had to endure. The immigration rules in this country are much stricter than those of other countries. Despite that, I hope you enjoy your stay.”
Kino gave half-hearted replies to the rest of the conversation.


After arriving at the hotel, Kino and Hermes were led into the lobby. It was a splendid and pretty hotel, but there were no other guests to be seen. At the front desk was a lone young man in a business suit, with the exact same face as the examiner. Only his hairstyle and way of speaking were different.
Two bellboy-looking youths expressly removed Kino’s luggage from Hermes and carried it off. They both had the same face as the examiner and the man at the front desk.
“……”
The wordless Kino and Hermes were led into a large room. Kino asked the bellboy who led her into the room how much it would cost her to stay.
“For guests from the outside, it’s completely free. Please, take it easy. If there’s anything you need, call us anytime with the signal bell.”
He bowed and left.
After the door closed, Kino spent a while thinking, and then stood up.
“Hey, Hermes.”
“Hmm?”
Kino made sure that no one else was in the room, and then asked, “Haven’t you noticed anything strange about everyone we’ve met today? The examiner, the man at the front desk, the bellboy, and then the owner and his family? They’re all the same. And the women, too. At first I thought they were triplets, but then…”
“Maybe, but aren’t you thinking about it too much?”
“But…”
“Everyone in this country probably have the same face. Maybe you didn’t see when we were outside, but all the people walking, man or woman, had the same face,” Hermes said nonchalantly. Kino stopped her hand as she was taking off her coat.
“But… how?” Kino asked, considerably puzzled.
“Uh… hmm…” Hermes thought for a moment.
“Maybe they’re all made in the same assembly line from the same factory? If that’s the case, then it’s not really strange, is it?” he then said in his usual tone.
“……”
While folding her coat, Kino looked at Hermes with a shocked face.
“What? Why are you making that face?”
“… Today tired me out, so I’m going to sleep now. Maybe we can see tomorrow if it wouldn’t be too rude to ask them about it.”
“Okay!”
Kino unfastened her waist belt and removed the black jacket she was wearing. At the same time, she also removed the holster of her hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun, in this case, a pistol).
Kino took a shower. Then she lay on her side on the neat bed and fell asleep instantly.


The morning of the next day, Kino woke up at dawn. The weather was good.
She practiced with her persuaders for a while, and then performed maintenance on them. She then did some light exercise.
When the sun fully rose, she looked outside through the window and saw the pretty townscape and green trees.
In her room, Kino ate her breakfast. Just as before, the bellboy, the man at the front desk, and the chef who prepared her meal in front of her all had the exact same face.


After breakfast, Kino woke Hermes up, put on her jacket, and went downstairs to the lobby.
Outside of the hotel, there were about twenty people. Kino and Hermes observed them beyond the glass windows. Their ages were different, but every man and woman had the same face.
Hermes asked Kino, “Aren’t you surprised?”
Kino shook her head lightly. “… I’ve already gotten used to it.”
“Really now.”
The hotel owner was leading a man who looked to be around his late thirties. He had the same face as everybody else.
“Good morning, Miss Kino, Mister Hermes. I’m from the town hall. In case you need one, I came to be your tour guide. How does that sound? I can answer any question you have about this country.”
“Thank you very much. I’ll take you up on your offer…. There’s one question I would like to ask right away,” said Kino to the guide.
“Yes, what is it… is what I would like to say, but the truth is I already know what your question will be… ‘Why does everyone here have the same face?’ am I right?” the guide said with a smile.
Kino nodded. The guide also nodded.
“I will explain everything. At the same time, there is also a place I would like to show you. Please come with me into the car.”


Followed by several identical smiles, Kino and Hermes got into the car.
Soon they arrived at a large, square building with white walls and no windows.
When they entered, they were led into a classy-looking reception office. Kino sat in a chair, and Hermes stood on his kickstand beside her.
“We formally welcome you to our country. With that, I will proceed to answer your question from earlier.”
The guide put up an air of importance around him.
“All of us are clones.”


“Huh? What’s a ‘clone’?” Kino asked.
“Speaking from definition, clones are ‘life forms with the exact same structural information’.”
“‘Structural information’?”
“Yes. In each and every living thing, there is ‘structural information’, that is to say, a ‘blueprint’ of sorts. This blueprint is very, very small, but in accordance with the different kinds of blueprints, many species of living things could be made. But even within an individual species, the form and shape are subtly different. In the case of humans, facial structure, skin color, hair color, eye color – these can all be different. The differences in the ‘information’ bring about the differences in each life form, and in the case of humans, in each individual. ——Do you understand up to this point?”
“Y-yes…” Kino said with a meek expression.
“Well, living things with no difference in their ‘structural information’ are called clones. For example, if you break off a branch of a tree and plant it in the ground, a tree will grow in that spot, right? Having done this, you just made one more tree with exactly the same ‘structural information’ using the first tree. This is also a clone. Do you follow so far?”
Kino nodded, “I understand. That’s called grafting, right?”
“That’s right. A clone, by nature, is a ‘small branch’.”
The guide continued. “And that is exactly what we are doing, but with humans. The men, the women, each and every one of them came from the foundational model of a single person. They are all clones. In layman’s terms, you could call them ‘copy humans’. I think that at this point, you understand why we all have the same face.”
“Yeah, I totally understand. Rather, you make it seem so logical; any other way would seem strange,” Hermes said.
Kino glanced at Hermes, and then asked the guide, “But… all of this… how?”
“You are asking how it is that we produce these clones?”
“Yes.”
“Originally, a boy or girl would develop to a certain degree individually, and as a result, a baby would be born from a woman’s womb. But with this method, the child’s ‘structural information’ would be a mixture of two others; so a boy would not be exactly like the father, and a girl would not be exactly like the mother. That is why we use a different method.”
Kino asked, “That is to say… a ‘stamen’ and a ‘pistil’ and those sorts of things aren’t needed at all for this method of yours?”
The guide gave a faint smile. “That is correct. Incidentally, there is no ‘stork’ involved either.”
Kino opened her eyes and lightly bit her lower lip, and leaned forward slightly.
“Um… that specific method, can you explain it to me in a way that I can understand, please?”
The guide answered, “Of course. That is the reason I invited you here. This facility was made for the purpose of carrying out that method. However, before I take you inside, let me give you a simple background of this country’s history.”
“Long ago, a man and woman stumbled upon this land where no one lived, and not even grass grew. Those two people were the ‘originals’ of every citizen of this country.
“The two had been born and raised in another country far, far away. There, they had studied biology and medicine. However, the research they proposed, that is to say, the cloning of humans, was rejected by others. Finally, they received orders to halt their research.
“The two decided to leave the country. They loaded all of the equipment they had developed in an enormous truck, and left on a journey to seek a new world where no one would get in their way.
“Then, the two found and dug up an underground water source. With their water troubles dispelled, they planted vegetables and began to raise grain and livestock.
“At the same time, in order to test the fruits of their research, they created clones of themselves. The babies who were safely born in this land were raised by the two as their own children.
“Finally, with an increase in crop production and a stable population, that is to say, more mouths to feed, this country was officially born. For hundreds of years since then, we have continued our sound way of living.”


“With that, let us go.”
Kino and Hermes continued through a passageway, led by the guide.
They passed by several people in lab coats who all, of course, had the same face. They went through several rigorous checkpoints, and finally arrived in front of a single door.
The guide announced their arrival and exclaimed jokingly, “Welcome to the ‘cabbage patch’!”
He opened the door.
There was a long passageway behind it. On one side of the passageway, the wall was made entirely of glass.
While pushing along Hermes, Kino slowly stepped inside.
On the other side of the glass was an area that was somewhat wider than the passageway. On the other side, several black glass tubes that looked like thick pillars were lined up evenly.
“Those glass tubes are our ‘wombs’. Look at number fourteen, if you will.”
The guide said, and pushed the switch he was holding.
The blackness in the tube began to fade. There was something in the center of the liquid-filled glass tube.
Soon its form was revealed. It was small, with arms and legs pointing downwards, and a large head. There was a tube extending upward attached to its belly button.
“A baby… before it’s born…,” Kino muttered.
“Amaaazing…,” said Hermes happily.
“Correct. That is a fetus. It has been about thirty-five weeks since this child was conceived. It’s flailing about, so I’m turning off the lights,” the guide said.
The tube was once more immersed in color, and soon became as black as it had been before.
“All of the fetuses are raised like this. After one is fully grown, it is removed from this facility. In other words, it is ‘born’. After that, things are just like in any other country. Now as to what you asked specifically earlier…”
Kino turned to the guide.
“There are several ways, but what we do now is like this. There are two things needed: First is the ‘structural information’ of a man if it is a man we want to make, and that of a woman, otherwise. As to which body it will be taken from, it doesn’t matter. Once that information is taken, it will not result in the creation of anything but the part it is taken from, so if it is taken from a hand, then a hand is what we will get. The same goes for a foot; structural information from there will form a foot. This is a rather shoddy way of doing things, but if we gather information from all parts of the body, we will eventually be able to produce an entire body. The second thing needed is an unfertilized egg cell. We will collect this from a woman, and put it in cold storage. Do you understand me up to this point?”
“Somehow…, I think I get it.”
“Yeah, I get it.”
After confirming Kino and Hermes’ understanding, the guide continued his explanation.
“Next, using a terribly precise operation, we will move the ‘structural information’ into the egg exactly as it is. Doing so, the egg cell will now be carrying this ‘structural information’ and will become a fertilized egg. Then, this fertilized egg will be grown in a ‘womb’ for 265 days. ——Are you starting to understand what is going on?”
“I see… I think I’m starting to see the general picture.”
“Hey, it’s just like I said, Kino. This place is a factory, right?” Hermes said to Kino.
‘Hahaha!’ the guide laughed. “It is indeed just as Mister Hermes says! Instead of domestic production as was done long ago, we do it in a factory with a perfect quality control system. Thanks to this, things like ‘stillbirth’, ‘miscarriage’, and ‘infertility’, are now dead words in our country. Almost no one is aware of them.”
Kino asked the guide a question. “Doesn’t anyone wish to have children the normal…, I mean, old way? I know I’m uninformed, but after you substitute the ‘information’, isn’t it possible to naturally return the egg cell to a woman’s body…?”
The guide looked a bit taken aback.
“Your question does not sound the least bit uninformed. What you just said now, Miss Kino, is unmistakably possible. Actually, we use this method to increase the number of our livestock. After all, that method does not take too much time and effort. However… there is practically no one among us who will do it that way. There is no record of anyone ever having done so. There is also the matter of the nine months’ gestation period, and no one could even imagine going through so much trouble. They will be unable to do work. Other than that, there is the possibility of the pregnancy complications I mentioned earlier. To put it in other words, who would want to chop wood, now that we boil our water electronically and automatically?”
“I see…”
“Pretty convincing.”
Kino and Hermes said.
Becoming slightly garrulous, the guide continued. “Ah, but you see, the notion of ‘stamen and pistil, and so on’ has survived splendidly. In this country it is a method of relaxation, basically an ‘activity done by two people’; a sport. It is something not far removed from tennis. Miss Kino, would you like to try it during your stay?”
“…… Ah, no, I’ll have to decline,” said Kino.


On the path, a group of married couples entered. Of course, the men had the same face as the guide, and the women had the same face as one another. The women were slightly plump.
Seeing the guide, one of the women let out a surprised voice.
“Oh? It’s rare that we meet here. Are you on break from your town hall duties? You couldn’t possibly be skipping out on your work or anything, could you?”
“That’s mean. I am working, you know. I am doing guide work; it has been a while since I last had to show a visitor around. Everyone, this is Miss Kino and Mister Hermes.”
Kino bowed, and Hermes said ‘hello’.
“Oh, you’re the travelers who arrived yesterday. Welcome!” the woman said cheerfully, and beckoned Kino and the others over with her hand.
“Look, my daughter’s here. I want everyone to meet her. Come, come. She’s number twenty-five!”
Everyone walked ahead, and looked inside tube twenty-five.
Inside the tube, there was nothing.
The woman pulled out a pair of binoculars, and looked inside of the glass tube. She grinned, and then handed the binoculars to Kino.
Kino peered through them. In the center, a tiny, tiny something was barely visible.
“Can you see her? You can see her, right?”
“Y-yeah…,” was all Kino managed to say.
“Isn’t she cute? She’s so adorable, isn’t she?” The woman began to shower Kino with questions.
“…… Yeah…”
She was ecstatic. “Even though it’s only been six weeks, she’s already starting to look as cute as me!”
“……”
The guide helped Kino, who had no idea what to say, out of the situation.
“W-well, how about I show you around the educational facility?”


The guide led Kino and Hermes out of the ‘cabbage patch’ and took them down an ordinary-looking hallway.
“What exactly is the educational facility?” Kino asked.
“It is just as the name would indicate. It is a place where eligible individuals are taught various things. First, I will explain who these eligible individuals are.”
The guide explained as he walked. “In this country, people over sixteen years of age who desire to have children must undergo an examination. Married or not, the questions are based around confirming the ability of the individuals to raise a child properly. There are several primary factors for this. The person’s bodily and mental state, their economic status, their job or educational status, their experience with raising children, whether or not they have people in their neighborhood that can help them, for instance family, are all tested. Their documents are inspected, they go through an interview, notes are taken on them, then they practice, among other things, and finally, an examination in an isolated facility lasting ten days is performed. In order to see if the person has tendencies toward violence, they are put in a simulated state where they are unable to do as they please, and then pushed to the limit psychologically. We judge their ability to cope, and unless they score ninety-eight points or more on this test, they will not be qualified to receive a child.”
“Pretty strict, isn’t it?” said Hermes.
“Yes, it is indeed very strict. No matter how many times I see it happen, I still think it is strict, but…”
“But?” Kino asked.
The guide looked forward, his expression resolute.
“If people who desire a child are not able to pass such strict tests, then they could not possibly be ready for something like parenthood. If someone is not willing to bestow kind, calm, and unconditional affection upon their child, then they are not fit to be parents. Having a child is not like buying a pet turtle or iguana. You are bringing a single human into the world, and you have almost complete control over their life…. As a human, is there a greater responsibility than that? No, absolutely not!” the guide recited passionately, his hands curling into fists.
“People who think of raising children as a game, people who have children so that they can show them off to others, people who make their children into personal slaves and force them to do the impossible, people who selfishly turn their children into their heirs, locking them up and taking away their freedom to do what they want in life, people who use their children for ‘recreation’ when they are stressed or dead drunk ——these sort of parents are yet to be ‘born’, and if you look at our history, not one child has been raised in an unhealthy way, not even excluding certain isolation orders received from town hall. In order to prevent this country from sinking into ruin, having people who want to become parents take this difficult test is a top priority. This institution does not only produce children, but also parents.”
“I see…. In one country I visited, there was a saying: ‘I’d like to see how his parents are like.’[2]” Kino said.
“‘I’d like to see how his parents are like,’ eh? Those are fine words indeed…. I’ll remember them. Incidentally, in this country, if a parent murders their child, they are given a death sentence without question. If a child murders a parent, however, it is not considered a crime no matter what the age of the child or their reason for doing it. It is only natural, because after all, children were raised by their parents. If the child you raised would strike, kick, or even kill you, then you have no right to complain. It is entirely the fault of the parents who raised the child. You just have to accept it.”
“……”
“……”
Then, the guide stopped at the end of the hallway which was lined up with several chairs.
“I’m sorry, we passed over the door,” the guide said.


“… And then, the people who have passed the examination, that is to say, the eligible individuals, will be waiting as ‘parents-in-training’. This will continue for the same amount of time as the case I first mentioned earlier — 265 days, in other words, the same amount of time it takes for a fetus to fully grow.”
Passing through a door, Kino, Hermes, and the guide went along a different path. Half of the surface of the floor was made of glass, and underneath, there was an area that looked similar to a classroom.
“Please, take a look.”
In the room that the guide pointed out, there were ten or so people practicing infant bathing with dolls. In a neighboring classroom, a study session with people using notes and textbooks was being held. Next to that room, a class on making baby food was being conducted. The male to female ratio was exactly one to one. Everyone was frantic.
“Yes, as you can see, everyone masters the techniques required for raising a child. There is also a final examination, and until you pass, you cannot embrace your child. Because everyone is so determined, none of them fail the exam.”
“I see,” Kino muttered as she looked below.
“And finally, the day they have been waiting for, the ‘birth’, finally arrives. It is the first time they can hold their child with their own hands. … It is truly a moving experience, to take a small life made entirely from your own ‘information’ into your hands. Even though everyone knows that in this country, the men are all the same as the men, and the women are all the same as the women, their own child is still more special than the rest. And in the case of married people like me, the wife I love and my daughters, who are just like her, are much more special to me than anybody else.”
The guide narrowed his eyes and continued.  “Unfortunately, there are no births scheduled for either today or tomorrow. I cannot show you the profound emotion during the moment of birth. That is my one regret.”


After they finished their tour of the classrooms, Kino, Hermes, and the guide returned to the reception room.
The guide gave Kino one final piece of information.
“Our country has one immense weak point,” he said with a grave face.
“Weak point?” Kino asked.
“Yes, and that is disease. The thorough blood inspection that you had to go through before entering the country could not be overlooked even the tiniest bit, because we have to be certain that you are not bringing any foreign diseases into the country. Even if it might be something commonly suffered by people born in your country of birth, it may be lethal to the ‘two individuals’, from which all of us clones came from. Do you understand what I mean?”
The guide gave a little quiz, and Kino replied slowly, confirming her understanding. “… You mean to say, because everyone here is exactly the same, if a disease affects one person, there is a danger that it will affect everyone else as well. With just a single disease, the entire population could be obliterated.”
“It’s similar to how motorrads made in the same place, on the same assembly line, in the same factory, will all break down the same way, right?” Hermes said. The guide nodded satisfactorily.
“That’s exactly how it is.”
“What are the actual conditions? Have there been such a crisis in the past?” Kino asked. The guide shook his head.
“Up until now, no such event has occurred. Because we carefully inspect everyone who steps in this land for possible illnesses, our children have remained. We do not intend to cut off this land from the outside. That is why we have created the checking process for the occasional traveler that comes our way. In addition, since we do it so thoroughly, there has not been any incident up to this point. The future is always uncertain, though.”
“……”
“Oh come now, this world is never completely safe,” the guide said in a bright voice to Kino, who had a serious expression on. “But…”
“But?” Kino asked.
“If you have the will to survive, it is not that easy to perish,” the guide said to her with a grin.


“With that, the tour is complete. How was it?”
“It was very interesting. I’m beyond satisfied,” Hermes said.
“That makes me very happy. How about you, Miss Kino?”
“… Out of all of the countries I’ve visited until now, this one has surprised me the most… It was a great idea to come here,” Kino said, making several small nods.
“Thank you very much. When you say that, it makes me glad to be a tour guide,” the guide said happily, looking relieved.
He then asked, “Miss Kino, I will be returning home for a while to have my lunch. Would you like to come with me? If you desire to try the homemade cooking of this country, it would be far more delicious than any restaurant you will find here. I suppose it would be a misuse of my authority to mix public and private life, but how about it?”


Kino came down from the car while pushing along Hermes. At the same time, four girls, all with the same faces and wearing the same clothes, and three boys, all with the same faces and wearing the same clothes, surrounded her.
The children were lined up in front of their home, waiting for the return of the guide.
The children looked at Kino and Hermes, and all began speaking at once to the point that Kino couldn’t understand what any of them were saying.
“Why, thank you for the reception everyone. This here is Miss Kino, a traveler. This is her partner, the motorrad Mister Hermes,” the guide said.
“Hello everyone.”
“Hello!”
And then, they were pulled along by the children who had begun to speak without regard to each other again, into the property. The guide’s wife, who had the same face as all the other women, came out to meet them in her apron.
Kino was guided through their spacious garden. Over there was a pretty lawn and plants that looked like a lot of care had gone into them, as well as a large table. On the table, dishes were arranged.
The guide told his children to line up in the order of their birth, as he was going to introduce them. The children all lined up in a row.
“Now then, starting from the right: My eldest daughter, Hen, twelve years old; my second eldest daughter, Duo, eleven years old; my eldest son Tria, ten years old.”
As the children were called, the girls grabbed the hems of their skirts and curtsied, while the boys placed their hand over their chests and bowed.
“I have two third eldest daughters, Tetra and Freja. They are both nine years old. They were born on the exact same day.”
The two, who looked every inch exactly the same as each other, bowed at exactly the same time.
“My second eldest son, Hex, eight years old; and my youngest son, Hepta, seven years old.[3] They are all my precious family…. Oh yes, and then my wife.”
“Oh, I am honored that you remember me,” his wife joked.


All of the food served at lunch could more or less be called delicious. The guide told Kino that the animals and vegetables were produced through cloning techniques, so the country never had to be worried about food.
After they had finished dessert, the children all played in the garden. The wife asked the guide if it was all right for him to skip work from the town hall. While lying down on the grass,
“My work for today is to be with the traveler. It’s fine as long as the boss doesn’t find out.”
“Dear, that is misuse of your authority, mixing public and private life, you know,” the wife, who spoke in an exasperated tone, and Kino, met eyes and smiled wryly.
Hermes, surrounded by the kids, made a splendid plaything for them.
After looking at the children for a while, Kino spoke to the guide, who was lying on his side.
“Sorry if I get it wrong. The one farthest to the left is Hen. Next is Tria, then Hepta, then Hex. The one touching Hermes’ light is Tetra, and the one behind her is Freja. The one sitting in the chair drinking tea by herself is Duo.”
“……”
The guide jumped to his feet, tossing a glance at the children.
“… That’s correct. But how in the world…?” He looked at Kino with a surprised expression.
“At first I couldn’t tell them apart, so I watched them while they ate. I was a bit surprised. The way they eat and the littlest of their gestures are all different. Later, I realized their personalities reflect the subtle differences in their outward appearance,” Kino said. The guide remained speechless for a while.
“…… You are correct, but to find out so much in such a short time… why, Miss Kino, you have excellent observational skills. Well done!”
Kino looked somewhat embarrassed.
“Incidentally, which ones were the hardest to discern?” the guide asked.
“The eldest boy, Tria, and the youngest boy, Hepta. They are about the same height, and their expressions and actions resemble one another. They’re both very obedient, aren’t they?”
“You are quite sharp. Both of them can’t stand against their older sisters. Well, I myself am no match for my wife, so it’s not that surprising. Amongst my boys, only Hex was born with some guts… Who could you tell apart immediately?”
Kino looked at the two girls standing in front of Hermes.
“Tetra and Freja, despite looking exactly the same, were unexpectedly easy to tell apart. Freja is always standing behind Tetra.”
The guide told Kino she was absolutely right, and then his expression darkened a little.
“Freja, you see, was actually not supposed to become our daughter…”
Kino turned her face to the guide.
“In this country, you cannot request two children at once. At the most, you can only have one child per year. As for Freja… the young woman who was supposed to become her mother is said to have died in an accident only two days before she was born. On the same day our Tetra was ‘born’, we received her by a special exception. ‘Freja’ was the name of that woman.”
“Is that so…”
“Of course, since she has the same ‘information’ as my wife and daughters, there have been no problems. Everyone in the family knows about Freja’s circumstances. Just…”
“Just?”
“That young woman Freja—— what happened to her is certainly regrettable. Every time that name crosses my lips, I can’t help but remember what happened to her. Because of that, I feel I have to make Freja happy for her sake, and I am always thinking of what I could do in order to achieve that.”
“……”
The guide looked at the two children for a while. As he did, Freja came over to him and invited him, telling him that since it has been a long time, she wanted to play with him for the rest of the day. The guide looked at his daughter with a slightly troubled face.
Kino suddenly stood up.
“Well then, it’s about time for us to go around the country by ourselves. That tour for today was more than enough. It helped me out a lot. Thank you very much. … If I meet your boss, I’ll tell him that you guided me the whole day.”
The guide looked up at Kino in surprise.
“It’s okay as long as he doesn’t find out, right?” Kino said with a smile.


The next day. That is, the morning of the third day since Kino had entered the country.
The weather was good as usual. When Kino asked, she was told that it’s like this the whole year round.
Kino replenished Hermes’ fuel, and after securing some food and water for herself, finished her departure preparations before noon.
In front of the hotel, the guide came with the rest of his family, and received each one’s parting words. She thanked the guide especially for what he had done the previous day.
The guide had his wife drive the children home. Then he turned to Kino and Hermes.
“There is one last important thing that I have to tell you. Please listen well,” the guide said with a serious expression more stern than anything he had put on up to this point.


From inside the gate, the guide, the hotel owners, and everyone else around who seemed to have free time gathered to send off the traveler. All the men had the same faces, and all the women had the same faces.
The guide spoke as everyone’s representative, “Miss Kino, Mister Hermes, thank you so much for spending time in our country. If you ever happen to pass nearby, please visit without any hesitation. At that time, it’s probably my children who will be welcoming you.”
“Thank you very much.”
“Thanks, stay well everyone.”
Watching Kino’s back as she passed through the gate, the guide took a deep breath.
“With this, I’m also done with my guide work…. I wonder if even fewer travelers will come.”
The hotel owner, upon hearing this, said to the guide in a somewhat surprised tone, “Don’t say things like that, and quickly head back to the town hall. Don’t you have a lot of work to do?”
“That is right. Things will be tough from here on. You took half the day off yesterday, correct? You shouldn’t be loafing around all the time! Now, back to work, back to work!” the owner’s wife chimed in.
The former guide who was unforgivingly scolded by his senior muttered weakly,
“Fine…”


“Yep, that was interesting. Truly interesting.”
“Uh-huh.”
Kino and Hermes chatted with one another while running through the wilderness path, the gate behind them.
“We should go back to that country again sometime.”
“Oh? It’s really rare for you to say something like that, Kino.”
The motorrad puffed up a cloud of dust without reserve.


Someone was peering at Kino and Hermes from a nearby place through a pair of binoculars. They dug a hole in the ground and covered it with a cloth of the same color.
“Okay! They’re confirmed to be safe!” he said happily.
“They’re pretty lucky, eh? Do you think they learned of the horrors of that country?” someone else beside him asked.
“That’s not important. Our job is to make sure there are no more victims,” the first person said in a slightly lively voice, and continued,
“Sergeant, contact headquarters. Tell them that we will be taking the traveler into custody.”


The motorrad ran along through the valley with the country, and climbed the hill that appeared before them.
When they reached the flat summit, they saw three humans. Kino suddenly hit the brakes and stopped.
The three men wore clothes the same color as the ground, and their faces were painted. Their clothes were so similar to the color of the ground that if they had been lying on the road, Kino would have mistakenly run over them.
The faces of all three were different. One of them extended an empty hand, and slowly approached Kino. Then he spoke, “Traveler, I am sorry to trouble you, but might you be able to come this way for a bit?”
“How come?” Kino asked. The man took another step closer, and saluted.
“I am a soldier from a country far to the south from here. From here on, my country will be performing a military operation. It is very dangerous to be here right now. Until things clear up, we would like you to wait for a while in a safe place.”
“If I refuse, you intend to take me by force, am I right?”
The soldier nodded to Kino’s question. “That is correct. We have been ordered to protect you, miss traveler, by all means.”
“I understand. Since I also intend to protect myself, I’ll do as you say.”
As Kino said this, one of the soldiers crouched on the ground, and lifted up a cloth. There was a hole, in which was hidden a small buggy.


On the slope of a hill opposite the country, from a place where the country was fairly visible, there was a big tent. A number of binoculars were installed; soldiers were peeking at the country in the valley through them.
Kino and Hermes were politely led to this place.
“We have company!”
“Good job.”
After the soldier saluted and left, a middle-aged man wearing a military uniform introduced himself to Kino.
“Hello, miss traveler and mister motorrad. I am the commander of all of the troops here. If our troops’ actions harmed an innocent traveler in any way, I apologize on my country’s behalf. This place is our frontline headquarters. As long as you are here, you will be safe. I’m terribly sorry, but you have to wait here for a while.”
“I see. By the way, what are you going to do from here on?”
At the same time as Kino asked this question, someone issued an order to depart from the wireless radio under the tent.
“I assure your safety, miss traveler. Prepare for the bombardment!”
“Bombardment?” Hermes asked, and the Commander answered.
“Yes. Starting now, our army will bombard that country in the opposite side of the valley. Please observe.”
He pointed at the slanting bottom of the hill, where a number of embankments were lined up. The soldiers took off all the covers, and a large number of artillery cannons were revealed.
The muzzles of the cannon slowly lifted up, and all of them pointed right towards the direction of the country.
The order was given in a hurry from the headquarters.
“All cannons, ready!” “Observation team, ready!” “Medic team, ready!”
“Once the bombarding begins, we can go out the hill and enjoy a good view. Well then, let’s go…,” the Commander said to Kino, and then he gave out the orders to his men.
“Commence attack!”
From the bottom of the valley resounded roars akin to lightning hitting a house next door. All of the cannons produced white smoke. The soldiers in the headquarters tent climbed up the hill. Kino also rode Hermes and climbed up.
From afar, a black flower bloomed at once above the skies of the country. The succeeding explosions produced smoke that looked like flowers. The sound of those explosions reached them after some delay.
The cannons from the back roared once more, and several flowers bloomed again. This was repeated several times.
All the while, the Commander who was watching beside Kino explained politely, “That shell fired just now would explode in the air, scattering minute fragments into the surrounding area. Then, all of the people outdoors and those inside not so sturdy structures will be successfully annihilated.”
“……”
Eventually the black bloom vanished, and from inside the wall, something exploded in a flash.
“That was a high-power explosive. It will destroy anyone inside solid structures. This is to make sure that everything’s done thoroughly.”
In the surrounding area, the sound of firing cannons, and the delayed impact of the projectiles mixed together, creating extremely noisy sounds.
Kino spoke to the Commander in a loud voice, “Even if I tell you to stop this bombardment, you won’t. Am I right?”
“That’s unreasonable. If we stop now, there’s the danger of a counter-attack.”
The Commander stopped at this point for a moment, as if he realized something. “Oh, I see. You must have forgotten something there, miss traveler. We will compensate you for it. We are truly sorry that an innocent person had to be involved in this matter.”
Kino shook her head. “No, thank you. It wasn’t something of extremely significant value.”
The Commander looked at Kino’s worried face.
“Two days before, we saw you enter that country. The truth is, the bombing was scheduled for yesterday noon, but we don’t want to involve innocents, so we waited,” the Commander said.
“I see…. Thanks, I’m truly grateful to you. By the way, can I at least hear the reason for the bombardment?”
“Why of course. That is a country where everyone had the same faces. We would like to erase that devil’s country from the face of this earth”
“Which means——” Kino tried to speak, but the violent volleys of cannon erased her voice. She spoke once more.
“Which means, one of you have entered that country?”
“Yes…. By chance, a group of travelers from our country went astray. And then, they saw that. People with the same faces, beings created from glass containers. They frantically escaped and returned home, and told us about this. But…”
“But?”
“Among those ten people, one committed suicide…. The rest received extreme mental shock. At least two were broken down in mind and body, and were admitted to hospital for medical treatment. It was really pitiful…”
“That’s why you have to make sure…”
“… To completely destroy it,” Hermes interrupted and spoke amidst the sound of firing cannons. From the country, something burning began to emit black smoke. The explosions continued.
“Yes, that’s right. So that the number of victims will not increase any further, and so that the devilish acts of that country not spread to ours or to other countries…. But miss traveler, for letting you enter and witness that, we were truly worried that you will come out as another victim. We’re really glad to see that you’re fine…”
“……”
“……”
Suddenly, the cannon roars died down. The last shell exploded, and the sound echoed lowly. And then it became quiet. Black smoke arose amidst the fragments in the interior of the walls, and was slowly carried away by the wind.
“Is it over?” Kino asked, and the Commander answered that the bombardment is over.
“The ‘bombardment’? Is there anything else?”
“Yes. Please look over there.”
The Commander pointed behind the row of cannons. There was an enormous shaft, like a factory chimney, on a push cart that was being pulled by a truck. It has a pointed tip, and a small wing-like protrusion was attached on its rear.
“A missile?” Hermes asked, and the Commander nodded.
“Now, we will fire that to the country. If even one person was left, they might increase in number again. To ensure that they are completely annihilated, we took the pains to develop a special bomb.”
“A special bomb?”
To Kino’s question, the Commander only suggested that she look and enjoy the view. He added, “Miss traveler. It would be a good idea to wear your goggles and bandana.”
The missile head slowly rose up. And then, the Commander brought down the order to fire.
From the jet propulsion at the rear, flames and smoke erupted, and a thunderous roar was heard at the same time as the shaft rose into the air.
The smoke left trails, and the missile flied out. And then it split into two in the air. Its rear fell feebly. The pointed end drew a parabola and dropped to the country in a gentle slope.
Just before it dropped, the tip split, and white smoke spread in an instant. The whole country was wrapped in a semi-spherical smoke as if a net was cast over it. In the next moment, the hemisphere transformed into huge balls of fire. The masses of flame covered everything, and were exhausted.
For several seconds, the thunderous roar and the shockwave reached the place where Kino and the others were. Dust soared violently, and for a while, nothing could be seen.
Plenty of time passed before the dust cloud was cleared away. Nothing was left of the place where the country had been, except for the scattered fragments of the wall which was blown to bits. Everything was flat. Up in the sky, a mushroom cloud, like one formed after a volcanic eruption, was leisurely ascending.
“We did it—!”
In the headquarters, the soldiers raised a cheer. They leaped happily and embraced each other.
“Wha—, amazing. That was the special bomb?” Hermes asked.
“Yes, that’s right. Everything worked out well.” The Commander showed a face of relief.
Kino pulled down her bandana and asked, ‘How does it work?’
“Did you see that white fluid which spread? That was fuel. It covered the entire country, and a little bit later, a bomb will set it aflame. And then, the surrounding oxygen will all be taken up and burned. The pressure will squish flat everything above ground. Furthermore, the heat will grill any living thing’s lungs. Not a single insect or animal will be left in there. It was a huge success,” the Commander said, and smiled as if he felt really good. He took off his dust-covered hat and brushed it off lightly.
“This is the end of this lengthy mission.”
He said calmly, and then took a photo from his breast. He looked at it, and his eyes narrowed.
“What is that?” Kino asked.
“My daughters.”
The Commander handed the photo to Kino with a smile.
It was the picture of two ten-year old girls, smiling, with exactly the same face.
“……”
Still silent, Kino showed the photo to Hermes, and then asked its owner a question.
“They’re twins?”
“Yes. Ireen and her younger sister, Meel.”
Kino spoke with a slightly worried tone, “I… can’t tell who’s who.”
The Commander was amused. “Hahaha. If you meet them, you’d be able to tell them apart immediately. The older sister is very spirited, while the younger one is really shy and withdrawn.”
“I see…,” Kino muttered, and returned the photo. The Commander looked at it slowly once more.
“Since this mission began, I haven’t seen them for more than six months. Now that the forces can safely pull out from this country, I’ll be able to see the two of them soon. Both of them must have grown very much…”
Kino spoke gently. “Once you go back to your country, the day you can hold them in your arms will be near. I’m sure you’re looking forward to it.”
“Thanks…. Miss traveler, you’re now safe. It took quite some time, but we truly are grateful for your cooperation. If you happen to come to the south, please drop by our country. At that time, my daughters will be welcoming you.”
Kino grinned, “Sounds great. Well then, we’ll be going.”


Kino and Hermes came out of the headquarters, and ran above the hill for a while.
As she stopped by the remains of the country, she spoke, “Everyone, please take care. Thank you for everything.”
“Yup. See ya!”
The motorrad climbed down the hill.
They passed by the smiling and waving soldiers beside the cannons, and eventually set off.


After several days, the cannons, which were no longer useful to the army, were scattered and buried underground. After confirming that they haven’t left any trash behind, the soldiers returned home with their trucks.
On the earth where the country formerly stood, only rubble and burnt remains were left.


Then, after fifty days have passed, the wind carried earth slowly to the ruins, and the color of the ground changed.
And then, one morning after fifty more days have passed.
From the earth of the ruins, rubble and dust was blown away, and the ground split open.
It was a rectangular concrete structure, as big as a house. There was a door, and it was open.
From inside, men with the same faces, and women with the same faces, came out in groups. They looked up in the sky; everyone had smiles on their faces.
The man who served as Kino’s guide came out together with his wife and children.
“Be careful of the rubble. Don’t fall over them.”
The man said to the children who were in high spirits.
“Wow, the sun after so long!”
“Look, everything’s destroyed——”
“Amazing. Everything’s flat and brand new.”
Freja, who was gripping his father’s hands, “Let’s play on the lawn again like before, okay?” She looked up at her father and asked.
“Of course. The forest will return to its original form, too. In the blink of an eye, at that.”
Freja grinned, and ran to her siblings who were walking ahead.
Someone with the same face came to the man’s side.
“Oh dear. They did a pretty good job wiping everything off clean. From here on, the town hall will be busy.” The man smiled bitterly.
“Yeah…. We will have less time for rest again.”
‘Hahahaha!’ the man beside him laughed heartily, and then spoke, “My condolences, your excellency. Perhaps this amount of work is too much for just one citizen. Maybe I should watch over you more.”
The guide, who apparently was the leader, shrugged his shoulders.
“Oh dear. I wouldn’t find a boss as strict as you anywhere else.”
“Hahahahahaha!” The other man left, laughing.


In the ruins, people flowed out of the exit. All men had the same face as one another. All women had the same as one another.
The guide-turned-leader looked around him, and said with a smile,
“If you have the will to survive, it is not that easy to perish.”
















"
5,v1c6,1,6,"“Oh my, how surprising… to meet someone in a place like this.”
So said a lone old woman who revealed herself from behind a thicket inside a deciduous forest. The old woman’s thin body was wrapped with an apron. She was carrying a basket with heaps of edible wild plants and mushrooms inside.
She was speaking to a young person. It was someone around mid-teens, with short, black hair, big eyes, and an intrepid expression on her face. She wore a black jacket fastened with a wide belt on her waist. Suspended from her right thigh was a holster for a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case a pistol). Inside it was a high-caliber revolver. Attached behind her waist was another automatic-type.
Parked right beside this person was a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly).
“Hello,” the person greeted.
“Hi there. You’re a traveler, aren’t you?” The old woman returned the greeting with a smile.
“Yes. I’m Kino, and this here is my partner, Hermes.”
The traveler whose name was Kino introduced the motorrad. The motorrad called Hermes returned a short ‘hello’, and proceeded to ask a question.
“Do you live near here, grandma?”
“Yes, that’s right. What about you two?”
Kino hesitated for a bit, and then asked the old woman,
“Is there a country around this area? We were aiming for that place, but we couldn’t find it. Are you a resident of that country, by any chance?”
The old woman shook her head. “A country, you say…? No, there’s none nearby. I’m sure you’ve lost your way somewhere. As for me, I live in a house inside this forest.”
“I see. There was a road up until here, though…,” Kino sighed.
“Yeah, but it seemed like an abandoned route. Why don’t we just give up?” Hermes suggested.
The old woman realized their circumstances, and asked Kino and Hermes with a lively voice, “Say, Miss Kino. Are you going to camp out here for today? It will be dark soon. If you like, I can let you stay in the house where I work for.”
“Work for?”
The old woman replied to Kino’s question. “Yes. I work as a maid in the house where I live in. I was gathering ingredients for dinner just now. The house is right there. What do you think?”
Kino asked Hermes’ opinion. As always, he just answered with ‘why not?’
“Okay. We’ll take you up on your offer,” Kino said.
“Oh, I’m glad. It’s the first time that we’ll be having guests,” she said happily.


They went inside the forest under the guidance of the old woman. After a while, a field in a forest clearing appeared. Beside it was a long and narrow livestock pen with chickens freely roaming about.
Beyond the fields, there was a single house.
Kino couldn’t help but knit her eyebrows upon seeing the house. It was a three-storey building sturdily made out of stone and bricks. It was much longer than it was wide, and doesn’t have a single window at the sides. It looked more like a downtown apartment, except that it stood alone in the middle of the forest. This house certainly didn’t belong to its surroundings.
“That’s the place?” Kino asked with a hint of doubt in her tone.
“Yes. Isn’t it wonderful?” the old woman answered.
Soon they made their way in front of the entrance, and the old woman turned to Kino and Hermes.
“Oh, right. First, I’ll have to inform you about something in advance.”
The old woman slowly placed her right hand on her chest, and spoke with a gentle smile, “I am a mechanical doll.”
“A mechanical doll?” Kino asked in surprise.
“That’s right. Even though I look exactly like a human, I am actually very different from you. This body was entirely made from wood, iron, and other things I don’t really know about. I am a mechanical doll created by humans for the sake of humans. My work is to do household chores for the humans residing in this house.”
“……. U-umm…” Kino faltered, while the old woman continued.
“Because this body is already old, I am already getting rickety in places, but I can still work.”
Hermes asked, “Ooh, you sure are well-made. Who created you, grandma?”
The old woman shook her head. “I was not given that kind of information. All I know is how to clean the house, do the laundry, cook meals, read stories to my young master before he goes to bed…”
“……”
“I see.”
Kino remained silent while Hermes voiced his admiration.
“Well, I’ll have to ask my master about you. I’m sure he would be fine with it, but for the meantime, please wait here.”
Kino spoke up at last when the woman vanished into the house.
“Impossible.”
“You bet. What are we going to do?”
“Well, it seems like we have no choice but to ask this ‘master’,” Kino muttered as the entrance opened.
Out came a man in his thirties, a woman of the same age who seemed to be his wife, and a five-year old boy shyly hiding behind the woman. They were all wearing elegant clothes.
After a while, the old woman made an introduction.
“Master, this is the traveler, Miss Kino and the motorrad, Mister Hermes. Miss Kino, these are my master, his wife, and their son.”
“Good afternoon,” Kino greeted. The ‘master’ slowly smiled and spoke.
“Good day, traveler and motorrad. We heard about your circumstances from granny. It seems like you’ve lost your way. We have plenty of vacant rooms, so please feel at home.”
The old woman seemed very happy. “Oh, I’m glad. That’s great, isn’t it? Now that it’s decided, I’ll be preparing the room for Miss Kino, so for the meantime, won’t you keep them company for a while, Master?”
“Yes, of course. Leave it to us. Please prepare dinner for one more person,” the man said.
“Now, please come in.”
Kino and Hermes were guided by the old woman and passed through a spacious living room.
The man read a newspaper while sitting on the sofa, while his wife and child played with an unfamiliar toy. They carried on happily with these activities.
The old woman bowed and left.
“Um, will you answer a question for me?” Kino asked, and the man looked at her.
“Of course. What is it?”
“It’s about that old lady…,” Kino spoke hesitantly, “Is what she’s saying the truth? That she’s a mechanical doll?”
The man nodded lightly. “Yes, that’s correct. That doll’s a hard worker and is a great help in the house. Thanks to that, my wife and I could work, and have more time for our family.”
“I see…. I have one more question.”
“What is it?”
“Is there a country around here?”
The man’s face became slightly troubled upon hearing this question. “No, there’s no country nearby. Miss traveler, it seems like you’ve lost your way…. This is a heavily wooded area, so that is not possible,” the man answered.
Kino asked in return, “Then, why are you living in this kind of place?”
“……”
The man did not say anything for a while.
And then he spoke with a smile, “No, there’s no country nearby. Miss traveler, it seems like you’ve lost your way…. This is a heavily wooded area, so that is not possible.”
“Is that so…”
After this, Kino said nothing more and waited quietly beside Hermes.
Eventually, they heard the return of the lively footsteps. The old woman announced with a smile, “Your room is ready. Please come this way.”
“Thank you very much… if you’ll excuse us.”
“Have a good time.”
Kino bowed lightly and pushed Hermes out of the reception room.
The man read the newspaper until the end.
Then started to read it from the beginning once more.


The room they were taken to was in the inner part of the first floor. It was rather spacious, with a painstakingly-made bed and other furniture which seemed to have history. Everything was wiped with a damp cloth so there was not a single speck of dust.
“You can stay here together with Mister Hermes. There’s a toilet and a shower inside. If you need anything, just ring the bell anytime. My room is right beside the entrance.”
Kino expressed her thanks. The old woman then left the room to prepare dinner.
Kino sat on the bed and removed her holstered persuader. Then she took off her jacket.
“Kino, what are we going to do?” Hermes asked.
“What to do…. To be frank, that family doesn’t seem like they want to associate with us.”
“That’s only natural.”
“Moreover, there are a lot of things they don’t want to tell us.”
“That’s also understandable.”
“Well, since grandma took pains to shelter us, let’s just accept her kindness and stay until tomorrow.”
“Understood.”


After taking a shower, Kino was called for dinner.
The family was sitting in silence in front of a splendid table in the dining room.
The woman moved nimbly on her own, lining up all of the dishes on the table from a food cart. There was fresh vegetable salad, consommé with mushrooms, a portion of steaming chicken served with finely chopped vegetables in olive oil sauce, and well-baked bread fresh from the oven with butter in a bowl.
“I hope you enjoy this old junk’s cooking. It’s a great honor for me,” the old woman bowed and went out of the room.
The man spoke to Kino, “Traveler, please help yourself.”
The family didn’t start eating the food, and just sat expressionlessly.
While observing the family, Kino slowly began to eat. After taking a bite, Kino’s meek expression became firm. Her pace quickened, and her face was full of satisfaction as she tasted all of the dishes.
When Kino has finished eating, the family silently stood up and moved to one side of the room carrying their plates. They moved aside a picture decorating the wall, revealing a small door. They opened it and threw away all of the food that they didn’t even touch inside the hole.
“……”
Kino was looking as they did this.
The old woman knocked and entered the dining room.
“How was it?”
“Yup. It was delicious. That chicken was the best.”
“It was great. Thank you, as always.”
“It was delicious——”
The family answered the old woman’s question without hesitation.
The old woman bowed with a smile, then turned to Kino. “Miss Kino, how was the food?”
“Eh? Yes, it was very delicious. I enjoyed it very much,” Kino said honestly.
“Oh, I’m glad,” the old woman said happily while laying down the plates with the desserts. And then she left.
Kino ate the dessert —raspberry sherbet— with delight.
The family remained silent and waited for Kino to finish eating, then tossed away the melted sherbet into the hole in the wall.
The man rang the bell and the old woman came.
“We’ll be excusing ourselves. Miss Kino, please have a relaxing stay,” the family said to Kino before they went out. The old woman happily removed the tableware and wiped the table clean.
Kino asked if there’s anything she could help with, but the old woman only shook her head and asked her instead, “Miss Kino, I’ll take something for you to drink before you sleep. Do you like hot chocolate?”
“Y-yes… thank you very much,” Kino said, and the old woman shook her head slowly once more.
“You don’t have to thank me,” and while narrowing her wrinkled eyes,
“It makes me feel great to be of use to somebody.”


“——so that’s how it is.”
“I see. But, they didn’t have to throw it away.”
“Yeah. I almost begged them to give it to me instead.”
“Where’s the family now?”
“It’s still seems a bit early in the evening. The old woman told me not to go to the second floor.”
“What do you think?”
“Well, it’s definitely not normal, but… without knowing the circumstances, I can’t really say anything.”
“Right. What about grandma?”
“She seemed busy so… I’ll just try to ask tomorrow. It’s been a long time since I have last slept on a bed.”
“Okay, good night——”


The next morning.
Kino woke up at dawn as usual. The weather was good. She moved her body lightly, then performed the maintenance of her persuaders.
When she went out to the corridor, she heard a sound from the kitchen. Kino peeked inside the slightly opened door and saw the old woman happily preparing breakfast. She rolled up fresh dough, and then molded it into shape. Then she coated it with melted butter and put it in the oven. She turned over a big hourglass.
Kino lightly knocked on the door.
“Good morning.”
“Oh my, Miss Kino. Good morning. It’s still too early. Did I wake you up, by any chance?”
“No, I always wake up this early. By the way, do you bake bread every morning?” Kino asked. The old woman answered as her hands continued to move.
“Yes. My most important job in the morning is to bake bread. Everyone eats lots of it, you see.”


The family woke up and sat at the dining table. The man and his wife were wearing business suits, while the son was carrying a small bag.
“Good morning. Miss Kino, were you able to rest well last night?” the man asked.
“Yes. It was all thanks to you,” Kino answered.
Baked bread, different kinds of jam, honey, soft-boiled eggs, salads, and crisply grilled bacon were lined up on the table.
“Traveler, please help yourself,” the man said. Without hesitation, Kino took as much as she could eat in her plate, and ate with much pleasure.
Just as the night before, the family only sat in silence. After some time, they threw away everything.
The man called for the old woman, who handed them two bags. And then, the three left the house.
The old woman returned to the dining room. When asked how the food was, Kino once again replied honestly.
“Without a doubt, this one is the best among the recent breakfasts that I had. It was much more delicious than any hotel’s or restaurant’s.”
“Why, thank you.”
“By the way, I have a question…,” Kino said, and the woman stopped and turned around.
“Yes?”
“Where is everybody going?”


“——My master and his wife goes to work. Their son goes to a nursery school. Every day, for five days a week.”
“Okay—. Grandma really said that?”
“Yeah. In any case, the couple works in different places, and since the husband is closer, he drops off and picks up the son from school. Well, it seems like they won’t be home until evening.”
“Ooh—. That’s something. Maybe you should have tried to ask where exactly they’re going.”
“… Oh well, what are we going to do?”
“Why don’t we leave? No one could answer your questions anyway.”
“Yup. I was thinking about that too, but let’s stay here a bit longer.”
“That’s fine, but why?”
“The reason’s a bit personal….”
“What?”
“Lunch——”


Kino took down the luggage from Hermes and pushed him outside. She was wearing her jacket.
Dried sheets were fluttering beside the entrance. The old woman was crouching by the field, doing something.
Kino stopped Hermes and approached the old woman.
“The potatoes are almost ready. During winter, everybody likes my gratin made from baking potatoes and bacon together in the oven. Maybe I could use some for this evening’s dinner.”
“That… also seems delicious,” Kino said.
“Good grief,” Hermes muttered with a small voice.
The old woman slowly stood up, looked at the sky, and searched for the sun. She looked at a particular point in the sky.
“Just perfect. Miss Kino, Mister Hermes, I want to show you something wonderful and rare. Please follow me,” she said to Kino whose face was a bit surprised.
And without waiting for Kino’s response, she walked briskly towards the forest. Kino pushed Hermes and followed in confusion.


Inside the forest, there was a path wide enough for one person to walk through. Kino followed the old woman while pushing Hermes along.
After a while, they arrived at a clearing and a scenery opened up before their eyes.
“Wow…”
“Amazing!”
Kino and Hermes exclaimed in wonder at the same time.
The place where the old woman finally stopped at was the cliff edge of an enormous valley. There was no ground right in front of them. The cliff has a steep angle, and was located at a tremendous height. The distance from the cliff to the other side of the valley was uniform.
When they carefully peeked at the bottom, they saw a lake. The long and narrow stretch of the lake had bright green water.
“This is amazing. It must be a valley formed by a glacier a long time ago,” Kino said.
“Who would have known there’s something like this nearby? It’s the end once you fall in. Be careful with your speed next time,” Hermes said.
Kino nodded in agreement and spoke to the old woman.
“So this beautiful view is what you wanted to show us.”
The old woman smiled and shook her head. “No. What I wanted to show you was something else.”
Kino made a dubious expression, while the old woman looked towards the sun once more.
“It’s about time. Please observe the bottom of the valley closely.”
Kino stopped Hermes by the cliff as much as she could, and then looked below.
The green of the lake slowly lightened up, as if it was being absorbed.
“?”
And then the lake became perfectly transparent, revealing the bottom of the valley.
“!”
“Kino! That’s!”
Kino gasped while Hermes exclaimed.
The bottom of the valley was illuminated by the bluish light passing through the water. It was a splendid city. There was a stretch of road networks lined up with a number of stone houses and apartments. More than half were crumbled remains of tall buildings and structures that looked like enormous factories, with holes opened on the roof. The city was enclosed with tall and thick walls built side by side.
“It’s a country…,” Kino muttered.
The woman spoke in a slow and gentle tone. “It’s a country from ancient times. It’s really sad; for some reason, this country was destroyed. Only during this time and season, the amount of light would make the water transparent and reveal this scenery.”
“……”
“……”
“I am sure there were a lot of people who lived here; people who lived supporting each other. But that was a long time ago.”
“……”
“……”
“What do you think? Isn’t it wonderful and rare to see an empty country appear like this?” the old woman asked the speechless Kino and Hermes.
Kino answered, her gaze still fixed at the bottom, “Yes…, I was totally surprised…. Thank you very much.”
“Oh, I’m glad. To think I can actually be a tour guide, too.”


When the old woman told them she has to return to work,
“I want to look at it a bit longer,” Kino said.
“I’ll go back and prepare lunch. Miss Kino, do you like wild rice soup?”
“Ah, yes. I’ve tried it in various countries before. I particularly like it with chicken.”
“That’s great. We’ll have that for lunch. Please come back when the sun is at its highest.”
And then the old woman left. Not long after, the water turned back to its original color.
“Kino, I thought you’ve noticed, but…”
Kino nodded. “Yeah. This country, or rather, its ruins, are relatively new….”
“Yup. No matter how you look at it, those buildings weren’t from ancient times.”
While Kino slowly drew Hermes away from the cliff,
“This may be the valley country that we were looking for…, no, it has to be.”
“Right. So, it was destroyed. The information must be outdated because you heard of it from a senile old man.”
“Even so, it’s strange that the old woman doesn’t know about it. It doesn’t seem like she was lying either…. And even if we ask the family, I doubt they’re going to tell us anyway.”
“Hide it or go and ask somebody else?” Hermes asked jokingly.
“Neither. We’ll leave this place tomorrow.”
“Ro—ger… wait, tomorrow? Ah! You wanted to freeload for dinner again.” As Hermes figured out the reason on his own,
“Well, my three days isn’t over yet,” Kino answered resolutely.


Kino ate lunch together with the old woman in the kitchen.
Kino ate the wild rice soup together with baked crackers enthusiastically.
On the other hand, the old woman only ate bread baked simply from some leftover dough and soup boiled from scrap vegetables.
“I always have this, so it has become my favorite,” she said.
As they were drinking their after meal tea, the woman talked proudly about the family.
The master was a very important person in the food company he works for, while the wife works very hard in a machine manufacturing company and sometimes comes home later than the husband. The young master does well in his studies and was popular at school.
The old woman told Kino how happy she was to work as a mechanical doll for this kind of family.
After a short break,
“Now, to make sure everyone has a nice home to return to, I have to do the cleaning,” the old woman said and quickly stood up. Right after, she pressed on her head, as if it throbbed painfully.
“Are you okay? Maybe you should rest for a bit,” Kino said, and tried to get the old woman to sit down.
“Yes, I’m fine. Maybe I need a little bit more grease? ——Well, it’s time to clean,” the old woman said with a smile and slowly stood up. She put the tableware in the sink and went out of the kitchen.


“It’s a good opportunity to stay for one more night.”
“Oh dear. And then?”
Kino was in front of the entrance, doing Hermes’ maintenance. She was tightening up screws and bolts on various parts, and applying grease where it was needed. Afterwards, she polished his headlights and tank.
“There, it’s perfect,” Kino said as she finished wiping everything.
“It’s not ‘perfect’, Kino. My speedometer’s still broken,” Hermes complained.
“I know how you feel, but fixing a speedometer is beyond me. We’ll have to go to a watchmaker for that,” Kino said, and Hermes sighed.
“Sigh…. I’ll have to endure this for a while.”


Kino pushed Hermes and returned to the room. They were just in time to see the old woman cleaning and putting the bed in order.
“Oh, I see Mister Hermes has also become clean.”
“Thanks. But you see——” Hermes complained and explained his dilemma. Then the old woman spoke in a casual tone,
“Can I take a look at the problem?”
“Eh?”
“Huh?”
“I’m used to detailed work, you see. Besides I’m a mechanical doll, so… Anyway, wait here for a bit, my master should have tools here somewhere.”
Then the old woman went out of the room and came back holding tools.
“Um, well, for the time being… If it’s no good, then it’s fine, so…”
As Hermes said this, the old woman disassembled the speedometer and examined the numerous tiny gears inside. And then,
“Ah, a gear was out of place,” she said without a care. Hermes expressed his wonder,
“Amazing!”
“… Uh, can you fix it?” Kino asked. The old woman moved around a pair of tweezers like an expert watchmaker. And then,
“There. I think that should do it,” she said immediately and put together the disassembled parts.
“Let’s try it, Kino.” Kino pushed Hermes. The meter worked without a cinch.
“……”
Kino said nothing, and looked at the old woman.
“Wow! Amazing! Grandma, thank you so much!” Hermes said in high spirits.
“I somehow managed to do it. I’m really glad to be of help,” the old woman said in a very satisfied tone.
“Now then, I’ll have to make preparations for dinner.”


“——I still couldn’t believe what we have seen today.”
“But she fixed it perfectly. Ah, I feel so refreshed.”
“I wonder who she really is, that old woman.”
“Who knows? What if she really is a mechanical doll? Then things would make sense.”
“Impossible.”
“Impossible, it is. But,”
“But what?”
“It doesn’t sound like a good thing to say, but she really is one useful person.”
“Yeah——”


During dinner, Kino cleaned up her plate while the family threw everything away, as usual.
Kino asked about the country at the bottom of the lake. However,
“Too bad, but we don’t know anything about it because it’s so old,” was the only answer given to her.
Kino then told them that she’ll definitely be leaving by tomorrow, and thanked them for everything.
“I see. Tomorrow huh…,” the man mumbled.


The next day, that is, the morning of the third day since Kino arrived in this house.
Kino woke up at dawn. She did her light exercises and went outside. The sky was so clear it was almost transparent.
Kino went to the kitchen, but the old woman was not there. She was not in the dining or the living room either.
She went to the old woman’s room and opened the door slightly. Kino peeked inside.
The old woman was collapsed on the floor right before the door.
“!”
Kino rushed to her and slowly raised her up. The old woman’s eyes were closed, and she was letting out long and thin gasps of air.
Kino raised the old woman and laid her on the bed.
“Grandma, can you hear me?”
The old woman opened her eyes slightly. “Oh…, Miss Kino.”
“I found you collapsed in front of your door. Are you aware of your body’s condition?” Kino asked, and the woman answered.
“Yes…, I know it all so well…. It seems like it’s time for this machine to break down…. Please, Miss Kino. I have to say goodbye to them. Will you take me to where everybody is…?”
“No, I’ll call them. You are in no condition to be moved around. I’ll come back right away!” Kino said, turned on her heels and opened the door of the room. There were three people standing in the corridor.
“!”
The family entered the room without saying anything.
Kino gaped at them for a while and then ran back to her own room and tapped Hermes awake.
She came back to the room pushing Hermes along. The three where standing beside the bed, looking down at the old woman quietly. Kino set Hermes on his center stand behind them.
The old woman spoke in a small voice. “Everyone… everyone…”
“Yes.”
“Yes.”
“Yes.”
The three replied one after the other.
The old woman slowly opened her eyes. And while looking at the vacant space between the husband and the wife, she asked,
“Have I… been of use… to all of you…?”
“Yes.”
“Yes.”
“Yup.”
The man, his wife, and their son said as they nodded.
The old woman smiled very slowly.
“Oh, that’s good… to know…,” she muttered weakly.
Slowly, she exhaled quietly and lengthily, and closed her eyes.
And stopped moving.


Kino placed her fingers on the old woman’s throat. The three only stood quietly.
“She has passed away,” Kino said.
“Yes,” the man replied.
“She was a human after all?” Kino asked in confirmation, and the man turned to Kino.
“Yes,” was all he said, with a sad expression on his face.
“Well, I don’t believe mechanical dolls could really exist anyway,” Hermes said.
“What are you planning to do now?”
The man answered Kino’s question,
“We’ll bury her. You can help if you like.”


Kino and the others wrapped the old woman’s body in sheets.
Afterwards, the man took the hourglass from the kitchen and laid it side by side with the hands of the old woman folded on top of her chest.


“Please follow me,” the man said. Together with his wife, they got the body out of the house on a stretcher. The son had a big rucksack on his back, and carried four shovels in his hand with ease.
Inside the deciduous forest, there was a path wide enough for one person to walk through. Kino followed the old woman while pushing Hermes along.
After a while, they arrived at a clearing and a scenery opened up before their eyes. The morning sun shined on the magnificent valley. The light shined diagonally on the green water of the lake.
They laid the body down and started to dig a hole near the cliff, in a place where the lake could be seen very well. Kino followed suit.
When the grave was ready, the man took the corpse in his arms, entered the hole, and gently laid it down. The son opened the rucksack and took out a human skull from inside.
It was a slightly yellowed skull of an adult. Its left side was violently broken. The man placed it carefully beside the old woman’s head. Then the son took out another, smaller skull. This time, it was a child’s. The man put it beside the old woman’s head as well.
The man turned to Kino and spoke, “Her husband and son.”
The man went out of the hole, handed out the shovels, and started to dump soil on the grave. The wife and the son proceeded silently.
Kino also began to work on the other side.
For a while, only the cries of birds, the leaves rustling from the wind, and the sound of earth filling up a hole, could be heard.


Kino stood in front of the fresh grave, opening her eyes from a long, silent prayer. Her mouth moved a little, but no voice came out.
Kino turned to the family. “We’ll have to excuse ourselves now. Thank you for letting us stay.”
The man smiled lightly and opened his mouth to speak.
“Miss Kino, don’t you want to know?”
“Know what?”
“As to ‘who’ she was, ‘what’ we are, and ‘where’ that place at the bottom of the lake belonged to.”
“……”
Kino fell silent for a moment.
“What do you say? We can answer all of your questions, Miss Kino,” the wife smiled a little, and spoke with a clear voice.
“… I would love to know,” Kino said.
“Me too!” Hermes chimed in happily.
The son’s eyes brightened up, and with a vivid expression,
“It’s going to be a rather long story. Is that all right with you, Miss Kino?” he said with the tone of an adult.
“Y-yes…, I don’t mind,” Kino said, slightly surprised.
The man, woman, and child, looked at each other and smiled.
“But first, look at this,” the man said as he placed both of his hands on the son’s head. He turned it twice to the left, and lifted it from the rest of the body.
“!”
Kino’s face convulsed for a moment. The son’s laughing head was connected to its body with a number of thin tubes.
“D-don’t tell me… everyone’s…”
“Yes,” the wife said. And then with her right hand, she removed her left, and let it dangle. The man replaced the son’s head, and removed his own.
“Mechanical dolls?”
The man answered Kino’s question by making his head nod with his hands.
Kino exhaled deeply, her eyes still wide open.
“Wow, I’m surprised! But you sure are well-made!” Hermes said happily.


Kino sat beside Hermes, who was set on his center stand.
“Now that I know ‘what’ you are, kindly tell me ‘who’ she was and ‘where’ that city belonged. And if you can, please tell me ‘why’, as well.”
“I understand. Let us explain first about that country,” said the male mechanical doll who remained standing.
“You must have heard rumors about a rare country in the middle of a long and narrow valley…, but you weren’t aware that it was an extinct country torn between two races which were in constant struggle against each other,” said the female mechanical doll who remained standing.
“At times, political confrontations would result in bloodshed. Even so, people lived in it, either from the illusion that things would stabilize someday, or from the reality that they have no other place they could go to,” said the child mechanical doll who remained standing.
“She was born and raised in such a country. Miss Kino, do you want to know her name?”
Kino shook her head in response to the three people who stiffly stood, lined up near the edge of the cliff.
“Fifty years ago, she was a doctor of mechanical engineering in that country. She was thirty years old at the time. In that world, she was known as ‘a genius that comes only once in several hundred years’,” said the male mechanical doll.
“So that’s why she was able to fix Hermes.”
“I see.”
Kino and Hermes muttered.
“Yes. If it’s her, she could probably make all of the parts of a motorrad by herself. Even the parts a hundred times smaller inside the engine; she can make them move perfectly,” said the female mechanical doll.
“……”
“Wow.”
“She became unsatisfied with the research sponsorship she received and decided to build her own research facility. Her aim was to create mechanical dolls. Machines which looked exactly like humans, that work for humans, are yet to be created——,” said the child mechanical doll.
“She thought, ‘Mechanical dolls will free humans from work. And as a result, everyone will have spare time to resolve their differences; then the quarrels thus far will all be a thing of the past,’” said the male mechanical doll.
“She immersed herself into her research. But even with her abilities, creating mechanical dolls of the quality she desired was no simple task. She spent days on end in her research facility, and had very little time to spend with her beloved husband and son. We witnessed this while we were inside our cases,” said the female mechanical doll.
“From time to time, she would look sadly at the picture of her family. Even so, she carried on with her research. And finally, her efforts bore fruit when she completed three mechanical dolls that function perfectly,” said the child mechanical doll.
“I see.”
“That’s the three of you.”
The male mechanical doll confirmed. After that, he continued hesitantly.
“She embraced us happily. She put us in her car in a hurry, and took us to her apartment, to the place where the people whom she wanted to share the success of her research before anyone else, waited. ‘They’ll be surprised. I managed to finish just in time,’ she said happily…. But when we arrived, the apartment was no longer there. In its place was a mountain of rubble, the traces of a big explosion. It was a terrorist bombing born from the feud of the two opposing races.”
“……”
“……”
The female mechanical doll narrowed her eyes and continued. “She jumped out of the car and ran to the mountain of debris. She looked at the corpses lined up beside it and found her husband, with part of his head crushed, and her son, whose lower body was missing. Then, she turned to us and laughed, ‘Now, everyone. My husband and son are waiting. Let’s celebrate!” ——She went inside the apartment without a moment’s delay. The rubble collapsed on her. We saved her and took her to the research facility to treat her injuries. Her life was out of danger, but it took several days for her consciousness to return. However, she was not the same person who created us….”
The child mechanical doll continued, his face having the expression of someone who was about to cry.
“When she regained consciousness, the first thing she told me was, ‘What time is it?’ I answered promptly, and she reacted with, ‘Oh, my. Master’s going to be home soon. I have to make dinner.’ She then tried to get up with her injured body. We immediately gave her a shot of tranquilizer. But when she opened her eyes for the second time, she asked us, ‘Are you the family that I serve?’ She asked a number of times, until finally, we responded, ‘Yes, that’s right. But right now, you are still in the middle of production. So you have to wait for a while.’ ——No matter how much we tried to fix her and examine every nook and cranny of her brain, we couldn’t find out how she became like this. If only she were a mechanical doll, we could pinpoint the exact place with the problem.”
“… And then, what happened?” Kino asked.
The male mechanical doll looked at the other two mechanical dolls, and spoke as their representative.
“And then, while we were waiting for her to recover physically, the fighting between the two sides escalated. Every day, there would be terrorist bombings, and the other side would retaliate in a similar fashion. We felt that her body would soon be in danger, so we hid her in the basement of her research laboratory. An ugly civil war soon broke out. Eventually, the deafening days which continued on end suddenly came to a halt. The population had decreased rapidly to the point that it could no longer continue as a country. After a while, groups emerged, living however they wanted and going around killing for food. In the end, everyone left the country. We have no idea about their whereabouts, but seeing that there were no rumors that the country was no longer in existence, probably…”
“I see,” Kino nodded.
“We took her with us above ground. She said with a smile, ‘My, how chaotic. It would be really worthwhile cleaning this place up.’ And so we told her, ‘No, we will be moving to a new house. Inside the forest above the valley, there’s a really inexpensive place we could live in. There, you will work for us.’ ——Since then, for 54 years and 341 days, we have been acting as an artificial family for her.”
“I see…,” Kino said.
“What about that lake?” Hermes asked.
“To prevent her from recollecting painful memories, we built a dam and submerged the country. The water becoming transparent was not part of our calculations.”
“Did you know that her body was getting weaker?”
The mechanical dolls answered Kino’s question.
“Yes. We performed a regular scan of her body’s condition…. But old age was the only thing we couldn’t do anything about.


When everything had been explained, Kino faced the mechanical dolls.
“I don’t have anything else I would like to ask. We’ll pack up and leave.”
At that moment, the three mechanical dolls spoke all at once.
“We were made by her. To work for the sake of humans, yes, to work for her. And so, our mission has come to an end…. But, that was not our only duty! Miss Kino, is there anything you want us to do for you? Just say it. If we don’t do anything for humans, then there is no reason for us to exist! Just continuing to exist will be very painful!”
Kino answered, “No, there’s nothing.”
“Please don’t say such things! There must be something! We can be of assistance to you. We can be someone you need. We can be your friends, parents, children, lovers, or enemies.”
“……. I am not interested. I’m sorry,” Kino answered expressionlessly, just as before.
“Don’t you have someone you truly need from the bottom of your heart?” asked a monotonous voice.
“Right now, there’s no one. Well, except for myself.”
“No way! Not having a person important to you, isn’t that sad? Isn’t that sort of life empty? Humans have to be together with someone. Humans have to live for somebody. If not, wouldn’t that be really painful?”
Kino shook her head. “It depends,” answered a monotonous voice.
“Please make use of us!”
Kino shook her head once more.
Then they asked, “We can’t be of any use to you? We are useless?”
Kino remained silent.
Eventually, they muttered, “Is that so…”
They turned on their heels and slowly walked. Soon the footsteps vanished, and they disappeared from Kino’s sight.
After some time, the sound of something hitting the water was heard.
Kino peeked below the cliff.
The three were floating face up on the green water.
The lake slowly cleared up. At the same time, the bodies began to sink.
They sank towards the blue city; their arms wide open as if they were about to fly.




"
6,v2c1,2,1,"The road was divided into two.
One climbs up a hill, continuing towards a forested highland in the north.
One goes down south, extending towards the ocean which can be seen as blue from a distance.
“Now, Kino. Which way do we go?” said a stationary motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly). The motorrad’s rear wheel was packed on top and on both sides with traveling luggage.
Standing beside him, the human called Kino muttered, “Now that you mention it…”
She was around mid-teens in age, had short black hair and an intrepid expression on her face. Goggles were dangling from her neck, and she was holding a brown coat in her hands.
She was wearing a black jacket with a wide belt fastened on her waist. Suspended on her right thigh was a holster for a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol), and another automatic-type was attached behind her waist.
Kino turned and looked behind her. There was the towering interior of the walls and the now closed gates.
The wall disappears into an endless stretch of mountains to the north, and likewise fades into the continuously extending downward slope to the south. The enclosing walls cannot be seen. One would wonder whether the place was really inside a country or not.
“Phew…. This is such a big country. I want a map,” Kino said while rolling her coat.
“For the meantime, why don’t we go towards the sea, Hermes? I have no reason in particular, but there might be someone over there.”
Kino asked, and the motorrad called Hermes replied, “That’s fine with me.”
Kino tied the coat to the carrier and started Hermes’ engine. She wore her hat, strapped her goggles on and slowly went down the road heading to the sea.
After some time descending down the hill, the coastline and the town came into view at the tip of the slope.
A hovee (Note: ‘Hover vehicle’. A floating vehicle) [1] came flying from below. Several men were aboard its deck. It made a sudden steep turn, lowered its altitude, and moved side by side with Kino and Hermes.
“Are you a traveler?” A man called out with a loud voice from the platform. Kino nodded, and the man happily made an exaggerated gesture, pointing towards the city at the end of the road.
“Welcome! Please follow the road to reach our place over there!”
Kino nodded several times and raised her left thumb. The men on the hovee waved their hands, then the hovee accelerated and went ahead.
Kino and Hermes entered the coastal town. On the left side, there was a dike made to protect against the waves on the beach, and the round expanse of the sparkling blue ocean. The white houses made of stone were lined up along the slope facing the ocean. Several people who caught sight of Kino and Hermes waved their hands from their windows.
The people gathered in a square by the harbor. Kino stopped Hermes as she was invited to come in.
“Welcome, rare traveler!” An old man who seemed to be the chief greeted Kino.
“Hello. I am Kino, and this here is my partner, Hermes.” Kino removed her hat and greeted back. Hermes also said ‘hello’.
The old man introduced himself as the chief. He invited Kino to a roofed bench where they could sit together. She parked Hermes on his stand beside her.
Everyone observed as the chief welcomed the rare visitor to the town and offered her lodgings and meals for free. Kino thanked him.
‘There’s something I would like to ask,’ Kino told him, and she proceeded to ask as to why there was no map in the fully automatic gates, and the reason why the road was divided.
The chief’s expression darkened a little.
“The truth is…, right now this country is divided into two: the coastal part and the highlands to the north.”
“Why is that?” Hermes asked.
“Well…, differences in opinion I suppose. The country is so wide, and we almost broke off. But the truth is that we just can’t get in friendly terms with each other. Oh, it’s so embarrassing.”
And then the chief suddenly asked Kino, “By the way, are you picky with food?”
“Huh?”
“I’m asking if there’s a particular food or cuisine Miss Kino would never eat?”
Kino thought for a while, and then she shook her head and said no.
“Or one that your body rejects?”
“Nothing in particular.”
The chief grinned, “That’s great. It’s our custom to prepare unusual and luxurious dishes, but…”
As if on cue, the people surrounded Kino and made inviting gestures. Everyone had excited eyes, as if in anticipation of something. The chief continued.
“Whenever there is something for us to celebrate, it is our custom to make extravagant meals together with everyone. For instance, to have a rare visitor like you, Miss Kino, is such an exciting event——”
Kino understood the intention of the people, and nodded.
“——We thank you for preparing us a welcoming celebration. Everyone,”
Upon hearing this, the eyes of the surrounding people glittered.
“I see,” the chief said with a comfortable and solemn expression.
Kino stood up. She looked around the people surrounding her, and faced the chief.
“Well, I think it’s worth a try.”
Everybody raised a cheer.


Kino and Hermes were guided into a room with a good view of the sea.
They came to the room that the chief used after taking down the luggage off Hermes. They were invited to a hunting tour. The hovee will go out to sea, and while in an honorary seat, they will be entertained with a view of large prey.
Kino thought it was interesting and readily agreed, and asked Hermes what to do.
“We’re free anyway,” Hermes said. Kino pushed Hermes along and went out of the room.
Several hovees were lined up on the harbor. Kino went aboard a hovee with Hermes.
The group of hovees floated lowly, and soared towards the clear and calm sea. The hovee Kino and Hermes were riding followed into the air.
“Anyhow, the prey will be large. It will be an exciting hunt,” the young man who was hired to be their guide said happily.
They looked down and saw the men taking out something from the crates on the deck. Those were long and narrow tubes the length of a child. They gripped the tubes and placed them on their padded shoulders. At one end, there was a thick, cone-like protrusion attached.
“Those are tools which fire off gunpowder from the explosive-filled tips. They were called ‘rockets’ or something. It seems that they were used in wars a long, long time ago to destroy vehicles and hard objects.”
“Those will be used in the hunt?” Kino asked.
“Yes, that’s right. Those are important for catching the prey,” the guide answered with a laugh. At that moment, a voice came from the driver’s seat.
“There it is! To the left!” He pointed to the sea surface, where a fountain of water sprayed up.
The hovees scattered and approached, surrounding the fountain of water. The hovee where Kino and Hermes was riding on slightly advanced. A person leaned over from the deck and waved a flag to indicate directions.
A big black shadow appeared and stirred under the sea surface directly below the hovee Kino was riding.
It was an enormous creature. It was thick and streamlined. Its huge tail fin quietly went up and down, slowly propelling it forward. From tip to tail, it was several times the length of a hovee.
“It’s big,” Kino murmured.
“It’s a whale. It is the largest creature in the oceans. Is this your first time seeing one?”
“Yes. I only read about it in books. Even so, it’s really big.”
“So in a place like this, you can do some ‘whale sightseeing’, eh?” Hermes said.
“Ah, no no. The show is just getting started. ——We will hunt that.”
The hovees approached it on both sides and dropped something on the sides of the whale. They dropped several pieces of cylinders the size of small packets one at a time.
The packets exploded underwater. Water columns rose in succession on both sides of the whale. The muffled explosions echoed.
The huge form of the whale twisted. As if in a rampage, its tail struck the sea surface loudly, and lifted its head high.
At that moment, rockets were launched from the hovee which passed right above it.
Whoosh—!
The rockets left a white trail of smoke, and hit the head of the whale as it emerged from the water.
Its head exploded.
Mixed flesh and blood scattered and fell loudly onto the water surface.
In a moment, the whale’s huge form squirmed, making waves on the surface. Then it stopped moving. It stopped living. The deep red seawater began to engulf its body.
“Great—!”
The guide and everyone on board the hovees raised a cheer.
A number of people holding ropes jumped off. They tied the whale’s tail to several hovees.
They dragged it to shore while the bulky corpse left a trail of blood.
The headless whale was raised on the slope for lowering ships beside the square. Cheers rose from the people who were preparing the venue.
They began to take apart the body of the whale. They hauled a gigantic saw using a hovee. Soon, the harbor was stained dark with the spilled blood.
It was carved into big blocks and the blocks were carried by truck to the square. Then several people cut them to smaller pieces.
After they finished cutting the meat, it was divided into three portions. The chief explained to Kino.
“The ones placed beside the tent are for today’s feast. Those in the trucks will be stored for future use. And then,”
The chief pointed to the meat, bones and pieces of entrails piled high on top of a big sheet. Upon closer inspection, those were also parts meant for consumption.
“Those are everybody else’s share.”
“Who do you mean by ‘everybody else’?” Kino asked.
“Our comrades, but they’re not here right now. I’ll introduce them later,” said the chief, grinning.
“——Now, everyone let’s eat.”
With the chief’s introduction, the people filled the square and started the banquet.
A plate was passed to Kino who was sitting nearby. Young women and rough-looking men in aprons were busy working. The chief told her that this country had good dishes, and above all, attractive people.
“Now, please have some too, Miss Kino,” the chief urged her.
A big shrimp was placed in one big platter. Its torso was gaping open, and sliced raw flesh was placed inside. The head and feet of the dying shrimp moved and twitched from time to time, as if recalling something.
Placed in another plate was a fish with only its head, backbone, and tail fin, with its beaten and minced body placed beside. Its mouth and gills, in which water will never pass again, opened and closed.
Live shrimp and shellfish were placed on top of a charcoal oven. These writhed for a while, before they emitted bubbles and died.
Steaks were carried in — it was the meat of the whale earlier. It seemed delicious as it was not too burnt, but blood accumulated on the dish.
“……”
Kino gazed at these for a while.


“Good grief,” Hermes said.
In her room, Kino was lying face up on her bed wearing a shirt. She let out a breath, and then spoke.
“Ah, that was delicious…”
“That was disgusting. You don’t have to eat ‘til you drop,” Hermes said, appalled. 
Kino spoke while looking at the ceiling.
“If you wish to be a traveler, you should be able to eat when it is time to eat. Someone wrote that in a book.”
“Yuck”
Outside the room, the sun has almost completely gone down, and the color of the sky has begun to change. The sound of chairs and tables being cleaned up can be heard from the square.
“Miss Kino. Are you awake?” A voice was heard as someone knocked on the door.
“Message from the chief. We will be dividing the share with our comrades. Would you like to watch?”


The evening sun was shining golden on the sea. Two hovees were flying on the sea surface.
Kino, Hermes, the chief and a few others were riding in one of the hovees. Meanwhile, something was suspended from the other hovee. At the end of the rope the sheets containing the pieces of whale meat were wrapped together.
The hovee stopped a good distance from the coast.
The chief stood on the deck.
“Please accept this,” he said in a short message. He lowered his hands lightly.
The rope on one side of the sheet disconnected, and the contents fell. The dead flesh scattered on the water. Soon, fish gathered in the place. A variety of fish, small and large, rushed and disturbed the surface of the water. Sea birds drifted overhead.
“Our comrades,” the chief said.
“In nature, other creatures serve as food for other living things, just like us.”
While looking leisurely below, “So, this is their share, eh?” Kino said approvingly.
The chief also looked below leisurely.
“Yes, they were raised eating other creatures, and in turn, get eaten by other creatures. In this ocean, our comrades live in great numbers, but never too many nor too few. Usually, we only take them during times of celebration.”
“I see…,” Kino said, and slowly leaned on the edge of the deck. She looked at the sky to the west. The orange lump will soon be touching the horizon.
They parted with their comrades, and the hovee set on its homeward journey while casting its long shadow on the sea.


Evening. Kino was invited to have tea with the elders.
‘What are you planning to do tomorrow?’ asked the chief, to which Kino informed them of her intention to visit the highlands to the north.
And then the elders who were drinking tea suddenly exclaimed together.
“You’d better stop!”
Kino asked them if there’s something dangerous up there, but they only shook their heads. The chief spoke.
“Well no, I don’t think that’s the case. It’s just that…”
The chief made a sad face.
“Those people are very cruel. They’re totally incompatible with us.”
“Cruel, you say?” Kino asked, and the chief slowly nodded and spoke.
“However, I don’t think it’s a bad idea to see for yourself, Miss Kino, the cruelty and ugliness of those people.”


The next morning, Kino got up at dawn.
As usual, she performed her body exercises, and trained with and carried out the maintenance of her persuaders.
Kino was treated to a lavish breakfast in the chief’s home. In addition, she received a present of dried fish. Kino thanked them politely.
Kino rode up the path she went through the day before. She passed in front of the eastern gates.
After climbing up the hill for a while, the town amidst the dense forests came into sight at the end of the slope. Like the day before, a hovee glided beside them.
“Are you a traveler?” a man on the platform asked.
Kino and Hermes entered the town in front of the forest. On the right side, the forest with its bright leaves has spread and engulfed the white stone houses lined up on the slopes. Several people who caught sight of Kino and Hermes waved their hands from their windows.
The people gathered in a square around a wooden tower. Kino stopped Hermes as she was invited to come in. She exchanged greetings with the chief.
Everyone observed as the chief welcomed the rare visitor to the town and offered her lodgings and meals for free. Kino thanked him.
And then the chief suddenly asked Kino. “By the way, are you picky with food?”
“No. There’s no particular food my stomach rejects. Also, I do not hate stuff served in feasts,” Kino said immediately. The eyes of the residents glittered.
“Oh dear,” Hermes muttered out of earshot.
For the welcoming feast, they will set off to hunt a creature. Kino was asked if she would like to watch.
So came the invitation, to which Kino readily agreed. She asked Hermes what to do,
“We’re free after all,” answered Hermes. Kino pushed him along and went aboard a hovee.
The group of hovees floated lowly, and glided into the forest. The hovee Kino and Hermes were riding followed to the air.
“Anyhow, the prey will be large. It will be an exciting hunt,” the young man who was hired to be their guide said happily.
Below, on the hovee’s deck, the men were assembling rockets similar as yesterday’s.
And suddenly a voice came from the driver’s seat.
“There it is! To the right!” He pointed in between the trees, where something moved.
The hovees scattered and approached, surrounding the tree. The hovee where Kino and Hermes was riding on slightly advanced. A person leaned over from the deck and waved a flag to indicate directions.
A big black shadow moved on the ground directly below the hovee where Kino was riding.
It was an enormous creature. An elongated nose protruded from its stone-like body. Its big ears shook, and its four fat legs slowly moved forward. From the tip of its extended nose up to its tail, it was twice as long as the hovee.
“It’s big,” Kino murmured.
“It’s an elephant. It is the largest creature in the forests. Is this your first time seeing one?”
“Yes. I only read about it in books. Even so, it’s really big.”
“So in a place like this, rest omitted,” Hermes said in a small voice. [2]
“Well, the show is just getting started. ——We will hunt that.”
The hovees approached it from both sides and dropped something on the sides of the elephant. They dropped several pieces of cylinders the size of small packets one at a time.
The packets exploded on the ground. The ground was hollowed out, and soil rose up in succession on both sides of the elephant. The muffled explosions echoed.
The huge form of the elephant trembled. As if in a rampage, the elephant’s footsteps resounded loudly as it fled. It ran towards the narrow spaces between the trees.
At that moment rockets were launched from the hovee which passed right beside it.
Whoosh—!
The rockets left a white trail of smoke, and hit the head of the elephant as it emerged from behind a tree.
Its head exploded.
Mixed flesh and blood scattered and fell on the ground with a wet sound.
In a moment, the elephant’s huge form squirmed and hoisted its body in a straight position. Then it collapsed to the side, creating a tremor in the ground. Then it stopped moving. It stopped living. The deep red blood began to stain the ground.
“Great—!”
The guide and everyone on board the hovees raised a cheer.
A number of people holding ropes jumped down. Then they tied the elephant’s limbs to several hovees.
They carried it in the air while the bulky corpse dripped blood along the way.
The headless elephant was raised onto the space near a fountain beside the square. Cheers rose from the people who were preparing the venue.
They began to take apart the body of the elephant. They hauled a large saw using a truck. Soon, the cobblestoned ground was stained dark with the spilled blood.
It was carved into big blocks and then several people carried them to the square and cut them to smaller pieces.
After they finished cutting the meat, it was divided into three portions. The chief explained to Kino.
“The ones placed beside the tent are for today’s feast. Those in the trucks will be stored for future use. And then,”
The chief pointed to the meat, bones and pieces of entrails piled high on top of a big sheet. Upon closer inspection, those were also parts meant for consumption.
“Those are everybody else’s share.”
“‘Everybody else’?” Kino asked.
“They’re not here right now. I’ll introduce them later,” said the chief, grinning.
“——Now, everyone let’s eat.”
With the chief’s introduction, the people filled the square and started the banquet.
A plate was passed to Kino who was sitting nearby. Young women and rough-looking men in aprons were busy working. The chief told her that this country had good dishes, and above all, attractive people.
“Now, please have some too, Miss Kino,” the chief urged her.
A grilled monkey was placed in one big platter. Its torso was gaping open, and chopped herbs were placed inside. Its legs were pointing towards the sky — it almost looked like a human baby.
Placed in another plate was the boiled head of a sheep with its brain exposed. Its clouded eyes, in which light will never pass again, were scooped out and served as a side dish.
A number of live chicken were carried beside the square. The necks were placed and fixed between two bars, and were immediately cut off with a small axe. The headless bodies bolted, ran about the place for a while, and died. The chief said that they will be fried and eaten later.
Steaks were carried in — it was the meat of the elephant earlier. It seemed delicious as it was not too burnt, but blood accumulated on the dish.
“……”
Kino gazed at these for a while.


“Two days in a row,” Hermes said.
In her room, Kino was lying face up on her bed wearing a shirt. She let out a breath, and then spoke.
“Ah, that was delicious…”
“You sure feel great,” Hermes said with a hint of sharpness in his tone.
Kino remained lying on the bed.
“It’s not bad to see a country like this from time to time…. Even so, I didn’t know that sheep brains were so soft and delicious. You shouldn’t reject a food without trying it first, after all.”
“Yuck”
Outside the room, the sun has almost completely gone down, and the color of the sky has begun to change. The sound of chairs and tables being cleaned up can be heard from the square.
“Miss Kino. Are you awake?” A voice was heard as someone knocked on the door.
“Message from the chief. We will be dividing the share with our comrades. Would you like to watch?”


Two hovees were flying over the forest permeated by dusk.
Kino, Hermes, the chief and a few others were riding in one of the hovees. Meanwhile, something was suspended from the other hovee. At the end of the rope the sheets containing the pieces of elephant meat were wrapped together.
The hovee stopped a good distance into the forest.
The chief stood on the deck.
“Please accept this,” he said in a short message. He lowered his hands lightly.
The rope on one side of the sheet disconnected, and the contents fell. The dead flesh scattered on the ground. Soon, animals gathered in the place. From small ones, crows, to large carnivores, all of them ate up wholeheartedly.
“Our comrades,” the chief said.
“In nature, other creatures serve as food for other living things, just like us.”
While looking leisurely below, “So, this is their share, eh?” Kino said approvingly.
The chief also looked below leisurely.
“Yes, they were raised eating other creatures, and in turn, get eaten by other creatures. In this forest, our comrades live in great numbers, but never too many nor too few. Usually, we only take them during times of celebration.”
“I see…,” Kino said, and slowly leaned on the edge of the deck. She looked at the sky to the west. The orange lump will soon be touching the far-away mountain ridges.
They parted with their comrades, and the hovee set on its homeward journey while casting its long shadow on the forest.


Evening. Kino was invited to have tea with the elders.
‘What did you do yesterday?’ asked the chief, to which Kino replied that she stopped by the town along the sea.
And then the elders who were drinking tea suddenly exclaimed together.
“Those people are terrible!”
The chief made a sad face.
“Those people are very cruel. They live out in the sea, killing the cute fish and shellfish. These are taken alive, and they eat them, watching them die in cold blood. And in the end, they take the smart and adorable whales…”
The chief’s tone became rough.
“And those people dare say that our life of dependence on the blessings of the forest is cruel, brutal and ruthless. They have no right to say such thing, as they themselves don’t realize that what they are doing is the genuine form of cruelty. We can’t just calmly ignore them and accept their customs.”
“I see. So that’s the reason why you have lived apart,” Kino said, and the chief nodded slowly and spoke.
“However, I don’t think it’s a bad idea to see for yourself, Miss Kino, the cruelty and ugliness of those people.”


The next day, that is, the morning of the third day since Kino entered the country.
Kino got up at dawn. As usual, she performed her body exercises, and trained with and carried out the maintenance of her persuaders.
Kino was treated to a lavish breakfast in the chief’s home. In addition, she received a present of dried meat. Kino thanked them politely.
Kino departed, turning back from the grand farewell she was given.
They ran through the deserted part of the country. It was already past noon when they arrived at the western wall.
They passed through the fully automatic gates, and went out of the country.
“Now, shall we go?” Hermes said happily, but Kino replied with a lifeless voice.
“No. Before that…”
“Hmm?”
“I’m hungry.”
‘Ah’, Hermes was appalled, and let out a sigh. And with a touch of sarcasm in his voice,
“Why, of course. If you eat just that at night and in the morning, your stomach will be bloated.”
“No choice. I’d better roast and eat the preserved stuff they gave me. We’ll leave after that.”
Kino dismounted Hermes and secured his center stand.
“Well, whatever. I suppose that’s better than you fainting and falling down due to an empty stomach,” said Hermes.
“By the way, the fish mummy or the animal mummy, which one will you eat?”
While groping for something inside her luggage,
“Both”
Kino answered flatly.















"
7,v2c2,2,2,"Once upon a time, a traveler came to a small country in a valley.
The traveler who came riding a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) was looking around leisurely at the rich and beautiful farmlands and at the old and narrow historical town roads. They stopped in front of a wooden statue in the plaza.
The statue simply had the appearance of a human, and it was holding a long stick in its hand. At its feet, there was a creature which can’t be clearly identified.
The young traveler asked a resident, “What is this?”
The resident answered with a smile.
“This is the statue of an angel which descended from the sky a long time ago to save the country. With his club, he quickly exterminated twenty-two demons that tormented the people and restored peace in this country. And then he went back to the sky.”
“Angel? Descended from the sky? What’s that?” the motorrad asked.
The resident narrowed his eyes, and answered, 
“It’s a fairy tale. It has been handed down in this country up to now――”


"
8,v2c3,2,3,"A motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) was running on a meadow with a sparse growth of bushes.
The motorrad was loaded with traveling luggage on both sides and on top of its rear wheel. It was running on a road extending straight ahead, while letting its engine’s roar resound loudly. The reddish brown earth of the road was finely cracked due to the dry season.
The driver was wearing a brown coat, the extra long hem of which was rolled up to her thighs. She was wearing a hat with flaps covering her ears and goggles on her eyes. The face underneath it was young, around mid-teens.
Probably due to the glare of the sun right ahead, the driver lowered the brim of her hat a little with her left hand.
“Yup, I don’t need it after all,” the driver said all of a sudden. The motorrad asked in return.
“What? Kino.”
“My coat. I don’t need it while riding in this kind of season. It’s a little hot, see.”
The driver called Kino opened the collar of the coat to let in some air. She was wearing a black jacket underneath.
“Do you want to stop to take it off?” the motorrad asked.
“Nope, it’s fine. I can already see it. Look, Hermes.”
Kino pointed ahead of the road just before the horizon, at the rectangular shadows which were like rods laid down on the ground. Those were the walls of a country.
“I’ll wear just my jacket when we leave that country. The coat will be on top of the carrier. Since it will get hotter soon, I don’t have to replace my thin shirt, either.”
“What about the snowsuit? I suppose you won’t need it anymore?” the motorrad called Hermes asked. Kino nodded.
“Oh, right. Then I probably wouldn’t need the winter cap and the winter gloves either. After this, I can’t afford to carry too much until the next winter. Maybe I’ll sell them or exchange them for something, only I won’t throw them away. I took quite a liking to them,” Kino said with a slightly regretful tone.
“Well, it can’t be helped. Humans have a talent for completely discarding things that they don’t need, you know,” Hermes said in a consoling tone, and continued.
“Occasionally you’d see clumsy people, who don’t throw away things that they don’t need and have half of their rooms occupied.”
“There was an author who was like that. He suffered because he can’t throw away his books,” said Kino.
The walls quickly became higher as they approached, and eventually they arrived in front of the gates.


They passed through the immigration inspection by the gates.
Kino was referred to a hotel. By the time they arrived, the sun has already gone down.
After taking a shower and a meal, Kino rested in the lobby and looked at the country’s map.
“Oh! Welcome, traveler! It’s nice of you to come! Welcome to this hotel!”
Kino turned around as she was called by a big, heavily accented voice.
“You see, I am the owner of this hotel. Well, have a seat. If there’s anything you don’t understand about this country, I’ll show you the ropes.”
The man spoke loudly to the puzzled Kino. His voice echoed in the lobby. He seemed a little drunk. An employee at the reception desk overtly frowned upon this, looking at Kino.
Kino introduced herself and sat on the sofa. The man sat facing her.
Without waiting to be asked, the man talked about how he started the hotel by himself. In a one-sided conversation, he told her in a loud voice that right now, everything was left to the youngsters while he enjoyed a leisurely life.
Kino responded agreeably, as appropriate.
“Miss traveler must be here in time with the festival?”
Kino asked what he meant.
“Oh, so you didn’t know? Ok! I’ll tell you. First, I’ll tell you a bit about this country,” the man said and explained in simple terms.
This country was a kingdom, and there was a custom that the king should be a doctor.
The country has a well-founded social security system. All medical expenses are waived, and everyone receives treatment from the royal hospital. Moreover, under the king’s rule, the social status of those who were working as doctors was high.
“And, the so-called festival is not actually a festival, but more of an election day. The festival is just a bonus for the election. It’s a festival in honor of the election,” the man said.
“An election, is it? What do you decide on?”
The man grinned to Kino’s question. Then he lowered his voice on purpose.
“We decide on a ‘person who is not needed’. That person will be ordered dead. You see, unnecessary things should be disposed of completely.”


The man said that this was a historically significant thing, and began to explain about the election.
About 150 years ago, this country experienced a severe food crisis due to incessant poor harvests. Hunger and epidemic was widespread.
The king at the time planned a mass killing as a last resort. To select the people who would die, the citizens were made to vote on ‘a person important to them’, and the country decided to kill everyone ‘who was not chosen’. Even if he himself was chosen, the king would execute it.
Out of fear of the voting results, no one wanted to be ‘unnecessary’ to anyone. 
‘Even though we are under such a crisis, there was no one who was deemed unnecessary——’
The king was deeply moved by his people’s awareness, and was ashamed of his decision. In the end he chose to share and overcome the difficulties with everybody.
Soon they triumphed over the crisis, and this idea became a trigger to create the present welfare state this country has become.
Ever since, they made sure to perform an annual election with this historically significant meaning in mind. All citizens who can write shall write down the names of people important to them.
Every year, everybody’s name was written down. In this country, all people lived interdependently. Everyone celebrates that fact.


“I see…. Then, the truth is no one is actually disposed of?” Kino asked.
“Why, of course! That’s unheard of. We’re different from the sort of crazy country who would say, ‘Because you’re unnecessary, you’ll have to die.’ Just in case, we do have equipment for the disposal, but it has never been used once. It’s getting rusty there in the castle, where it serves as decoration. What do you think? It’s a nice story, isn’t it? Impressed, aren’t you!” the man said, letting out a rather annoying laugh with his heavily accented voice.
“Uhmm…”
A man around thirty who was wearing a suit stood next to the man, and spoke to him with a slightly troubled face.
“Father, may I request you to be a bit more quiet?”
“What?! Since when did you become so important?! This is the hotel I started, you know. Do you understand that?” The man yelled back. The man in the suit was flustered.
“Yes, but——”
“Hey! Go away now! Get to work! If you can slack off like me, you still have a long way to go. You are twenty years too early to dictate me! I’m with a visitor right now! Now, manager, do you get that?! What do you say now?”
“…Yes”
The son did not argue anymore, and left with a bitter face. The man looked at the back of his son, and snorted.
The man faced Kino again and spoke with a voice as loud as ever.
“Well, in the festival, everyone makes a lot of noise when they are drunk. Miss traveler, please feel free to join in. Everything’s free, and there are lots of delicious food and side dishes.”
“Thank you very much,” Kino thanked him meekly.
After this, Kino asked if there’s a place where she could exchange, or possibly sell the winter equipment that she no longer needs.
‘Oh!’ the man was surprised.
“Leave it to me. Tomorrow, I’ll ask the shop that supplies the hotel to collect your stuff for a high price, whether it be rags. We’ve been partners for a long time. They ought to consider something like that. When the festival starts, go to my place.” The man laughed again with his loud voice.
Kino spoke. “That’s very helpful.”
“Don’t mention it! Humans live to help each other! Then that means I just became a person important to you, miss traveler!” The man roared without regard for those around him.
Kino looked around the lobby for a bit, and asked.
“By the way, am I allowed to vote?”
“It’s too bad, but travelers aren’t allowed to,” the man said.


It was the morning of the second day since they entered the country.
Kino woke up at dawn.
She performed her light exercises beside Hermes, who was fast asleep. Kino trained with and maintained her hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) called ‘Canon’.
Several fireworks went off as Kino was eating her breakfast. In the road, a public announcement vehicle has been going around to broadcast, ‘Everyone, today is the election day. Please do not forget to cast your votes.’


Kino returned to her room after her meal.
She opened the bag and took out the thick winter jacket and pants, the winter cap with ear covers, and the leather winter gloves. She folded them neatly and placed them on top of the desk.
She gazed at these for a while, and whispered.
“You were very helpful. …Thank you.”
“You’re welcome,” said Hermes.
“What, so you were awake,” Kino turned around with a smile.
“Nope. I was talking in my sleep.”
“Really now…. Well, it’s almost time for you to wake up anyway,” Kino said, and Hermes replied with a grave tone.
“That’s difficult, you know. ‘In spring one sleeps a sleep that knows no dawn.’”
“……”
Kino fell silent.
“What’s the matter, Kino?”
“You did not make a mistake.” 
“How rude.”


Kino and Hermes went to visit the polls. They followed the people walking down the street.
The people were entering a large building surrounded by greenery at the center of the country. She received an explanation from the guards that the king serves as the director of the central hospital.
Kino and Hermes were not allowed to enter, so they simply observed the entrance for a while.
“For sure, your name will not be written this year.”
“Oh, yours too.”
A couple holding hands teased each other. There were also people who come with their families and ate their breakfasts leisurely on the lawn after voting.
“It’s so peaceful, isn’t it?” Hermes said.


At a little past noon, Kino was having a cup of tea in the cafeteria when fireworks set off once more. Someone announced that the election was over. The results were being tabulated, and once it turns out that ‘no one was unnecessary’, the festival will start.
“We’ll know by evening. Well, no one gets chosen every year, anyway,” someone said.
Later in the afternoon, Kino and Hermes finished their sightseeing and returned to the hotel. Stalls and tables were being set up and decorated in the roads and plaza around the hotel as hastily-made preparations for the festival.
Around the time the sun sank beneath the walls, the fireworks resounded for the third time. And then the public announcement vehicle broadcasted that the festival will be carried out as planned.


The festival began by twilight. There were lights everywhere, and the town has become lively.
Kino found the hotel owner and asked whether he was able to inquire about the sale of her winter equipment. ‘Ok! Leave it to me,’ the man, considerably drunk, said in a loud voice and led Kino to a nearby store.
He stormed in with a shout, and asked the shop owner how much he will take the items for. The owner gave his price. ‘We were friends, weren’t we? Raise it a bit more,’ the man pushed his considerably unreasonable request. After arguing for a while, the man reluctantly agreed to a much too high price, with a disagreeable look on his face.
“See ya! Enjoy the festival, miss traveler!” The man left the store with high spirits. The shop owner sent him off with impassive eyes.
Kino talked to the shop owner.
“That person seems to know a lot of people.”
The owner looked at Kino,
“And when you realized that, you asked him for assistance… that makes you one ugly customer. But if you don’t do such things, traveling would be hard, I suppose. Well, whatever. Don’t worry about it.”
“Thanks. By the way, will you please give me four of those shirts?”
‘Coming,’ said the owner, and wrapped the shirts in paper. Then he suddenly stopped.
“…You know, that person was not like that before. He started on his own and managed a splendid hotel, and yet he lost his wife. After he was advised by those around him to retire, he just drowned himself in alcohol everyday. But now, not only the neighbors, even his family and employees consider him a nuisance. Really, I don’t want to be like that. Alive just to cause trouble to someone,” the owner said with a bored tone.
‘I see,’ Kino murmured quietly.
After that, Kino slipped into the festival only to eat the food that was handed out. Then she returned to buy the things that she needed with a low price.
By the time she returned to the hotel, the hotel owner was drunken in the streets, making a lot of noise.


The next day, that is, the morning of the third day since Kino entered the country.
As usual Kino got up at dawn, then trained with and maintained Canon.
After a while, Kino noticed that it was a little noisy in the streets. She looked from the window and saw a car stop in front of the entrance. Several uniformed policemen entered.
Kino went down to the lobby. The son and family of the owner, dressed in pajamas, as well as the other employees were talking with the police.
Kino asked a hotel boy what happened. He answered with a grim expression,
“The owner is dead.”
“?”
Kino listened to his version of the story.
The owner did not go home last night, but no one worried because of the festival. However, he was discovered, collapsed in a back alley this morning. He was moved to the hospital and confirmed dead. It was a heart attack, apparently.
“That’s why I told him to stop drinking too much…,” the owner’s son said lifelessly, completely dazed.
After this, Kino looked on as the son and the family went away with the police.
He asked the boy whether there will be a funeral today.
The boy answered, “Nope. Too bad miss traveler, but in this country, there’s no such thing as a funeral. After the family is finished parting with the deceased, as early as this afternoon, the ashes will be put in the country’s mass cemetery…. After all, a human should exist only until the time of his death.”


Around noon.
Kino arranged her luggage, refilled Hermes with fuel, and departed. She was wearing her jacket, fastened with a wide belt on her waist. Canon’s holster was suspended from her right thigh.
The coat was rolled and tied up on the carrier.
They soon came to the western gate, where something like a park was spread out on the right side of the road. Big trees were planted on the ground, and here and there, benches, roofed lounges, and big stone monuments were built.
Several people were gathered in one corner, busy over something. When they broke up, they went towards the direction of Kino and Hermes. One person saw Kino and called out, ‘Hey, miss traveler.’ It was the dead owner’s son.
“We’re finished. It’s that stone monument over there. If you like…”
“Sure”
“We have to return now. Take care, miss traveler.”
After waiting for the group to pass through the gates, Kino pushed Hermes towards the stone monument.
A young man wearing a white robe and several workers who were cleaning were left behind.
“Doctor, we’ll be going ahead,” the workers addressed the man in the white robe. Afterwards, they collected their tools and returned to the gate.
The man wrote something in his documents. He noticed Kino and spoke while his hand moved.
“I am a doctor. I have to write down the proof of burial.”
“I see.”
Kino went in front of the stone monument, took off her hat, lightly closed her eyes, and moved her mouth a little. She explained to the doctor that she stayed in the buried man’s hotel.
“Is that so?” the doctor murmured. His hand stopped and he looked at Kino.
“Ah, uhmm… I’m sure you are about to leave the country, and have a long way to go. But, can I have some of your time? I just want to talk to you about something.”
“I guess it won’t hurt.”
“What? Is it an interesting story?” Hermes asked.
The doctor replied, “Well, I don’t know if you’ll find it interesting or not, but I’m sure it will make a good souvenir for your travels. It’s about this country’s wonderful system.”


The doctor finished working on the details in the documents and closed the file. After that, he guided Kino and Hermes to the nearest lounge.
The doctor suggested that Kino take a seat, and was about to sit down himself when he stopped and said that his robe will get dirty. Kino parked Hermes on the side and sat on him.
“Well, what’s the story about?” Hermes asked. The doctor smiled lightly, and spoke with a fairly normal tone.
“The truth is, that guy who died this morning, and was buried a while ago, was killed by me.”
Kino asked Without changing her expression. “What do you mean?”
“Well, it means just that. I killed that man with my own hands. When he was carried to the central hospital this dawn, it was merely acute alcohol intoxication, but his awareness was clouded. After the treatment, we confirmed that he was an ‘anonymous’. And so I had to inject a drug into his IV drip, and he died. I was slightly nervous. After all, it was the first time I did it on my own.”
“I don’t get it. What’s an ‘anonymous’?” Hermes asked.
The doctor said, “Ah, I’m sorry. Let me see… ‘anonymous’, in this country’s medical terms, is what we call the people whose names were not written by anyone in the election. Those whose continuous existence was determined to be useless. Uhmm, are you aware of the election, and its historical background?”
Kino nodded and spoke. “But I heard that no one has been discarded from the very beginning up to now.”
The doctor spoke with an amused tone, “All of those were lies.”
“…Then, in reality, you got rid of people before?”
The doctor nodded. “Yes. Since the start of the great famine, there was a fair amount of anonymous. Mainly, we thin out the population with children, or useless old people. The king at the time was a person of conviction. He would do something once he decided to. But of course, public executions leave a bad taste. If his rule were to be thought of as a reign of terror, the rest of the people who were chosen as ‘necessary’ will not be too happy. And so as not to bother anyone psychologically, we came up with the idea of disposing people in secret.”
“To be exact, how did you do it?” Hermes asked.
“It’s simple. Ah, did you know? The king is a doctor. He is the head of the central hospital, and all doctors are directly under him,” the doctor said a little proudly. Kino nodded.
“We doctors perfected a variety of means to dispose of people in the hospital. Once the voting results are out, the names are added to the list. On the instance that that person is brought into the hospital, he will be killed right there and then. Until the next election, that is.”
“I see.” “Uh-huh”
“Those who are seriously ill or injured will die even if you leave them alone. Those who are not will be disposed of by saying that their condition has changed suddenly and that they are to be given a drug through their IV drip. The easiest to deal with, and the most common, are traffic accidents. If the injury is not a big deal, you can reason out that they hit their head and had a brain hemorrhage. Another simple case would be alcohol poisoning,” the doctor continued.
“However the truth is, sometimes, there are anonymous which are vigilant and leaves no openings. There are people who don’t get sick or injured. In those cases, we can’t do anything. We dispose of them by making up a sickness during the annual physical examination mandated by law.”
Kino asked, “And you continued to do this every year?”
“Yes, that’s right. It has become something like a tradition. In a year, there’s about a dozen. The people who are disposed of, that is.”
“Was it ever exposed?”
“Well, there are some suspicions…. However, even if the official cause of death is accidental, no matter how you look at it, the truth is they died because they’re ‘not useful to anyone’. Nobody was suspicious enough to meddle with and question the cause of death. At first, the families would grieve exaggeratedly. But they are actually secretly delighted, and by the next day, no, as soon as the burial is over, they’d go about their lives afresh. They will be given their insurance punctually, and the country will answer for the burial expenses. In cases of traffic accidents, the perpetrators who unknowingly lent a hand in the disposal will be judged rather favorably.”
“I see.”
The doctor turned over the documents he was holding.
“Uhm, in this person’s case…, ah, as expected, there were less votes for him in the previous year, as well as in the year before that. Recently, he was becoming more and more annoying. That he was the first to be disposed this term is purely coincidental. He was carried into the hospital just when the duty was left to me. It was a simple case.”
The doctor closed the documents. And then he let out a big breath.
“But, I was really pretty nervous. I wouldn’t know what to do if he wakes up while I was doing it. But I finished it safely, wrote the medical certificate, and now the burial is also over. Again I feel that my experience as a doctor piled up. That’s why I wanted to talk about this to someone,” the doctor said, slightly embarrassed.
“Only the doctors know about this? Or are the nurses involved too?”
The doctor nodded to Kino’s question.
“Only the doctors and the nurses. After graduating from the royal university in medicine and nursing, there’s a national certification exam. When you pass, there will be an audience with the king who will personally tell everything to you for the first time. Ah, actually, the disposal can only be done by doctors.”
“When you learned about it for the first time, what did you think?”
“I was… impressed. I was surprised, and there was that feeling of being deceived. However, the king’s powerful words touched my heart: ‘Ladies and Gentlemen. Useless things are not necessary. The preservation of anyone who holds value to people or to the country, and the complete disposal of the unnecessary ones is important. And you who are here now, who have the highest skills and ambition, will now bear this obligation.’ ——Well…, I was deeply moved…”
The doctor’s eyes moistened slightly. And then he looked at Kino, eager to speak.
“I was thinking, humans are supposed to live among themselves, right? And so, those who are determined to be unnecessary should not exist. They have to be discarded. This is a very natural thing. It is to build a country without waste. It’s a genuine welfare program. And all of that was accomplished with only the medical field involved. That’s why I find this job very rewarding.”
Kino was silent while listening to the doctor’s story.
“Was there ever a case where you failed to get rid of someone?” Hermes asked.
“That’s unthinkable!” the doctor said with a loud voice as he got fired up.
“It’s unforgivable for doctors and nurses to fail! We take pride in that. If there’s a chance that a person will fail because of pressure in time and situation, then his wisdom will be complemented by a number of people with knowledge and experience. If a person can’t still do it even with that, then he has to return his diploma immediately,” the doctor said with a stern tone.
“I want to gain more and more experience in healing as well as in disposing. ‘A person who saves should be certain to save, and a person who disposes should be certain to dispose.’ I want to be able to stand on my own soon.”
“I see. Yup. That was quite interesting,” Hermes said. The doctor was embarrassed for being slightly fired up.
“Thank you for listening to my story. Inside the country, such a thing cannot be mentioned, so now I’m totally refreshed. Miss traveler, if ever your body’s condition gets bad, don’t hesitate to come anytime. I will take responsibility for your care. No matter how difficult an operation is, or how long the hospitalization will take, and even if it’s a traveler, we do not take any payment. This country is proud of delivering the best treatment there is.”


The doctor lightly shook hands and returned to the gates.
Kino pushed Hermes out of the cemetery and started the engine. She looked once at the stone monument, and took off.
“……”
For a while, Kino rode Hermes in silence. They went through the meadow road lined up with bushes.
Eventually, Hermes spoke. “Kino. Let me guess what you’re thinking right now.”
“Hmm? Oh,” Kino said.
“That’s amazing, if you can guess it,” she added.
Hermes spoke with an air of importance, “Well…, from that doctor’s story, and based on my own experience up to now, you must be thinking like this,
‘Ah, it’s just that…. I don’t have any big injuries or anything, but it would have been nice to receive some medical exam in the hospital. Even though I hate injections.’”
“……”
Kino fell silent. The motorrad ran smoothly, its well-regulated engine echoing.
“Hermes…”
“Hmm?”
Kino spoke with a sour face. “That’s correct. Word for word.”
“Isn’t it?!” Hermes said happily. And immediately,
“Ah! Which reminds me,” he said with a loud voice. ‘What?’ asked Kino.
“Did you sell the winter gloves?”
“Yeah,” Kino nodded.
“But, didn’t you say that you don’t like the gloves you have because they hurt, and so you would set it aside for picking up firewood or working until it’s all tattered? Not too long ago.”
“……”
Kino suddenly hit the brakes. The rear wheel loudly stopped with a slide.
Kino faced the road that she has just ridden through. She could not even see the shadow of the walls beyond the horizon.
“…I did say that.”
Kino gazed at the road with a disappointed look on her face, and Hermes spoke with a perfectly normal tone.
“How unexpected of Kino to make a careless mistake.”
“……”
Kino shook her head lightly. Her face still had a bitter look.
“What now? Are we going back?”
“We can’t do that,” was Kino’s firm answer to Hermes’ question.
“What about the gloves?”
While looking at the direction they were heading to, and moving the front wheel towards that course, Kino answered,
“Someday, somewhere, I’ll find a replacement for it.”
“I see.”
“Let’s go.”
After saying this, she launched Hermes.
In a moment, the spinning rear wheel kicked up dirt, and the motorrad rode away.


"
9,v2c4,2,4,"My name is Riku. I am a dog.
I have long, white, bushy fur. My face makes me look like I’m always happy and smiling, but it doesn’t mean that I am. I’m just born this way.
Shizu is my master. He is a young man who is always wearing a green sweater. He lost his homeland due to some complex circumstances, and is now traveling by buggy.
And I am together with him.


There was a time.
We stumbled upon a country in a highland covered with forests.
The people used the gentle slopes as dairy farms. Between the level land at the bottom of the valley and the river was a town. There were high walls bordering the town, while the farms were surrounded by simple enclosures built from stones.
“What a peaceful and beautiful place,” Master Shizu said happily from the driver’s seat. He was clad in his usual green sweater.
“It’s small though, as if it’s only a village,” I said.
“It’s not necessarily a good thing for a country to be big. The question is, whether its inhabitants are living in happiness and contentment,” Master Shizu continued with a calm tone and narrowed eyes.
“But there is no answer to the question of what happiness actually is. Neither is there one to the question of what is important and what is not.”
“……”
Master Shizu, who realized that I was looking at him, suddenly laughed.
“For now, let’s check it out.”
He turned on the gears of the buggy.


We descended the slope.
The residents who were doing farm work noticed the buggy, and looked alarmed for a moment. Master Shizu got off the buggy. He walked closer and called out to them, but they hurriedly returned to the country. After waiting for a while, several men came.
Master Shizu introduced himself as a traveler, and asked permission to enter and stay in the country. The men asked Master Shizu if he had any weapons.
Master Shizu showed them his favorite sword beside the driver’s seat. When he was asked whether this was all that he had, Master Shizu nodded. They then asked him if he doesn’t mind that they could not offer him hospitable accommodations. Master Shizu nodded once more, and they gave their approval.
We were told to keep the buggy in a big storehouse near the gate, and that the reason will be explained to us later.
Master Shizu hid the buggy and took his big black cloth bag. His sword was inside it. We walked after a guide and passed through the gates.
Houses no higher than two floors were densely built in the entire town. The alleyways were like mazes in complexity.
Master Shizu looked leisurely at these and commented on their antiquity and peculiarity. When we arrived at a place where the alleys bend back and forth complicatedly every few steps, Master Shizu remarked,
“This place is perfect for hide-and-seek.”
The guide only gave him a somewhat incredulous look.


After walking around the town for a while, Master Shizu and I were guided to a house where the residents gather.
Apparently, it was this country’s assembly hall. There were a number of men and women distributing tea. Master Shizu was invited to take a seat, and then they exchanged greetings.
For the time being, they welcomed the visitor.
“A traveler, eh? Well, what do I say…, we would like to welcome you, but you have come at an inopportune time,” one man said with a gloomy expression. The other men had the atmosphere fit for a funeral.
“There seems to be some problem…. If you don’t mind…,” Master Shizu said.
They looked at each other for a while, and one of them opened his mouth to speak.
“Thieves are sponging off our country.”


Their story went like this.
For ages, this country had no foreign enemies; the people lived a happy and leisurely life.
The country was small and had no army or police. Rare disputes were suppressed by the young men.
Several years ago, a group of men riding horses came to the country. Because they were starving, they wickedly killed and ate some of the livestock.
Naturally, the residents objected and defied them. However, the men who tried to stop these thieves were killed.
The residents trembled in fear before the thieves. They were coerced to prepare food for the thieves who will visit once every month. If they dared refuse, the thieves threatened to rampage and destroy the country.
“Even if we have walls, we cannot leave behind our crops, and if the river is poisoned, we will not be able to live. In the end, we decided that if it’s just food, then we can abide to their wishes. We had to pick up the courage to make that bitter choice,” one man said.
“I see,” Master Shizu said softly.
Ever since, the thieves would come punctually each month, and leave after shamelessly taking the food.
Because of them, there was nothing left of the food that the people kept in reserve until then. If there were to be a severe crop failure, the residents will surely starve. Everyone had to work hard day by day.
“This disturbed our peaceful lives greatly, and it has been tormenting our minds recently…,” one man said.
“I understand it very well. Thank you for telling me this painful story,” so said Master Shizu. He pondered something for a while, and then asked,
“When would they be here next?”
“Tomorrow. We have prepared the food. But we don’t know how long we had to endure this.”
“How many of them are there?”
“There are always around twenty people. However, they’re all men, and all ride horses and carry persuaders (Note: a gun)…. They don’t think anything of killing people. You too mister traveler should better be careful not to run into them during your travels. They might take away your car and kill you.”
“Mister traveler, if you can, when you arrive in a nearby country, please tell them of our suffering and ask them to save us. However… there can’t be any country that would send people to help a small country such as this on a whim, right? There’s no merit to it at all…. We understand that. We have to solve our own problems. But, no matter how you look at it, what’s impossible cannot be done. It’s embarrassing, but the only thing we can think of now is how we won’t survive without that food,” one man said sorrowfully. The other residents nodded with faces of resignation.
Master Shizu contemplated about something once more.
And then, he told the gloomy men that he has a question.
‘What is it?’ the men replied. With all attention on him, Master Shizu asked with a smile,
“Do you mind if I take another look at the town? I have taken quite an interest in it.”


Taking a young man with him as a guide, Master Shizu examined the minute details of the town with relish. He went around, alley by alley, and confirmed the complex connections. He would come and go around the same place repeatedly.
The women and children were looking at him curiously as if thinking, ‘What in the world is this traveler doing?’ Meanwhile, I…
“A dog—. So big and so white—”
…was chased around by the children.
There was a plaza near the gates. Over there, the residents were stacking up boxes and sacks. The guide spoke.
“Those are… the food that will be taken away tomorrow.”
“That’s a lot. I understand your worry if that much is being taken away from you. During that time, what do the residents do?” Master Shizu asked.
“Because no one wants to get killed, everyone hides in the storage area in their basements. Nobody else goes out. Nothing’s happened yet, but if they start taking women and children…, ah, we can’t bear the thought.”
“I see,” Master Shizu said in a small voice to the man who answered with a shake of his head.


That evening.
They provided one room in the assembly hall for Master Shizu and me. It was a small room with just one bed, but Master Shizu composedly accepted his simple dinner and politely expressed his gratitude.
“Beholden for a night’s lodging and a meal, eh?” I asked Master Shizu, who started to maintain his sword under the light of a lamp.
Master Shizu took ample of time conditioning his sword, and then returned it to its sheath when he was finished.
“I don’t think it’s such a big deal,” Master Shizu said as he looked at me.
“I can help these people in trouble. I don’t really need any other particular reason. It’s also possible that I’m not doing it for their sake.”
“I see. How are you planning to do it?”
“I’ll ‘persuade’ them,” was Master Shizu’s short answer.
I asked, “I don’t think this country’s residents would approve of your plan without raising any objection. It’s not a pretty thought, to have the residents annihilated by your meddlesome actions, don’t you think?”
“Yeah, that’s why I’m doing this on my own accord.…However, that doesn’t mean that I have already decided to do it.”
“?”
Master Shizu looked at my face and spoke in jest, “If I can’t ‘persuade’ them, I’ll turn tail and run.”
And then he continued, “That’s why the inhabitants of this country are totally blameless. There are things that people can and cannot do. There are things that are suited for someone like me, and things that I’m not cut out for.”
I asked him one more question.
“Do you like this country?”
Master Shizu smiled a little.
“Maybe”


The next day.
All of the residents stubbornly locked themselves up in their houses since morning. The weather was good, but there was nobody walking around in the town.
We were also told to stay hidden in the basement, but we did not. We stayed in our room.
Master Shizu wore his waterproof parka with a hole on its left hip, and hung onto his neck the goggles he uses when driving the buggy.
A film [1] was affixed on the goggles in front of the eyes. Its roll case was attached on both sides. With a single pull of a string, he can clear his field of vision in a moment, in case it gets soiled by mud or other dirt.
Master Shizu looked at the plaza from the window, his favorite sword by his side.
The boxes containing food were piled up, and tied up along with it is a goat. Right before it were the gates that will be opened by the thieves.
I was lying on my side by Master Shizu’s feet, waiting.


Probably about noon, the sound of advancing horses was heard. It was headed towards our direction.
“So they’ve come,” Master Shizu said. I also stood up.
Passing through the gates, the men riding horses appeared.
They were men of different ages, from young ones to those at the prime of their life. They were dressed in clothes which were filthy but easy to move in. On their backs were long rifle-type persuaders.
One by one, they passed through the gate without any caution and climbed down their horses. The plaza, which was not so spacious to begin with, was filled with horses and men.
The men raised a cheer over their reaping. Then they immediately began to load the boxes onto their saddles.
“Twenty-two,” Master Shizu said.
“As we’re told, they’re all men.”
“Almost all of their persuaders are rifles, eh? Just as I thought. How convenient.”
“Will you do it?” I asked.
“Yeah,” Master Shizu answered.
He strapped his goggles on and wore the sword on the belt fastened around his waist over the parka.
Master Shizu walked towards the plaza while I waited by the shade of the house.
The thieves made strange faces upon seeing Master Shizu who looked quite unusual with the parka, sword, and goggles. A number of them immediately took the persuaders from their backs and loaded them.
“Hello.”
Master Shizu spoke in a completely normal tone as he slowly approached. Among the thieves, a bearded middle-aged man who was not doing any work lightly waved his hand to his comrades. Other than a person beside the bearded man who had his rifle-type persuader ready, all the other men returned to loading the boxes on their saddles.
“Yo, brother. You’re not from this country, are you?” the bearded man said. Master Shizu stopped from a distance, and stood in front of them.
“Yes, I’m a traveler. I just arrived here yesterday.”
“Whether you know it or not, these are our rightful earnings. Don’t interfere, mister with goggles and sword.”
“I’m not interfering,” Master Shizu immediately said, and then continued.
“But won’t you listen to one last request? I want you to stop troubling the people of this country.”
“Huh? Did the leaders here ask you to say that?” the bearded man asked.
“Nope. I’m doing this on my own accord.”
“……”
The bearded man looked at Master Shizu with an appalled expression for a while.
“Brother. You won’t live long, you know.”
“Really?”
With a sour expression, the bearded man admonished and threatened him.
“A person who gets into a fight he cannot win is an idiot. I can say from my experience that you will get yourself killed.”
“My thoughts, exactly. By the way, your answer?” While saying so, Master Shizu moved his body lightly and subtly, and approached them with a half-step.
“Huh?”
“Won’t you stop this?” He took another half-step as he spoke.
“……”
The bearded man was dismayed, and this time, he moved his fingers to shoot Master Shizu.
The man took his persuader, aimed at Master Shizu’s heart, and fired at point-blank range. Master Shizu took the sheath with his left hand, held the sword grip in his right hand, and pulled off the sheath with his left. The blade which appeared deflected the bullet obliquely.
Master Shizu took two steps forward, struck the man with his left shoulder, and thrust the sword deeply into his heart. While this man fell to the left, he pulled out his sword and mowed down the neck of the bearded man in front of him. As this guy fell forward, he slashed the man right behind diagonally from the shoulder. All of this took place in roughly four seconds.
Blood spurted around Master Shizu in an interesting manner, making splattering sounds in the background. As a result, the waterproof parka became of use to Master Shizu.
Three men down.
The thieves froze in place as they witnessed this scene. They did not realize immediately what was happening.
“Y…y…y…y” A nearby man was trying to say something.
“You bastard!” The words which he was finally able to spit out were his last. Soon, he was impaled through his stomach.
Master Shizu ran, burst through the men who were still working, and skillfully killed each person en route. It was in complete rhythm.
The second man, who was to the right of the first, had his windpipe gouged out with the edge of the blade. The third was disposed of with a direct attack to his chest. The fourth man, who was carrying a box, had his head and both arms severed. The box fell right below, with his arms still attached.
Master Shizu made a turn while running and vigorously cut down the fifth man’s torso.
As the upper half of the body fell on the ground, Master Shizu ran through the plaza and concealed himself beside a house. One guy who had fast reflexes fired at Master Shizu, but he has already disappeared and was not hit.
Eight dead bodies or rather, ‘humans who were turned into corpses in a blink’ tumbled in the plaza. Meanwhile,
“Damn!” “Kill him!” “Chase him!” “Son of a *****!” “That bastard!” “That a*****e!” “Beat him to death!”
The thieves shouted out their feelings without reserve.


I turned from the opposite side of the house, took a detour, and ran through the alleyway where Master Shizu headed. Soon, I found Master Shizu waiting in ambush in one corner of a narrow alley.
When I tried to approach, Master Shizu lightly shook his hand, and I stood back aside.
From the corner of the alley, the barrel of a long persuader peeked. Master Shizu pulled it with his left hand and thrust his blade on the throat of the man who appeared. At the same time, a stray bullet flied out and bored through the wall of a house.
“Did you finish him off?” From the other side of the corner, the voices of other thieves were heard. Master Shizu answered.
“Yeah.”
Master Shizu pulled and threw down the man who exposed himself, and he vanished from my sight.
“Ugh—!”
“Damn y—!”
The voices of two people were heard. And then, Master Shizu returned, shaking off the blood from his sword.
When I approached, he asked me, “Three guys here, so only half of them are left?”
I nodded.
Master Shizu ran through the alley without making any sound, and I followed.
We stopped when we crossed a somewhat wide alley. We heard voices from the direction of the plaza.
“Someone fired.”
“Did they kill him?”
I lowered my nose and peeked. I saw three men coming towards our direction with their persuaders poised and bodies in half-crouching position.
I informed Master Shizu the number of opponents. He waited for a while, and after matching the timing, lightly poked his feet behind me.
I jumped out.
“Wha—!” A man was surprised and aimed his persuader towards me. I leaped to the opposite side.
“Damn, it’s a dog.”
“Don’t scare us like that!”
The men approached. Then, Master Shizu jumped out, passed through the man up front, beheading him. Before he could react, a fountain of blood spewed forth from his neck. Immediately after, the man behind received a blow on his chin from Master Shizu’s left elbow. Master Shizu moved his right arm longitudinally, moving his sword the same way, piercing through the man’s flank.
“Bastard!”
The last man turned his hand persuader towards Master Shizu. Master Shizu threw down the man who ‘would soon become a corpse’ with his left hand.
The man extended his arms and fired. It was too close. Master Shizu stepped up front to the right, and simply moved away from the line of fire. The man raised the persuader with both hands, and as he lifted it neck-high it fell in front of him.
“Eh?”
The man looked at his arms. They have become shorter. Blood curiously spurted out from them in rhythm with his heartbeat. Master Shizu grasped the man’s collar and stepped away from the corner I was in.
“Ah—? Ah—? Ah—?”
The man noisily flapped his arms, as if playing ‘otedama’ [2] At that moment, I saw Master Shizu’s shadow, about two feet away from the man, aiming.
Whoosh—! Boom.
There was the sound of a bullet cutting through the air, followed by the sound of a head exploding. Half of the head of the man Master Shizu grabbed vanished. He slightly dragged and flung the sacrifice, and went back to my corner. Immediately, he fired several bullets onto the wall.
“Just eight left.”
Master Shizu made a little run and proceeded to the interior of the alley. On the way, he pulled the string of his goggles and cleared the visor which has become dirty with blood. He also wiped off a piece of brain that splattered on his cheek.
Master Shizu, and me who was following behind, came to the place where the alleys bend back and forth complicatedly every few steps. Master Shizu deliberately flapped his parka and dropped blood all over the place. He went to and fro the same place.
And then he set his back against the wall of a house in a corner and quietly waited.
After some time, voices echoing from the walls were heard.
“Hey, let’s get outta here. The boss is already dead.”
“Are you going to let it end like this?! Let’s beat that guy to death!”
“But”
“Shut up!”
The two men approached noisily.
Master Shizu waited in silence. The footsteps came closer.
The men were drawn in by the bloodstains. They went towards three more in the opposite direction. Master Shizu jumped out. He confirmed the alley the two went into in one glance, and gave chase. I followed.
He caught up with the two as they turned around a bend. Master Shizu joined them from behind as if the three of them were comrades.
Master Shizu quietly turned one of the men before him from the back with his left hand. He covered his mouth and pierced his flank.
He released the man who died silently, and did the same thing to the second man.
“Six more.”
Master Shizu escaped the alley which was perfect for hide-and-seek, and nimbly ran through the town while checking both sides.
Master Shizu stopped all of a sudden, and I collided with his back.
Someone spoke. “Damn, another dead end.”
“Over here.”
I heard noisy running steps and impatient voices.
Master Shizu ran towards the direction of the voices. The two men ran towards the plaza. Master Shizu deliberately showed himself, and called out from behind the two with a big voice.
“Are you done?”
“Y-you bastard!”
One man was surprised, turned around and opened fire. The amateur shot completely missed. As if making fun of him, Master Shizu backed away a little from the aim of the second bullet.
Master Shizu gestured at me, and disappeared to the back of the alley.
The man who fired, still poising his persuader, came towards my direction. The man behind pulled his shoulder, and stopped him.
“Don’t chase him anymore!”
“But!”
“Don’t you get it? There’s no use getting killed in battle here. Let’s back off now!” the man behind said coolly.
He was right. The alleyways which could only fit one person were all memorized by Master Shizu, and he can win over them by silently laying ambush. The long persuaders they were wielding are a disadvantage in this kind of battlefield.
While I was thinking about this, Master Shizu, who took a detour from the back alley, jumped out and cut off the head of the calm man.
While the other man was surprised by the shower of blood before him, the blade thrust right through his heart.
“Four left, eh?”
“They’re not nearby,” I answered while chasing after Master Shizu.
“It will be bad if they get away.”
Master Shizu ran to the gate where the men entered. He spied on the plaza from the shadow of the house nearest the gate.
On the plaza where the corpses stumbled and the horses were standing, there were four people. Three of them were forcibly piling up the food on their horses. They were trying to drag the stubborn goat.
One person shouted. “Hey! Are you trying to get away by yourselves?!” He tried to pull a nearby man from his horse.
“Shut up!” The man pulled out his revolver and fired. Two shots to the chest.
“Three left,” Master Shizu said.
Immediately, one of the other men rode his horse towards the gate.
Master Shizu, who considered passing through my side, backed down a few steps. And then he ran towards the house.
“Hup—!”
Master Shizu climbed up the wall, scaled it in a moment, and extended his right hand horizontally. His sword grazed the horse’s ear and hit the rider’s throat, and then he jumped off to the other side.
Master Shizu landed. The headless horseman rode for a short distance, but soon the horse stopped and he fell over.
“Two more,” Master Shizu said, and slowly came out from the corner.
Those ‘two’ were finished loading up their horses, and was about to straddle them. They stopped as they saw the flying head of their comrade and Master Shizu appearing without hesitation.
Master Shizu walked towards the plaza as if taking a stroll. I separated myself from him a bit.
“D-die!” The man who shot his comrade, aimed his persuader at Master Shizu. Master Shizu simply stared. The man fired.
The first two shots missed. The third shot to the shoulder, and the fourth shot to the flank, were deflected by Master Shizu with his blade.
Master Shizu continued to walk. With an expression of shock on his face, the man continued to pull the trigger.
Click, click, click
“Eep–!”
The man threw the cylinder sideways and discarded the empty cartridge. From his waist belt, he took out a bullet reloader. And then,
“Eep—!”
Both his hands trembled so much that the bullets won’t get in. His hands were trembling and his teeth were clacking in fear.
Master Shizu’s footsteps came closer.
“E-eep—! ——Aack—!”
His frantic efforts were in vain, and the bullets fell from the reloader and scattered on the floor.
“Waah!”
The man threw away his revolver. It flew towards an empty space, and fell with a thud. Master Shizu vanished from the man’s field of vision.
The man’s eyes opened curiously. Our gazes met for a moment. At the same time, blood began to gush out from the throat of the man behind him, who stood rigidly in his place, and fell.
“Hey”
“Aaah!” From behind, the man’s right shoulder was pierced by a blade.
Master Shizu started asking questions.
“You guys, do you have any comrades?”
The man still stood on attention, and answered obediently.
“N-n-n-n-n-n-n-none!”
“Will there be an organization looking for you if you’re gone?”
“None!”
“You people do not have any proper training for battle. How come you were doing something like banditry?”
“B-b-b-b-because it’s easy. N-no, before we were farmers, but…, it was hard and painful… so we ran away from our country…”
“And so, you’re extorting from a small country?”
“Y-yes. L-life is not easy, you know!”
“…Yeah, you can say that again.”
The man was happy upon hearing Master Shizu agree, and turned his head and glanced at him. And with a somewhat twitchy smile, he spoke.
“I-isn’t it?”
Master Shizu smiled gently.
“That will be over, too.” Master Shizu moved his hand as he spoke.
“Huh?” were the man’s last words.
The face with the twitchy smile rolled on the ground, still smiling.


Master Shizu collected the riderless horses and tied them together. He removed his goggles and wiped his face. He took off his parka and rolled it. He looked for a place not wet with blood, and placed the parka and the goggles there.
“Master Shizu,” I spoke.
“Hmm?”
“Good job.”
“Stop it,” Master Shizu shook his head with a bitter smile.
“Killing people as a specialty —  that’s not something worth praising or something to be proud of.”


A considerable time passed before the residents timidly came out of their houses.
After he was finished wiping his sword and returning it to its sheath, Master Shizu leisurely sat waiting at the plaza.
Surprised screams were heard as the corpses were discovered all over the alleys.
Soon, a crowd gathered in the center of the plaza, the surroundings of which was dyed deep red with the corpses’ blood. As one would expect, there were no children.
Surrounding from a distance, the people looked at Master Shizu with surprised eyes.
“…Mister traveler. You killed them all? With a sword?” One man spoke. Master Shizu stood up.
“Yes”
“A-all of them…?” Another man asked.
With a countenance which was neither too happy nor sad, Master Shizu replied in an expressionless tone.
“Every single one of them. Twenty-two people. They do not have any comrades. From here on, you do not have to prepare food for them. You can go back to your original lives.”
When the people heard this, an expression of relief ran through their faces.
But this only lasted for a moment. Eventually, they turned a discerning eye at Master Shizu, who seemed to have transformed completely from the previous day. I saw the men speaking in low voices.
When Master Shizu realized the result of what he has done, he lightly closed his eyes for a short time.
“This is too much…”
The words of one man caused a spark.
“That’s right. No matter how you look at it, this is overkill. It’s too cruel,” another man said.
“But, this is…, it would have been better if they weren’t killed! And every single one of them, too. Don’t you agree, everyone?” A man raised his voice.
The people’s faces became cold. ‘That’s true,’ they answered. Everyone looked at Master Shizu from a distance with cold, sharp eyes.
One man took a few steps forward.
“Mister traveler. Do you realize what you have just done?” the man said.
“You’re a murderer!”
“……”
Master Shizu remained silent and listened to the man’s words.
“We, the people of this country, for whatever reason, couldn’t bear the thought of hurting people, much less killing them. It is evil. We must not kill. Am I wrong, everyone?”
Voices of agreement rose from the crowd, much louder than before.
“Mister traveler, we are different from you. We cannot approve of using violence against people, even if it’s only a little. We do not recall begging you to present us with a mountain of corpses.”
“That’s right. I did all of this on my own accord,” Master Shizu said austerely, while he gazed back at the people glaring at him.
“Mister traveler, we don’t want people like you in our country. Please leave this country immediately. This is what all of us think,” said a man who was acting as the representative of the residents.
Master Shizu gave a small nod. “I understand. ——Someone, please bring me my bag. It’s in the assembly hall.”
Soon the bag was brought before Master Shizu.
Master Shizu expressed his gratitude and hung his parka and goggles on the bag. With his sword still on his waist, Master Shizu carried the bag.
“I’m truly sorry for the trouble, but I’ll leave the disposal of the corpses to you. The persuaders and the horses though, still have plenty of use. Everything belongs to you,” Master Shizu said. No one said a word in reply. They all stared towards Master Shizu coldly.
“Thank you for letting me stay. Well then, I’ll be taking my leave,” Master Shizu politely thanked them.
“Let’s go, Riku,” Master Shizu walked and headed towards the open gates.
And I followed.


Master Shizu rode the buggy through the forest road. He was going slower than usual. The sunbeams streaming through the leaves flickered on the buggy.
Even when I looked back, the small country beyond the trees and the valley can no longer be seen.
I asked from the passenger seat, “Are you disappointed?”
Master Shizu shook his head. His expression as he gripped the steering wheel was the same as always.
“That place is their country. And that was their choice. We have to honor it,” Master Shizu said. And then he added,
“I wasn’t expecting anything more. This is good enough.”
“They sponged off on you, didn’t they?” I asked.
“Yeah. They are a strong people,” Master Shizu nodded.
I asked just one more question.
“Did you like that country?”
Master Shizu smiled a little.
“Who knows?”













Nope, the story has no relation to vampires… ^_^ The word ‘bloodsucker’ is synonymous to words like ‘extortionist’, ‘blackmailer’, ‘parasite’, etc., and refers to people who depend or ‘sponge off’ others.


"
10,v2c5,2,5,"“Hey, you.”
A man spoke all of a sudden.
The one he was talking to was a teenager drinking tea in the street’s open café. This person had short black hair, big eyes, and an intrepid expression on her face. Her black jacket was fastened with a wide belt on her waist, and suspended on her right thigh was a holster for a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol).
The man who spoke was about thirty years old. He was a normal-looking man wearing neat clothes.
“Me?”
The man nodded in reply to this question. Parked in one corner of the walkway was a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) with two boxes attached on the sides of its rear wheel. He pointed towards the motorrad.
“That’s yours? Are you a traveler?”
“Yes. We’ve been in this country since yesterday,” the young traveler said, and proceeded to introduce herself.
“I am Kino. This here is my partner, Hermes.”
“Kino, eh? Well, until when are you planning to continue doing this?” The man still stood, asking the traveler called in a sharp tone.
Kino asked the man with her usual expression. “Doing what?”
“Traveling on a motorrad. You seem very young, but why don’t you go to school? Well, I suppose that’s fine in the country you were born in, but if that’s the case, why don’t you get a job?”
“…It’s hard to explain everything, you see,” Kino answered with a shrug.
“Excuse me,” the man said shortly, and sat in front of Kino.
The man looked at Kino, almost glaringly, “Is traveling fun?”
“Yes”
“Didn’t you ever realize that you were wasting your life?”
“……”
The man had a tone as if scolding a bad student,
“You probably find what you are doing now as fun. Now, that is. However, your actions are without consideration for the future. You go from place to place, looking around, wandering aimlessly. But that’s all. At a glance, you’re free to do as you please. But with that, you are just playing, neglecting the duties that come with being a human. You are nothing but a rootless wanderer.”
“……”
Kino silently brought the cup of tea to her lips. The man continued.
“Humans have many duties they have to fulfill. First is work. To have a regular job, and to serve other people in the country. In short, you have a duty to become a full-fledged member of society by working. Another is to get married and to have a family. To make your spouse happy, to have children, to bring them up well, and to send them out as new members of society. These are duties which humans had from the very start. Traveling, wandering, the you right now couldn’t possibly accomplish these duties. Do you have any objections?”
“Nope,” Kino replied with a light smile.
The man became slightly more garrulous.
“That’s why traveling is a waste of your life. I told you before, right? You probably think I’m forcing this on you. Not to brag, but right now, I have those qualifications. You see, I have a job and a family to protect. That’s why, I want you to think a little about the sort of life you have. That’s why I talked to you.”
“I see. I’ll use that as a reference.”
“And one more thing,” said the man.
“Yes?”
“It would be better for you to stop riding a motorrad.”
“Really?” Kino asked with a light tone.
“Yeah. Motorrads are dangerous. Besides, only two people can ride on it. It’s an extremely uncivilized and primitive method of transportation. It’s improper for an adult, worrying and inconveniencing your family with an egotistical plaything. A car on the other hand, is an important and a must-have because it offers a reliable means of transportation. Traveling and motorrads, that’s the worst combination, ever.”
Kino glanced over Hermes,
“Thank you for your concern. But I would like to continue doing this.”
Upon hearing this, the man’s face slightly stiffened. He pointed at Kino, and spoke with a tone stronger than before.
“You did not understand what I told you at all. What do you take the opinion of the elderly for? Just because you’re young, you think you can go on wasting your time——”
Suddenly the man was taken aback and his face changed color as he looked at his wristwatch. He stood up.
“Someday you’ll regret what you did with your life!” He left these angry words and hurried away.
When the man was out of sight, Hermes spoke. “What an interesting person. I wonder what moved him to talk to you?” said.
“Oh, you were awake. Who knows? Maybe he bears a grudge against travelers and motorrads,” Kino said. She picked up the cup of tea and spread the map with her other hand.
“Well, it doesn’t matter. Hermes. Let’s go see the temple in the southern district after I finish my tea. The person who was here earlier promised me that it’s worth seeing.”
“Roger. We’ll be very busy in this country, huh?”
“Yeah. I wonder if three days is enough. There’s this fellow in the north which has skills of ‘ancient giant creatures’ that I want to see. But it seems that near some stone highway, there’s some awesome scenery. I also like to try their pan-baked deep-sea fish, but I also want to go to this open-air concert. And then——”


The man hurriedly ran to the entrance of a street where several stores were lined up.
An aging woman, a woman around thirty, and two small children were standing by the entrance. They all glared at the man who came running.
“You’re late! You left the car, and made us wait for hours!” The woman who seemed to be the wife, spoke to the man with a harsh tone.
‘Sorry, I’m really sorry,’ the man said, bowing several times.
“You should really get a hold of yourself,” the wife clicked her tongue.
At this moment, they heard the noisy sound of a motorrad’s engine, and eventually, the traveler passed in front of them riding her motorrad. The traveler saw the man, raised her left hand in a greeting, and rode away.
“Who was that?” the wife asked the man.
The man said that it was just a traveler he had a little conversation with earlier. The wife suddenly raised her eyes.
“Traveler? Wait, dear! Don’t tell me you still have that stupid idea of yours to go on a journey by yourself?” the wife cross-examined him. ‘No, not at all,’ said the man, and shook his head and hands.
“Is that true?”
‘It’s true,’ said the man as his wife glared at him. ‘That’s not a simple thing to do since I have a family, and a job as well,’ he added.
“Fine then,” the wife turned around and then stopped.
“Ah—! Don’t tell me you want to ride a motorrad? You vowed never to do that, but if I find out you’re secretly riding one, I’ll divorce you!”
‘D-don’t worry. Didn’t I sell it? A motorrad is dangerous. I’m thinking about our family’s welfare, so I can’t possibly be thinking of riding one,’ the man said.
“Hmph. Don’t you dare break your promise. It will be a problem if you die. …More than that, you should work harder to have a salary raise. Aren’t you supposed to buy the children nice clothes?” the woman said disinterestedly, and the aging woman chimed in.
“That’s right. You promised to make my daughter happy when you married her, didn’t you? If there’s no hope of getting ahead, then get ahead on your own. Work two, no, three times as much to make your own wife and children happy. That’s the meaning of being a full-fledged member of society, the duty of a human being. Do you understand?”
‘Yes,’ the man said shortly to his mother-in-law.
The wife pushed her hand luggage to the man.
“Then, let’s go! And get these quickly! You should serve your family once in a while! Quick, quick!”
They entered the shopping district with the children.
‘But I’m tired from work,’ the man muttered and sighed.
“Did you say something?” the wife asked without turning around, and the man immediately replied, ‘Nothing.’
The man turned his gaze towards the road. He looked at the unseen back of the traveler, and listened to the inaudible sound of the motorrad’s engine.
And then chased after his family in a flurry.
















"
11,v2c6,2,6,"There was a beautiful grassland. The grass carpeting the ground, as well as the wild flowers, danced as a gentle breeze swept across the field.
On this field was a perfectly straight road. The white road stretched out on and on and on. As to where this road leads to, it was not known.
A motorrad was running on it. It was heavily loaded with luggage.
The riding traveler noticed something and slowed down. It was a small child by the wayside, raising his hands.
The motorrad stopped. The child spoke,

“Please take me with you.”“No way! There is no more room,” the motorrad immediately said.
The driver asked,
“Where did you come from?”
The child did not answer.
“Where are you going?”
The child did not answer.
“What is your name?”
“×××××”
The child replied and said the same thing once more.
“Please take me with you.”
“No way! There is no more room,” the motorrad immediately said.
The traveler spoke, almost in a grunt,
“I cannot be in charge of somebody’s life. I already have my hands full looking after myself. And so, I cannot bring you along, you should stop your notion about it. I am selfish… I am very selfish.”
“It is not possible to travel with two people on anyway,” the motorrad chirped in.
The traveler approached the child, squatted down, and while looking at the child’s face,
“Goodbye, ×××××.”
With this, the traveler rode the motorrad and left.
There was a beautiful grassland. The grass carpeting the ground, as well as the wild flowers, danced as a gentle breeze swept across the field.
On this field was a perfectly straight road. The white road stretched out on and on and on. As to where this road leads to, it was not known.
There, a small child has been left behind.
There, a small child has been left behind forever.














"
12,v2c7,2,7,"“What a nice-looking country.”
A traveler who has finished passing through the gate said this as she looked at the scenery.
The traveler was around mid-teens. She had short black hair, and was wearing a long brown coat.
“You bet. It has been quite some time since we arrived in a modern and organized country. The immigration inspection was fully automated too,” answered a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) being pushed along by the traveler. The motorrad was loaded with traveling luggage on top and on both sides of its rear wheel.
The perfect townscape spread before the traveler and the motorrad. A number of wide, orderly roads were lined up. Here and there were parks abundant with greenery. The buildings lined up at the center of the country where beautifully designed, both in outward appearance and in arrangement.
The evening sun shined on this image of functionality and beauty merged into one.
“Now, what are we going to do, Kino?” the motorrad asked. The traveler called Kino answered,
“For today, let’s look for a place to stay the night. We’ll take a walk tomorrow.”
“Roger”
As the motorrad said this, a car stopped right in front of Kino and Hermes. Nobody was aboard the loading platform of the car.
‘Please hop aboard, I will accompany you to your place of destination,’ a machine in the vehicle informed them.
Kino asked for the price, and a reply came, telling them that they need not pay for anything.
“What do we do, Hermes? Is it okay with you to ride this thing?”
“I don’t mind. It’s probably faster than looking for a hotel by ourselves.”
“Okay.”
As Kino proceeded to push Hermes into the loading platform, a crane automatically extended for Hermes to board. Afterwards, a belt and wheel stopper came out and fixed him in place.
“How nifty,” Hermes said admiringly.
Kino climbed up and sat down. As expected, a belt automatically fastened itself on her, and the car set off.
The other cars running on the wide road were evenly spaced from each other. The cars were picking up passengers. In the park, they saw children who were apparently finished playing crowding up in the cars.
And then the car went towards the center of the country which was lined up with buildings.
They arrived in a splendid hotel. A machine by the entrance welcomed them. They were not charged a single cent.
Kino and Hermes were ushered into a tiny car, and guided to a splendid room while they were in their seats.
After the machine finished its duty as a hotel boy, it expressed thanks and left the room.
“What a relaxed country,” Kino said while hanging her coat on a chair. She was wearing a black coat underneath.
A high-caliber hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) was suspended from her right thigh. Another automatic-type was attached behind her waist.
“It’s nice not to have to do anything, huh?” said Hermes. Kino spoke While taking down the luggage.
“A while ago, I heard this rumor among travelers. The machines here were so developed that there was almost nothing else for humans to do. It seems that the citizens here don’t have to work.”
“Ohh. Then, what do the people of this country do everyday? Sing or dance, perhaps?”
To Hermes’ question, Kino only tilted her head and said that she had no idea.
“They might be doing something that we haven’t encountered before. Let’s go and look for it tomorrow. It will be fun.”
“If you like what you see, will you immigrate?” Hermes asked.


The next day. Kino woke up at dawn.
As usual, Kino performed her exercises as well as training and maintenance of her 0persuaders. She ate her breakfast after taking a shower and tapped Hermes awake a bit earlier than usual. Hermes complained that it was too early.
In front of the hotel, Kino was about to turn Hermes’ engine on, when an empty car came again.
“Really, we don’t have to do anything at all, eh? If I keep on taking it easy, my engine will get rusty,” Hermes spat in a tone which was either that of admiration or complaint.
When the car asked for their destination, Kino replied that she wanted to go to a place where people gathered. The machine told her that she has to be more specific.
Kino thought for a bit, and spoke. “A place where many of the citizens of this country go to in the morning, perhaps.”
‘Roger. I’ll take you to the office block in the central district,’ the car said and set off.
The car went through the wide road. As they approached the beautiful towering building, the number of cars running in the street increased. Upon closer inspection, men and women wearing neat suits with neckties were riding on the cars. None of them looked too cheerful.
Eventually, the cars stopped and lined up in a queue in front of the building. Kino and Hermes got off. In the vicinity, other people were also getting off from their cars. They disappeared into the building with quick strides. The empty cars left and the people rode in different cars.
“……”
Kino gazed at this scenery for a while.
“What do you think?” she asked Hermes.
“People heading for work. No matter what country it is, the usual morning scenery involves people going to work,” Hermes answered honestly.
“It sure looks that way…,” Kino said uncertainly.
“Wasn’t this supposed to be a country where people don’t need to work?”
“That was supposed to be the case…”
Kino looked around and called out to a middle-aged man who got out of a car which happened to stop nearby. However,
“I’m in a hurry,” the man bluntly declared, and disappeared into the building.
“He sure is busy,” Hermes said.
Kino tried to get into the building to ask somebody. However, a machine by the entrance rejected them politely, and told them that unauthorized people are not allowed to enter.
Eventually, there were no more people who were ‘going to work’.
Only Kino and Hermes were left standing in the road in front of the office block.
“What now?” Hermes asked.
Kino thought for a while, and when she was about to say something, a car stopped nearby. The door opened, and a young man came out in a flurry.
The man tried to enter the building but was not allowed. He dropped his shoulders and walked, tottering along the sidewalk.
“Perfect. Let’s ask that guy,” Kino said.


“I see, so you’re a traveler, eh?” the young man said in a lifeless tone. He was wearing a business suit and necktie, and was around his early twenties.
Kino, Hermes and the man were in a park in one corner of the office block. They were sitting on a bench in front of a fountain. There was nobody around. When Kino tried to talk with him, he invited them out to walk a small distance to this place, where they could settle down and chat.
The man summoned a machine going around the area and ordered drinks. ‘This is our currency,’ he said, and passed a card through the machine. Tea in a paper cup came out. Kino received her share for free.
“You want to know what we’re doing in that building?” the man said after downing half of his tea.
“Yes”
“We ‘work’ there. Everyday,” the man said.
“Work?”
“Yeah. I overslept and came in late so I couldn’t enter the company building. What a mistake! I was careless…,” the man said and then continued with a cheerful tone.
“Well, it’s too late to do anything about it. From now on, I’ll make sure not to do the same mistake ever again.”
“But wasn’t this country supposed to have machines that do everything so humans don’t have to work anymore?” Hermes asked. ‘That’s right,’ the man said simply, and continued.
“We don’t have to do any labor, but we have to [work].’”[2]
“?” “?”
The man continued upon seeing Kino’s puzzled face.
“Oh, right——. Hmm, I think the [work] I’m referring to must be different from your idea of work.”
Kino asked, “In other words, the [work] you’re talking about does not involve laboring or doing something for others, making something, selling something, or being of service to people?”
“That’s right. What you said just now is an old definition in this country, miss traveler. We don’t have to do that sort of stuff anymore because the machines do everything already. Well, with the exception of some people who have special abilities like painting and music, most of the people like me have to [work] as company employees.”
Kino nodded. “I see. I understand up to that part. Then, what is this [work] you and everybody else do everyday? And that said, why do you do it?”
The man made a few small nods while listening to the question. And then he answered.
“First, as to why, we have to earn money. It is something it has in common with the old definition. In this country, the citizens are guaranteed minimal living necessities, so money is not really necessary. We can live in a government-owned facility where food and clothing are provided until we die. But no one wanted to live a life like that of a prisoner. If we have money, we can live in a nice place, buy nice things, and eat delicious food. The more we [work], the more money we get. After all, it is necessary to earn money in order to live.”
“Uh-huh” “I see.”
“And, as to what we’re doing.”
“Yes”
“We receive stress.”
“Eh?” Kino replied.
“We receive stress. To undergo physical, and more importantly, mental stimuli which are by no means pleasurable —— that is this country’s definition of [work].”
The man put his empty cup beside the bench, and it was immediately picked up by a cleaning machine. The man continued.
“As to what we do exactly, I’ll give you an example of my [work] assignment. Since almost all citizens in this country are company employees, I believe it is the same for everybody. ——First, we dress up in neat clothes and go to office. We go to the company first thing in the morning and listen to the company president’s long and winding speech during the morning assembly. The speech is just made up of sentences with no particular meaning, but in any case, standing in attention and listening to it is really a pain. You could say that the way it was being delivered is a pain in itself. After that, I will be severely scolded by my boss. The reason for the reprimand will be randomly decided on by a machine. Yesterday, I was scolded for having a good time during the weekends. After that, there are various stuff…. Correcting errors in documents; making calculations without any real meaning; earnestly requesting something from a person whose [work] is to refuse people; understanding the bad results of our personality assessment; exchanging mutual insults with a co-worker regarding choice of clothes; bowing in shame to a person disguised as a customer…”
“……” “……”
“…Fetching unnecessary stuff from storehouses and taking a long time on purpose; putting them back in place and taking a long time again; and then coming back and being shouted at by your boss with words like ‘you idiot’, ‘imbecile’, ‘moron’, ‘trash,’ and so on; walking and visiting from house to house with no real purpose; riding in a bus meant for ten but contains twenty people to experience the unpleasant feeling of crowding together; playing a sport you’re bad at with your boss, and praising him even though he’s just as bad as you are; insulting female employees to the verge of sexual harassment; consuming bitter tea; photocopying once a day. In any case, there are various things. ——The salary you will receive will vary depending on the amount of stress you experience. The intensity of [work] and the salary of a full-time employee which toils from morning to night during weekdays is different from that of a part-timer which works only half the day. Of course, jobs will be decided based on a person’s age and experience. Experienced people receive more stress, and their tasks revolve around more important [work]. As for me, I’m still a freshman employee, so the way I’m treated is no big deal. I want to become more experienced so that I can earn more soon.”
Kino asked the man, “Uhm, since when did this [work] system started?”
“As to when it started…, it was there long before I was born. I don’t really know when.”
“Doesn’t the condition of your bodies diminish with this kind of [work]?”
“Of course, there’s that factor. Because it’s still stress one way or the other, once it accumulates, there’s nothing we can do about it. There are people who were hospitalized due to ulcers, extreme hair loss, insomnia, hallucination, ruined skin, overeating, and so on. Some commit murder or suicide. But most of the people don’t have problems, I think. Our free time is used cleverly, in letting our feelings out. During weekdays, upon getting home from [work], we drink with our buddies. No one ever complains, and everyone steadily performs their tasks everyday.”
“Why stress out yourselves just to earn money, to begin with?” Hermes asked.
The man shrugged, “Who knows? I don’t really know who or when someone came up with it but,” and continued,
“I think it’s such a wonderful idea.”
“Really?”
“Yup. Humans can’t live in comfort all their lives. If humans don’t experience some form of hardship each day, they will become lazy and useless. It is important to have something to do in one’s life. In old times, that is equivalent to working everyday in order to live, but now it is [work]. I feel that people long ago created this system because they understand this. If machines do everything for us, humans will live only a life of lethargy, and someday this country will be in ruins. The citizens are given their everyday stress, and they are given money for their efforts. It’s killing two birds with one stone.”
“Are you pleased with your life in this country? Don’t you find this [work] unpleasant?”
“Yes, I like it. The [work] is unpleasant at times. But, as a social responsibility, receiving stress precisely each day is a very good thing to fulfill our duties as adults. Last year, I was still a minor, relaxing and doing stupid things, thinking ‘Ah, starting next year, I too will [work] everyday…, wear a suit and necktie each morning and go to [work]…’ It felt like something I don’t want to do. But now, everyday I get to look dignified, or rather pressured, but have this feeling of contentment at the same time. When I started, it felt as if I’m already a full-grown man. Now that I think about it, I couldn’t forget the smile on my parents’ faces when I received my first salary. My father told me, ‘With this, you are now also a fine adult. It was worthwhile bringing you up.’ That time I was really so happy…”
“Uh-huh,” Hermes interjected.
“There’s this saying that I really like. ‘Weariness from [work] is not the same as that from play. A night after [work] is more refreshing than a night after play.’ ——In my life, I wish to have much more nights after [work] than nights after play. Than getting tired everyday from play, I’d rather experience pleasant fatigue everyday from [work]. That way, I get to truly enjoy my precious leisure time. Someday, I’ll get older and eventually have a family of my own. When that time comes, I will [work] with my whole energy not just for my own but for my beloved family as well. Once my family greets me with a smile, each day’s weariness will be blown away all at once. And I’ll serve until retirement age. Until that time, I will do what I can above my limits. From the lowest, I’ll be a department head; if I can I’ll aim to be a manager, and if I feel like it, maybe I can be the company president too. That is my life’s dream. This country is a really good place because you can achieve your dreams with your own efforts — because it gives each citizen a goal, something to live for.”
The man looked up at the blue sky, and said this with a fresh smile. He faced Kino.
”Miss traveler, if in case, you are thinking of immigration, this country is a good choice. I am recommending it to you. There is [work] for everyone. As a middle-class citizen, your lifestyle will depend on your efforts. Immigrants are always welcome. ——Think about it.”
“Yes. Thank you very much,” Kino said with a smile.
“Do you have something else you would like to ask?”
Kino thought for a while.
“Just one thing. It has nothing to do with the [work] we were talking about earlier. Yesterday, my hotel and meal expenses were free, but I’m about to leave the country. When I go shopping, how will I pay for stuff that I need for traveling?”
“Ah—, I wonder…. Indeed, if it’s only a few days, guests are not charged anything. Not many stay for too long. Since you do not have a card, it will be hard to trade in this country’s marketplace. If you go and ask the machine in a shop, I think it will be able to tell you more details.”
“I see. Thank you very much. It’s only because I have a few things that I need.”
“I see. Well, it’s about time for me to go home. I’ll have to try my best again tomorrow. For today, I guess I’ll just read a self-improvement book in my room. Ah, if you are going to buy things, the shopping center at the center of the country would be good.”
Kino thanked him once more, and the man left.


In the bench, Kino requested one more cup of tea. She drank the tea leisurely while looking at the scenery of the towering building and the empty park.
“What are we going to do after this, Kino? Are we going around the country?” Hermes asked. While gazing straight ahead, Kino answered.
“Hermes, I… heard something very good…”
“Huh?”
“That person before. I heard something very good from him. I heard something valuable from his story. I feel like I just realized what I should do from now on…”
Surprised with Kino’s serious face and tone, Hermes asked.
“Huh? Wait, what are you planning to do? …Don’t tell me you like to live in this country, Kino.”
Kino looked at Hermes, and spoke as if he just said something ridiculous. 
“That’s not it,” and then she continued,
“We should go shopping.”
“Huh?”
“Well, it’s all free right? Ammunition, food, fuel, clothes… other things that can be exchanged for high value in other countries. This is a rare chance. Let’s use today and tomorrow to grab everything we can before we leave.”
“……”
Kino stood up. And then she politely handed the empty paper cup to the cleaning machine.
“Let’s go, Hermes. Humans should relax whenever they can. Today is certainly the time for that,” Kino said energetically when she came back.
“Like teacher, like student.” [3]
Hermes whispered with deep emotion.
“Hmm? Did you say something?” Kino asked as she pushed Hermes along.
Hermes answered with his usual tone.
“Nothing.” 



"
13,v2c8,2,8,"There was a traveler named Kino. Despite her young age, she was very skillful with persuaders (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol), and almost no one could surpass her.
Kino’s partner in her travels was a motorrad called Hermes (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly). His back seat was turned into a carrier, and was piled with tons of luggage. Since Kino was a traveler, she was visiting many countries.


Once, Kino and Hermes saw a very high tower beyond the forest up ahead. Because it was extremely high, it could be seen even from a rather great distance and it looked like a thread hanging down from the clouds.
After Kino and Hermes arrived there, they discovered a country surrounded by common walls with the brick tower in the center of it.
When they entered the country, they saw a great number of people working hard beside the tower.
“Welcome, traveler. Please feel free to take a look around,” said a citizen of this country.
Greeting him, Kino asked gently:
“What a magnificent tower. If you don’t mind, can you tell me how long it took to build it, and what the purpose of its construction is?”
“It took 230 years, but no one knew why it was built,” the man said without hesitation, and then continued:
“The construction of the tower started long ago, even before letters were created. The purpose is a matter of no consequence. This tower is what makes our life worth living.”


The next day Kino woke up at the crack of dawn.
When the sun has risen significantly, Kino slapped the sleepyhead Hermes as usual and they went to view the tower. Since the weather was great, even the highest points of the tower were visible, though barely.
Near the tower, the people were drying the earth carried by the river and were making bricks. The bricks were transported using the stairs in the center of the tower, and the tower grew higher and higher. Sometimes the bricks that were not installed properly fell down from a monstrous height, so it was quite dangerous.
Kino was inspecting the tower very cautiously, but with great interest. Hermes, who usually makes remarks about buildings, muttered weakly:
“Kino, it’s going to fall apart. There are a lot of cracks at its foundation. It can collapse even tomorrow, if there comes a strong wind.”
Kino nodded lightly, but she didn’t tell anyone about this.
A storm arose at night.


The next day, in other words their third day in the country.
While Kino was diligently eating her buffet-style breakfast at the inn, a great noise was suddenly heard from the outside. Someone screamed:
“The tower is falling apart! Be careful at the west side!”
Kino and other people who were at the inn ran outside. They saw the tower slowly crumbling down. Its foundation became weak and broke into pieces. Unable to hold its weight, the tower collapsed completely in a while.
Soon, after the roaring sound has stopped and the air has been cleared of dust, everyone saw a huge pile of bricks lying at the place where the tower stood earlier.
The people danced atop of it, letting out screams of joy:
“It fell apart! It crumbled!”
“After 230 years!”
“It collapsed in our generation! I’ve seen it with my own eyes!”
“Yahoo! Congratulations!”
A man spoke to Kino:
“Miss traveler, the tower has finally collapsed. We’re so happy that we’ve witnessed it.”
“What are you going to do from now on?” asked Hermes.
The man instantly answered: “Well, of course we are going to build a new one! We’ll try our best to build it in such way that it stands for 300 years!”
“I see,” said Kino.
Soon the citizens of the country gathered a meeting and started a discussion.
“There’s no doubt we must use huge bricks to lay the foundation. And this time let’s try to make the tower slightly conical.”
“We should also think of the wind. What if we polish the outer bricks? It will probably weaken the force applied to the whole tower.”
“Let’s talk about the schedule. During the next ten years we will remove the bricks, and work out its design. During the following twenty years we’ll make the bricks for the foundation. And during thirty years after that the foundation will be complete. From that time onwards the tower will steadily grow higher.”
Kino spoke to the joyfully talking people:
“We are going to leave the country soon. Take care.”
And saluted them. The people waved their hands with a smile.
Kino was about to return to the inn, when a man approached and addressed her. He seemed rather impatient.
“Can you do me a favor?!” he said, as if clinging to her. Kino asked what he wants.
“Please take me with you!” said the man.
Kino asked him why, and the man replied:
“I’m fed up with this country. To build a tower just to see it collapse at some point — it’s absurd.”
“……”
“Miss traveler, perhaps you also think that our country is really strange and that we are mad. Please tell me frankly what you think!”
Kino answered honestly:
“I have no idea. I don’t know if it’s everyone who is mad or just you.”
The man made a tearful face and asked Kino:
“I beg you, take me with you. I don’t want to live in this country. Help me!”
Kino said that it wasn’t possible. The man tried to forcefully persuade her. He said that if she doesn’t want to get a painful experience, then— But Kino interrupted and said that in this case they both would be in trouble, and showed him a persuader under her coat.
The man flopped down and burst into tears.
“I’m fed up with such a life…. There’s no freedom in this country. If you are against the construction of the tower, then, being a traitor, you’ll become a human pillar[1]. What am I supposed to do…”
Kino asked Hermes what “human pillar” means. He explained it simply, and Kino said, “I see.”
The man continued to shed tears:
“I don’t want to build this tower my whole life. I’d like to do something different than that. But there’s no freedom in this country. I want liberty.”
Kino glanced at Hermes and then whispered to the man’s ear:
“If you don’t want to build the tower, just do something else; for example you can make carvings on the bricks. In that case you’ll be able to make a great number of magnificent bricks, what do you think?”
“!”
The man suddenly raised up his face. His eyes, a moment ago full of tears, opened wide.
“Of course! It’s fun! I like it! I’ll do this from now on! I can freely carve different patterns on the bricks!”


The man stood up and while joyfully hopping, rushed to the other people.
“Please listen! From now on I’ll be making carvings on the bricks! One by one, they’ll become really beautiful decorations!”
The people said unanimously:
“Whoa! Brilliant idea!”
“I agree! We can use it to decorate the stairs, for example! It’ll be so wonderful!”
“Alright, people! Let’s entrust this to him!”
The man smiled awkwardly.
Kino and Hermes left this place and returned to the inn. They loaded their luggage and left the country.


Kino’s journey is far from over, but this story ends here.















"
14,v2c9,2,9,"Kino and Hermes arrived in a small country.
At the bottom of a mountain covered with a dense forest was the expanse of a town with a modest castle in its center. One can go full-circle around the ivy-covered walls in one afternoon walk.
Kino knocked on the gates and asked the gatekeeper for permission to enter the country.
The guard, who was wearing a helmet which seemed like a traditional costume, beamed upon learning that it was Kino and Hermes’ first time to visit this country.
The guard talked to someone on the phone. From within the gates, the clanging of bells was heard.
“I alerted the whole country because it is very rare for us to have guests. It’s so that they can prepare for the welcoming party,” the guard said with a smile.
Soon the gate opened, and Kino pushed Hermes inside. Upon passing through the gates, a great number of the citizens came to receive them.
“……” “……”
Both Kino and Hermes fell silent.
The citizens were wearing ‘ears’ on their heads. A pair of ears was sticking out of their hair, symmetrically positioned on both sides. The neatly triangular-shaped ears were exactly like a cat’s.
“Welcome! Traveler and motorrad, welcome to our country!”
A representative of the citizens said this and shook hands with Kino. It was a man in the prime of his life who seemed to be the leader. Above his smiling face and firmly hardened hair, dark brown ‘cat ears’ were attached.


Kino and Hermes introduced themselves, and the man with the dark brown cat ears, who was the country’s ruler, guided them to the castle which was being used as his office.
As soon as a female secretary with purple cat ears left after serving tea, the man gave a simple explanation about the country.
A long, long time ago, a town was built around a castle which a certain royal family used as a summer vacation house. After that royal family perished, the citizens continued to thrive on the land.
The population was small but they lived in utter peace. And—— it was a tradition from those times for the citizens to wear cat ears on their heads.
“The sweet nature of a person is drawn out by using these. No matter how furiously angry someone is, once we flick these ears, his anger would dissipate as if by magic, and a smile would cross his face. People long ago must have thought of this as a means of making harmonious human relations. It’s a wonderful tradition,” the man said warmly while shaking his ears.
With very few and rare exceptions, such as changing one’s hairstyle or replacing them as one grows older, the citizens were always required to wear the cat ears on their heads.
There was an ancient-looking oil painting decorating the wall, featuring a gracefully smiling naked woman wearing cat ears.
The man asked, “Miss Kino, as you are our long-awaited guest, why don’t you try and experience our country’s tradition?”
“What do you mean?” Kino replied.
The man took out a box the size of a dictionary from under the table. He opened it and showed its contents to Kino. Inside was a set of chic black ears.
“I’ll lend these to you, Miss Kino. We thought you’d feel ill at ease if everyone except for you were wearing cat ears. Won’t you wear them while you’re here? It has the same color as your hair, Miss Kino. I’m sure they would suit you well. Of course, you are not obliged to, but…”


“You should have agreed to wear the ears if it’s just for today. That man yesterday really looked dejected you know,” said Hermes.
It was early in the afternoon of the second day. Kino was pushing along Hermes as they slowly toured the narrow townscape. All of their luggage was left in the room which they received for free. But for the time being, Kino was holding the cat ears she was given the previous day.
Children waved their hands when they saw Kino and Hermes. All of them were wearing cat ears of various colors.  The ears swayed cutely as they shook their heads.
“Aren’t you going to wear the ears, miss traveler?” they asked innocently.
In the shop where they had their meal and tea,
“Oh my—, you have a pretty face. But everyone becomes prettier when they have the ears on, you know,” a nice-figured waitress wearing wide ears said rather regretfully.
When they visited the castle, a small child pointed his finger.
“Mommy. That person is not wearing ears. She’s so weird—”
The mother spoke to the child. ‘That person is a traveler. She was born in a different country, so she is a bit different from us. She doesn’t have to wear ears,’ she gently scolded.
Along the road, a middle-aged woman spoke to Kino. ‘If you wear the cat ears, I’m sure you will be popular with boys,’ she said.
“For some reason, the ears suit anyone, and the charm of the person wearing them changes. When I was young, there was a research saying that in order for you to look your best, you should look at the mirror everyday,” and she furtively informed her to try this secret.


That night.
They opened the welcoming festival for the traveler. Soon they announced the start of the traditional cat-ear dance for the citizens. The people made a circle, bent their hands like cat paws, and hopped with the rhythmical music.
Kino who was looking on comfortably, was also invited to wear ears and to participate in the dance.
“People often say that I don’t have any talent for dancing. I would just end up stepping on everybody’s feet,” Kino politely refused. And then she added,
“Even so, it’s a wonderful dance. I was deeply moved. I’m glad I came here.”


The next morning.
Kino and Hermes set off after the cat-eared citizens bid them farewell.
When the traveler was already out of sight, the leader removed the dark brown cat ears from his head with a somewhat regretful look on his face. The other citizens removed their own cat ears as well while the crowd dissolved.
The female secretary beside the man came and took his ears and removed her own. She put them in a basket with the words ‘Collection Box’ written on it.
The woman spoke to the man who still looked disappointed. “It’s no good, huh? She didn’t join in.”
“Yeah, it’s no good…. Ring the bell to announce that it’s over.”
“I’ve arranged for it.”
“With this, we already have 549 wins and 233 losses. In my tenure, we had 3 wins and 8 losses…. The travelers we had for several years must have circulated rumors about this country to several others.”
“Indeed.”
“Well, that’s that. Now, what do we do next time? We should decide quickly, or else we won’t be able to prepare and practice. We have to change the painting too——”


A motorrad was running along a road in the forest.
“Cat ears…, I didn’t see that coming. Everyone was cute to some extent. I cannot count the number of times I had to stop myself from laughing, you know. That dance was really amusing too,” Kino said with a smile.
“It would be amusing if you wore them too, Kino. I’m sure they would suit you very well.”
“Well, whatever. Riding with lies is something I’m not good at, after all.”
And then, with an extremely serious tone,
“They did not show the slightest bit of a character’s element of surprise, even if it’s for the spirit of service, don’t you think Kino?”
“What’s that about…? But they sure don’t run out of ideas. I only heard this but…, it was said that they also wore turtle shells on their backs, attached lion tails on their bottoms, imitated how crows walk, used an intense dance as a greeting, cry suddenly while greeting, ate while they sang…. What will they do next?”
“Decorate their heads with crow feathers, enter a room hopping with their right leg, eat while their left hand is pointing at the sky, put on white make-up around their eyes, greet with thumbs up and say ‘Yay!’, maybe?”
“Yeah, that’s it. I too won’t give any spoilers to the travelers we meet. Everyone will be happy if they get to drag someone to their tradition.”
“Jeez…, there’s one over here too,” [2] Hermes said with an upset expression to the very relaxed Kino.


“——Now that I think about it, that traveler which came half a year ago was a nice one,” the leader suddenly muttered in his office.
“Hmm? Oh yeah. That time, it was the ‘putting an apple on your head’ tradition. Really, he did it right away. He also joined in on the apple dance,” the secretary replied, and the man, while looking at the ceiling,
“There were no others who were as polite and as earnest. He even said, ‘This tradition is great’. He must have been raised very well…. Ah, I wish more people like that would come,” he said with profound emotion.
The secretary slightly smiled as she remembered that time.
And spoke.
“Indeed, it was a guy wearing a green sweater who came riding a buggy, wasn’t it?”















"
15,v2c10,2,10,"“Step right up! Welcome to our country, traveler!” The guard said this with genuine enthusiasm.
“These are some questions we ask people entering the country. Please answer them. It’s nothing serious; just write the first thing that you think of.”
By himself, the guard was waiting inside a small post in front of the gates of the tall castle walls. As soon as the traveler arrived, he immediately presented a thick packet of papers. A pen too.
The traveler was slightly taken aback and stared at the papers.
The traveler was in her teens. She had short, black, unkempt hair, but her face with its big eyes had a fearless look. Goggles hung from her neck.
She wore a black jacket and a wide belt with some pouches around her waist. On her right thigh, there was a holster for a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol). Inside was a revolver with an octagonal barrel.
The traveler asked the guard, “Just me is okay? He is also going to be entering.”
The traveler then pointed with her thumb to a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) parked behind her. It was heavily loaded with a bag, a sleeping bag, and traveling luggage.
“Just you is fine. Let’s see… what was your name?”
“Kino,” the traveler Kino spoke, then pointed once again to the motorrad.
“Over there is my partner, Hermes.”
“Pleased to meet you,” the motorrad named Hermes greeted from a distance. The guard bowed in greeting.
“Again, welcome to our country. As for the questionnaire, Miss Kino would be good enough. It may take some time, but if you can please try to answer everything. You may use the chair and table over here.”
“Okay but… is this really a requirement for entering the country?” confirmed Kino.
“That is correct,” the guard nodded firmly.
Kino said she understood, sat on the chair, and began looking through the stack of papers.
It asked things like name, age, sex, height, and weight. Then it asked about hobbies, favorite foods, favorite colors, tastes in music, self-conscious qualities, thinking style, and clothing preferences.
Then it asked what you can see in a picture that looked like an ink spill; what kind of animal would you rather be; how you feel about watching boxing; what you think about farm work; whether you like children; wake up early; like raising pets; tend to cry when watching a play or reading a story; prefer cats or dogs; dream in color; worry about being judged by others; mind living together with elderly people; like gambling, and so on.
“…Sigh”
Although Kino sighed several times the whole time, she was able to answer all of the questions. Then she returned it to the waiting guard with a smile.
Afterwards, the guard took Kino’s picture, as it was necessary to complete the inspection papers. He took one frontal bust shot and one full body shot. She was asked to smile, but no matter how you looked at it, she had a sour look on her face.
“Okay, thank you very much.”
Finally, she was granted an entry permit, and the thick and heavy gates were opened. Kino tapped awake Hermes, who was soundly sleeping.
It was nearly sunset by the time Kino entered the country. To make matters worse, dark clouds had started to form. Kino looked for a cheap hotel and went in. Before long, it was raining. Kino gave up on going out for the day. She ate a meal, took a shower, and went to bed.


The next day, Kino woke at dawn break.
The rain had let up. Kino did some light exercises in her room, and then practiced with her persuader called ‘Canon’.
After having her breakfast in the hotel, Kino tapped Hermes awake. She left her luggage to the care of the hotel and decided to go out for some sightseeing.
It was not a very big country. Castle walls surrounded the level land. The streets were neatly divided and lined up abundantly with plain concrete buildings that didn’t seem to have any history.
“It’s not a very pretty country, is it?” said Hermes.
Kino asked people walking down the street about the country’s highlights. The replies were about the same.
“What a traveler would find interesting, eh…. Well, it’s a very safe country.”
“….That’s a tough question, but if I had to say then…. That really is a tough question.”
“The alcohol is great, I suppose. Hmm? You don’t drink? Then there’s nothing really special…”
“There’s none. This is a new country, so it’s not very good for sightseeing.”
Kino rode Hermes around randomly. Eventually, they reached the edge of the country and turned back.
Kino decided to stop by an open street café for some tea. As she finished her break and returned to the sidewalk where Hermes was parked, Kino heard someone shouting.
Kino and Hermes turned towards the voices. In front of a ramp leading to the roadway was a young couple yelling at each other. Things quickly became violent.
“What’s going on?” Kino said, surprised. Hermes who seemed to be enjoying himself spoke.
“As you can see, it’s a street fight. If I had to say, then the man has the advantage with the hooks he keeps on sending. But that lady’s kicks are pretty good too. Ah, that left high kick just decided it.”
“Nobody asked for a play-by-play commentary…”
“Should we stop them?”
“Hey, break it up. Let’s just talk this out,” said Kino as she approached them.
“Ah! Miss traveler, what is it you intend on doing?”
From behind, a young police officer in uniform called out to Kino and stopped her.
“You’re just in time officer,” said Hermes.
“There are people fighting. You can stop them instead,” said Kino.
The officer shook his head. “It’s probably best if we leave them be.”
“Is that really okay?”
“Yes, there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong. Besides, it looks like they’re already finished.”
When Kino looked again, she saw that the fight was settled. The couple was walking away together.
The officer warned Kino, “Miss traveler, there’s one request I have of you. Even if you see a man and a woman fighting, you must never interfere. In this country, nobody gets involved in couples or spouses who are fighting. The fights settle before becoming serious anyways.”
“That’s really how it is?” Kino asked doubtingly.
The officer smiled and said, “Even if by chance you did get involved, I’m not sure you would gain anything from it. Even so, please enjoy your visit in our country. You won’t find something like it anywhere else, and there are many good places. Now then, if you’ll excuse me.”
The officer saluted and left.
“Good places? Where?” muttered Hermes.


Kino had a satisfying lunch, then she refilled Hermes' fuel tank. After a short argument, they both agreed to end the day’s sightseeing and rest at the hotel.
While waiting at a stop light, a voice from the car next to them called out.
“Hello traveler!”
The driver was a man in his thirties wearing glasses and a suit with a tie.
“Miss traveler, if you like, won’t you come over to my house for some tea? I’m on my way home right now, it’s very close. What do you say? You can meet my wife too; we’d love to talk with you about traveling and our country.”
“We’re free now so why not?” said Hermes. Kino nodded. She told the man that they would follow his car.


The man’s house was one of two-storey apartments connected side by side.
The man’s wife came out of the entryway to greet them. She had long hair and a beautiful face.
“This is my wife. A beauty isn’t she?” The man said this quite happily then kissed his wife on the cheek.
“Please make yourselves at home, miss traveler and mister motorrad,” greeted the wife with a smile. Kino returned the greeting, and introduced herself and Hermes.
The man showed everyone in, and the wife, who had stayed behind to close the door, caught a glimpse of Canon on Kino’s right thigh. Her eyes opened wide for a moment, then she spoke quietly. “Miss traveler, you carry a persuader?”
“Hmm? Ah, if you don’t like it I will put it away,” Kino hastily said. The woman shook her head with a smile.
“Not at all, I’m fine with it as is. Traveling is dangerous isn’t it? How long will you be in this country?”
“Until tomorrow, I will probably leave in the morning,” answered Kino.
“I see…,” the woman muttered softly.


The man offered Kino a seat in the dining room. Hermes stood behind on his center stand.
The man called his wife who was in the kitchen. “Bring our guests something to drink. Thanks.”
“Of course, sorry to leave you waiting,” responded the wife with a lively tone.
The man politely spoke to Kino. “Welcome to my house. I don’t get much chance to speak with foreigners. Miss traveler, mister motorrad, what do you think of this country?”
“It’s boring,” Hermes said straightaway.
The man laughed, “Hahaha. You’re a frank one, aren’t you, mister motorrad. To tell you the truth, this country is boring. There’s no beautiful scenery or deep history to be found here. But it’s a good place. It’s peaceful and there’s little crime. We can live our lives carefreely. On my days off I always play tennis with my friends.”
The woman set down a tray and carried over a bottle and cups. It was alcohol. She filled the man’s cup to the brim. The man gave a surprised look, but quickly emptied the glass in a single gulp and let out a gasp. His face slowly began turning red. The man asked his wife by his side, “Hey, where’s the snacks?”
“Ah, sorry, hold on,” the wife said as she turned back.
At that moment, the man shouted angrily, “Why am I waiting?! It should already be out you idiot!”
The man stood up, grabbed his wife’s hair with both hands, and dragged her.
“Eek!” The woman yelped and the two of them disappeared into the next room.
The sound of something being hit was heard several times.
“Bitch! Bitch! Stupid bitch!”
The man’s shouts were heard. The slander continued.
“You fool! Be more considerate! Are you trying to embarrass me?! Are you trying to be lazy?! You think people are just going to feed you?! Hey! Are you listening? Sand!”
For a short moment, there was no noise. Then suddenly the man’s voice was heard,
“Whatever, just hurry up and cook something. Make it snappy. I’m in a good mood today so I’ll let you off with this. Now hurry up idiot!”
There was a thud. It sounded like something was dropped.
The man returned to the dining room completely red-faced. He sat down, suddenly looking rather embarrassed, and politely spoke. “I’m very sorry you had to see such an unsightly thing. She tries a little harder every time, but she can’t help being a fool. Please don’t take it against her, and if you can, please forgive her. Ah, that’s right, miss traveler, how about a drink?”
“No, thank you, I don’t drink,” Kino said. Her expression has not changed from before.
“Ah, well would you like one of these?” The man offered the biscuits sitting on a small plate on the table.
Kino thanked the man, picked one up, and put it in her mouth. At that moment, the woman came staggering into the dining room. Her hair was a mess, and she was holding the side of her forehead. She walked towards the kitchen like a ghost.
“Bring the traveler some tea! Hurry up!” the man shouted at her back.
Staying in a good mood, the man poured himself a drink and gulped it down. He became talkative, and his tone cheery.
“Man, I’m jealous of travelers! Really jealous! They travel around, going to all sorts of places. Yep. You know, I’ve also ridden on a motorrad before. The engine had exhaust pipes on both sides…. I don’t mean to brag, but I was pretty good at it too. But, to be honest, I did fall over too. I was only borrowing it so I was only able to ride it a bit. Yep… *hic*! I wanted to go on a journey. Hey, miss traveler, traveling must be fun, eh?”
Kino gave the man a smile. “Yes, very. You can witness the various differences in each country’s customs.”
“Kino thinks so too,” Hemes muttered inaudibly.
“That’s right!”
The man slapped his knee. He wobbled as he arose from his seat and exclaimed with a smile.
“Different countries. There’s so many of them and you get to tour them. Yep. It sure is nice…. You have to do it while you’re still young! Oops!”
The man started leaning forward and lost his balance. His arm hit the wife who was carrying out the food. The woman dropped the plate, and the food completely scattered on the floor.
“Ah!” shouted the woman.
The man’s expression quickly changed. He glared at his wife with an almost demon-like rage.
“What do you mean, ‘Ah!’? Hey! Stupid! Don’t just stand there! The snacks are ruined! Ahhh! You’re useless! Trash! Pick that up and eat it!”
Kino ate another biscuit.
The man grabbed the woman’s long hair, pulled her towards himself, and dragged her off into the next room in this state.
“You stupid bitch!”
A number of slapping sounds were heard, and the man’s jeering continued.
“Seriously! You can’t even bring one snack to our guest! You’re useless, a burden to everyone! …Tsk! I can’t believe I’m even with someone like you! Say something! Hey stupid! Sand! Are you listening?”
There was silence for a moment.
“Your stupidity makes me sick! Our guests came all this way! Who do you think you should thank for the food you eat? Whose money is keeping you alive? Who’s working? Eh? …Forget it, I’m tired from work! I’m going to sleep! I want you to clean up! Make that floor sparkle! Got it?”
Then, the sound of something dropping was heard once more.
The man came back to the dining room.
“I’m very sorry to trouble you, miss traveler, mister motorrad. I’ll have to say goodnight here. I enjoyed our conversation. Please make yourselves comfortable. If you need anything, feel free to command my wife — even though she’s really useless.”
The man left these courteous words and entered the next room.
“Get to work!”
The wife was dragged back out. The spot on her forehead where she was first hit was swollen. Blood was coming out from a cut on her lip. The man flung his wife on the floor as if she were garbage.
The man disappeared into the room with shaky steps. Soon, his tottering footsteps were heard climbing up the stairs.
Kino glanced at Hermes, then stood up from her chair. Kino attempted to help the woman who was cleaning up the food that had fallen on the floor.
“It’s fine, please stop.” The woman held back Kino.
“Sorry, but it’s all right. Please return to your seat.”
“She’s right, Kino. There’s no need for you to help her pick those up.”
Hermes said from behind. Kino looked at Hermes once more and sat on the chair.
While restraining the blood spreading from her mouth, the woman picked up the scattered food and wiped the floor.
The woman cleared up the table, washed her hands in the kitchen, and wiped her face. Afterwards, she handed out a cup of tea to Kino. Kino thanked her as she received it.
“Please wait for a while.”
The woman left these words and went out of the dining room. The sound of climbing up the stairs, and then of climbing down, was heard.
The woman returned to the dining room and sat opposite of Kino. There was a conspicuous swelling above her right eye, and the blood on her lower lip had clotted.
“You must have been surprised…,” the woman opened her mouth to speak.
“Well, sort of. But you see, this morning, we saw a couple relentlessly fighting right in the middle of the street. I tried to stop them, but a police officer stopped me.”
“I see…”
“This country is just like this, isn’t it?” Hermes said, and the woman nodded once.
“Yes. In this country, it was custom and law that couples shouldn’t hold back from each other. For that reason, fighting with your spouse is not a crime as long as no one gets killed.
“……” “……”
“But this isn’t something to be surprised about. After all, it has always been like this even in olden times.”
“I see,” Kino said.
“Hey, why did you marry that kind of person anyway?” Hermes asked forthright.
The woman smiled. It was a smile of self-mockery mixed with amusement, as if she had been asked the same question many times already.
“That’s so true. If I had the choice, would I have married such a man?”
“Was he like that even before you got married?” Hermes asked further, as frank as ever.
“No, he was different. When I first met him in our ‘omiai’, I thought he was a wonderful and sincere man,” the woman said.
“What’s an ‘omiai’ [1]?” Kino asked.
“Is that the name of the restaurant where you had your first date or something?” Hermes answered, and the woman shook her head.
“An ‘omiai’ is a custom in this country, where a man and a woman who hope to get married meet for the first time. With a mediator’s help, two people of similar family backgrounds and economic status meet and talk to each other to look at the possibility of a good match. If everything goes well, the marriage will push through…”
“Then that means it’s possible to get married with a person you don’t love?” Kino asked in surprise.
“Yes, but that’s not all…. In this country, adults who don’t get married are not considered genuine grown-ups. Men should have a family to protect. Women should stay at home and take care of the household,” the woman answered.
“Hmm”
“And so everyone’s in a hurry to get married once they reach their late twenties. Perhaps they think that if they don’t get married soon, they wouldn’t be able to for the rest of their lives. They're afraid of never becoming ‘genuine adults’. During those times, there are many who were encouraged to attend an ‘omiai’.”
“I see…. But, isn’t marriage something that two people who love each other do, because they want to stay together for the rest of their lives?” Kino asked.
“Yes”
“But then, if this ‘omiai’ you’re speaking about is for choosing a partner in order to get married…, doesn’t the purpose defeat itself?”
The woman pondered for a while, then lightly nodded.
“You can probably put it that way. But miss traveler, results-wise, the means of getting a partner doesn’t have much to do with a successful married life. Things don’t always turn out well even if one marries for love, and there are cases when a couple could live happily even though their marriage was arranged through an ‘omiai’. To give you an example, my parents also met each other through an ‘omiai’, but they were able to have a happy family. I observed this as I grew up, so I looked up to my parents as my models, and it was my dream to have the same kind of family. Miss traveler, don’t you agree?”
“……”
“But in your case, you had a husband like that.”
Hermes replied while Kino fell silent.
“Yes…. Before, and for a while after we got married, we were conscious of each other’s needs, and I didn’t realize it. However, after living together for a while, we became too familiar with each other…, and it was already too late. Once, he noticed a little dust on the floor; all of a sudden, he got angry and hit me. At that time, I was too surprised to grasp what just happened, and he continued beating me.”
“Uh-huh,” Hermes interjected.
“Since then, he would become violent over the most trivial matters. Alcohol makes him even worse. He had pushed me down the stairs, pressed his cigarette on my skin…, shut me out of the house, thinly clothed, right in the middle of winter.”
“……”
“Anything else?” Hermes asked as if enjoying himself. The woman continued nonchalantly.
“He did all kinds of harsh things to me. When I told my old friend, she got angry and lectured me for a whole hour as to how something was wrong with me emotionally, and ‘how a woman should behave’ regardless of the violence you receive. Nothing was left of my belongings that I had before I got married. Everything was either thrown away or destroyed. I was keeping a cat until last year. However, while I was gone, that person threw it on the floor…; I had no choice but to kill it out of pity. That time, he was fined for being cruel to animals. But later on, he beat me and told me it was my fault for keeping a cat in the first place.”
“……”
“Uh-huh”
“All of my books and study manuals were burned. He told me there was no need for a housewife to learn anything else other than housekeeping. And so I bought books on cooking and housekeeping. Then he told me that I was hopeless no matter what I do, and threw away the books, which, according to him, were a ‘waste of money’. Ever since, I did nothing other than keeping the house. My life insurance was canceled, and I almost have nothing for my personal expenses. He told me: ‘Slaves don’t need money, you just do as I tell you.’”
“Hmm. I see, I understand it very well,” Hermes said with an awed tone. The woman continued.
“Even so, after behaving so violently, the next morning he would be on his knees, crying and apologizing. I would also cry and think, ‘Oh, this person is really gentle, deep inside,’ and I would forgive him for everything. But it would happen again and again. For a while after, he wouldn’t act terribly and would be kind. I would be constantly worried as to when he would be angry from my incompetence and inexperience as a wife. Perhaps, it was his weakness as a human, and I’m the only one who could help him with it — maybe it was my mission. Such thoughts crossed my mind,” the woman said and laughed.
“Uhm, can’t you file for divorce?” Kino asked. The woman had an expression more sorrowful than when she was being beaten.
“So you weren’t aware of it, huh…. What am I saying, of course a traveler wouldn’t know, I’m sorry. In this country, divorce is considered lowly, and no one approves of it. Either way, the only other means to end your marriage is to die.”
“Oh, dear. Religion?”
“No. It’s just a widely accepted view, I suppose. It seems they decided a long time ago that there is nothing more disgraceful than divorce. A divorced person was not able to protect his family, and hence he’s an inadequate member of society, a useless person. To avoid having such people, divorce was completely banned.
“…I see,” Kino muttered in a lifeless voice and glimpsed at Hermes.
As Kino was about to say something,
“Miss traveler,” the woman faced Kino with her lightly bruised face and spoke with a forceful tone.
“I have one request of you…”
Kino looked back at the wife. She returned a silent gaze.
“What is it? Is it something that I can do?”
“Yes. Only you can do it, miss traveler. You can get me out of my trouble. I’m willing to thank you to the best of my ability. It doesn’t matter to me even if you take everything of use to you in this house. My request has something to do with my husband…”
“I think I know what’s coming,” Hermes said.
“What is it?” Kino asked.
The woman looked back once and confirmed that there was nobody else. She made a brooding expression, and, with a low but clear voice, she spoke to Kino.
“Miss traveler, with that persuader, I want you to kill my husband.”
“Okay! She’ll do it!” was Hermes quick and cheerful reply.
“I’m sorry, please ignore what this guy says for a while,” Kino corrected.
The woman’s expression did not change. She looked at Kino.
“Please. He’s sleeping right now. I have the key to his bedroom.”
Kino lightly shook her head and spoke. “To make things short, it’s not possible. I can’t do this for you.”
“Oh, you won’t?” Hermes asked in a light tone.
“Of course not. That’s murder you know,” Kino said, and Hermes replied with a somewhat repulsive tone.
“Kino, don’t you remember how many people you have shot down until now? It’s not like you have ‘persuading powers’.”
“The circumstances are different. In this case, I can be punished by this country’s laws. That’s what I mean by murder. I don’t want to go to jail here.”
“Well, whatever—. What does this wife’s circumstances have to do with you, as long as you don’t die and continue to travel, Kino. Now that I think about it, it’s none of your business,” Hermes spoke with much sarcasm.
“Uh, uhm…” the woman shyly interjected and spoke firmly,
“You don’t have to worry about that. You are not going to be charged with murder.”
Kino looked as if she has just woken up in the middle of the day.
“What do you mean?”
“It’s the law. In this country, even if a person from outside the country commits a crime, if he gets out of the country within the day, no crime could be charged against him. As to why…. Well, originally, the police would desperately chase after the culprit. However, they couldn’t arrest them once they have escaped outside the country. To avoid people criticizing the police’s incompetence, they made a law that dismisses any illegal act committed by a foreigner. That is why no matter how many people you kill here today, you can walk out of the gates tomorrow morning without any problems.”
“……”
“But,”
Hermes tried to speak while Kino remained silent.
The woman continued. “I’m sure the reason for the rigorous check at the gates is this law. However, if they found out that I told you about this, I will be punished…, even so, I don’t care.”
Kino thought for a while, then said, “…Can I ask you one… no, two questions?”
“Go ahead.”
“If in case you could no longer stand your husband’s violence, and you killed him, what will be your punishment?”
“Death penalty. A person who kills his spouse will be charged with first-degree murder and will definitely be sentenced to death. Because the violence between husband and wife is acceptable and is not a crime, I have no legal motive to kill my husband.”
“…….. My other question may be a bit strange. When your husband said ‘sand’, what exactly does he mean?”
The woman smiled and answered, “He meant ‘sandbag’. You can see for yourself the reason for that name.”
“……”
“But… Kino, are you listening to me?” Hermes asked.
“I am.”
The woman looked at Kino pleadingly, with almost a worshipping expression.
“I beg you…, please…”
“What will you do, Kino?”
Kino stood up. She looked at her right thigh towards Canon, which was loaded with six bullets. And then she spoke.
“Let’s go back, Hermes.”
“I knew it.”
At the same time as Hermes’ short answer, the woman’s face was filled with a look of disbelief. She kicked the chair away as she stood up and clung to Kino’s leg.
“No way! I beg you! I cannot stand this sort of life anymore! You saw it yourself! You saw it, didn’t you?! I was being completely battered! Miss traveler! There’s no other way! Don’t you see?! This is my first and final chance! I have endured until now for a chance like this! Can you hear me?!”
“We’ll be… leaving,” Kino slowly and gently removed the hands of the pleading woman.
She removed Hermes’ stand and started to push him towards the entrance.
“I beg you…. Please…”
As Kino passed through the door, she turned to the woman who has broken down crying on the floor.
“Thank you for the cookies.”
She then faced the woman whose tears was flowing down her big, gaping eyes, and finally said,
“I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be a God.”


Kino and Hermes went out to the street from the apartment complex.
“I don’t feel well,” Kino said shortly.
Hermes spoke, as if consoling Kino. “I understand how you feel, Kino. But this country has to solve its issues by itself. No matter what a traveler says or does, the people will still stick with their own rules. Madeline said so.”
“Who? …You mean, meddlesome? [2]
“Yeah, that,” Hermes said and fell silent.
“It’s just as you say, Hermes. I understand that… all the more.”
“I sympathize with you. Kino, you’ll feel better if you eat something sweet. Ah, I just know.”
Kino sighed. “I’ll do that. I wonder if they have something in that café we went to in the morning…”
Kino started Hermes’ engine. She put on her hat and goggles, and rode through the street.
“Kino, I thought you noticed, but…,” Hermes said hesitantly while they were riding.
Kino nodded. “Yeah. I didn’t say anything, but this morning, she brought out a strong alcohol and let that dish drop on purpose. …I saw it.”
“That was some fine acting. I was deeply moved.”
“Indeed…. There really are different types of people.”


“Hey there, miss traveler.”
The police officer they met that morning called out to Kino and Hermes. He was leisurely standing in front of the open street café, which was just closing shop. Kino straightened her hat with a dejected face.
Without responding, Kino approached the police officer. There was a strange expression on her face as she walked past the right side of the officer, completely ignoring him.
At that moment, Kino reached for the holster on the man’s hip with her right hand, and drew out the hand persuader.
The policeman noticed immediately, but at the same time, he felt something pushing against his back and froze. Soon he heard a voice by his ear.
“Please don’t move. You don’t have to raise your hands.”
“M-miss traveler? W-w-w-w-what’s the meaning of this?”
“Nothing. However, if I pull this trigger, something really bad will happen, right? But it’s permissible. By the way, I’ll be leaving tomorrow morning.”
The police officer became speechless for a moment. And then he spoke slowly.
“…F-from who did you hear about this? Rather, who told you? Will you tell me? I-I would really appreciate it if you do, and let me r-report it to the headquarters.”
Hermes poked fun at the officer. “Kino, this person sure is dedicated to his work. How wonderful. You have my respect. You should be promoted two ranks.”
Kino spoke, her tone not different from usual. “It doesn’t mean that someone told me. I tortured someone, and he confessed to me. He told me that if I leave tomorrow, anything I do here today wouldn’t be considered a crime.”
“……”
“Now, can I shoot?”
“…U-uhm, well…no. I have a wife that I love. I’m saying the truth. I don’t want to die yet.”
“…I see. Then, I’ll be returning this,” Kino said and returned the persuader inside its holster.
The surprised police officer turned around and took a relieved breath as he saw that what was pointed on his back was only Kino’s finger. He shook his head many times and took in one more mouthful of air.
After a while, Kino spoke. “That’s one weird law, you know.”
Even though he was staring at Kino somewhat sullenly, the police officer answered with a polite tone,
“I agree. To tell you the truth, I was just thinking yesterday how that law should be revised.”
“I totally approve. We might have been tempted to do something, you see.”
“Over-speeding, theft, kidnap for ransom, running away without paying for food…”
Kino and Hermes happily enumerated, and the police officer took one more deep breath.
“Don’t worry. We’ll definitely be gone by tomorrow. We won’t do anything. Also, I promise not to tell about this to anybody. …By the way, there’s just one question I would like to ask.”
“…What is it?”
“’Whatever happens between a married couple wouldn’t be considered a crime.’ Have there been any plans or moves to amend that law?” Kino asked.
“What for?” the police officer said and made an expression as if he didn’t completely understand what she meant.
“There’s no need for that to be changed, is there?” the officer said clearly.
“But look here, mister policeman. Is it really acceptable to hit your partner for whatever reason?” Hermes asked immediately.
“Yes”
“You mean, it doesn’t bother you?” Kino asked, and the policeman muttered a small ‘yes’. And then slowly, as though he was lecturing a child in the street, he spoke to Kino and Hermes.
“If it’s just that, then there should be no problems. They’re a married couple, you see.”
“……” “……”
“In any country, spats between married couples are unavoidable. It’s impossible to get rid of that, and it’s unreasonable for the police to intervene in such matters.”
“Even in cases of abuse?”
The police officer gave a slight nod to Kino’s question.
“Yes. Well, I suppose you can call it ‘abuse’ if one continues to win in a couple’s fight. Even so, the police cannot interfere because that is a problem between husband and wife. No matter what, an outsider should not intervene with the problems of a couple; it wouldn’t make any difference. That’s called being meddlesome.”
“Being meddlesome, it is,” Hermes said.
“Each person has the right and duty to choose how he should live. A couple was bound by marriage to cooperate with each other forever, in times of pain and illness; sharing the joys and sorrows fate would grant them; to live under one roof and look after each other. A stranger, much less the law, has no business restricting what a couple should do. Rather, nothing in this world should restrict them.
“……”
“I’ve mentioned it earlier, haven’t I? I’m married. That’s why I understand. A couple is closest to each other and loves each other the most because they live together. Still, disputes between them are inevitable. I’ve said it a lot of times now, but whatever their problems may be, they have to resolve it on their own. And with that, their relationship becomes even deeper.”
“Really?” Kino asked very doubtfully.
“Miss traveler, you would understand this once you get married. At that time, you would say, ‘Ah, so it was really like this, eh?’”
“……”
“I see,” Hermes muttered.
“Kino, how are you feeling? Are you in the mood to shoot someone?”
The police officer twitched and stiffened for a moment.
“Eh?! …Uhm”
Kino lightly tapped Canon on her right thigh and glanced at the police officer she threatened. Then she spoke with a completely detached expression.
“Not really…”
The sigh of the police officer was heard. At the same time, Kino glowered at him.
Once again, he stiffened under Kino’s stare. As she sent him sharp glares, she asked,
“I’m looking for a shop selling sweets. Is there one around here?”


Evening. Kino had already gone to bed.
In the house Kino visited in the morning, the man has woken up and went down to the dining room. He ordered his wife, who was sleeping prostrate on the table, to cook something.
The wife asked what he wanted to eat.
“Anything you make’s fine. It would be as bad as pig slop, anyway,” the man said gently.
The woman cut meat in the kitchen and made some steak. She then carried the dish to the dining room, still in the frying pan.
The woman spoke gently to the man who was seated in front of his plate.
“You know dear, there’s something I realized today.”
The man replied disinterestedly. “What is it, sandbag?”
The woman smiled, her eyes deep red from weeping out.
“In this world, there’s no such thing as a God or a Buddha. Therefore, there’s no such thing as miracles. Humans should solve their problems with their own hands. Then that means…. I was mistaken. I thought… even though I don’t make any effort, everything that I wish for will go my own way…. I thought that someday, a kind fairy godmother would appear out of nowhere and grant my wishes…. My father and my mother, even though they did nothing to each other, it doesn’t mean their relationship was always great. Probably…. No, I’m sure it’s like that.”
“Hmph. You’re a hopeless idiot as usual. Quit saying useless things and serve me quick. Bring some alcohol too. I have to do some exercise after my meal so stay right there, sandbag. Idiot. Trash,” the man said. The woman remained standing, holding the sizzling frying pan in her hands.
“Hurry up. Or do you want me to hit you right now?”
The man spoke without looking at his wife’s face. Even so, the woman remained standing dazedly, thinking about something. The man raised an irritated voice.
“Hey!”
Even so, the woman remained standing.
At last, the man kicked the chair and stood up.
Soon a scream was heard from the dining room of a house. It was a long, high-pitched scream. It resounded in the neighborhood, but nobody paid attention.


The next day. The morning of the third day since Kino entered the country.
When Hermes woke up, Kino has finished loading all of her luggage.
“Ah, good morning. Are we leaving already?”
Kino answered Hermes’ question while wiping the lens of her goggles.
“Yeah. Even if we stayed any longer, there wouldn’t be anything interesting here. …It’s a dull country.””
Kino rode Hermes towards the western gate.
‘What are you going to do?’ Hermes asked Kino along the way.
“Let’s leave things as is. There’s nothing much that person can do anyway.”
“Maybe so, but the same goes for you.”
Upon arriving in front of the gates, Kino stopped Hermes. She cut the engine and got off. As she started to push Hermes into the gate,
“Miss traveler!”
Kino looked back. The woman she met yesterday was smiling and waving from a car slightly far away.
The woman drove the car and stopped near Kino and Hermes.
The woman quickly got out of the car and stood in front of Kino and Hermes. The bruise on her forehead was still distinctly blue in color, but she had a bright expression.
“Good morning. I came to see you off. I’m glad I caught up with you.”
“Thank you…. Good morning,” Kino returned the greeting with a complex expression. Still smiling, the woman tapped the car from the outside.
“Look, dear. Let’s bid miss traveler farewell together. Quickly now.”
The woman’s husband slowly emerged from the car.
A net was covering the man’s head, the side of his head was wrapped in bandages, and his left arm was in a cast hanging from his neck.
“W-what happened?” Kino asked. The man did not answer. The woman laughed, slightly embarrassed.
“Well, last night, you see…” was her only answer. And then she hit her husband’s shoulder.
The man twitched and his body shook. As he stood silently, the woman from behind asked.
“Dear. Aren’t you going to greet miss traveler here?”
“Ah, yeah…. Hey…, g-good morning…,” the man chirped. The woman took out a stick from the car seat. It was a rolling pin used in kneading dough for a pie.
With this, the woman hit her husband’s back.
“Agh!” the man shrieked and twisted his body. The woman continued and hit the helpless man’s back seven times.
“What’s with that tiny voice? Give her a proper greeting.”
“I-I’m sorry,” were the only words the man managed to say. The woman bent over and hit her husband’s thigh strongly with the rolling pin. The man collapsed. He fell on his left arm and gave a shriek.
Like before, Kino just looked on without changing her expression.
Ignoring the man groveling on the ground, the woman tried to say something to Kino. At that time,
“Hey, miss traveler! Are you leaving already?” A loud voice called from afar. It belonged to the uniformed police officer Kino threatened the previous day. He approached Kino with a quick gait.
“Hello there. We meet again. It seems you’re going out of the country. Did you enjoy your stay?” the policeman asked with a smile. Kino answered with a yes, and Hermes retorted,
“Very much. By the way, I see you’ve been tailing us since morning. You’re not very good at it are you?”
The policeman narrowed his eyes for a moment. Then he replied awkwardly, “A-ah, well…, so you noticed, eh? I’m sorry, but this is part of my job…. I am dedicated to my work, after all.”
“Ah, well that’s funny,” Hermes said, and they both laughed.
In the midst of this cheerful atmosphere,
“P-please help me!”
The man suddenly got up and shouted. He clung to the police officer’s foot with his right arm.
“O-officer! You’re just in time! H-help me! T-this woman is heartlessly beating me!”
The policeman looked gloomily at the man. Then he turned his face to the woman.
“Yes. He’s my husband,” the woman said.
“S-s-save me! I beg you! Protect me! I’m going to get killed!”
“Please calm down, mister.”
The police officer slowly and gently removed the man’s hand.
The woman slowly got closer to her husband’s face and spoke with a gentle smile.
“Don’t worry, dear. I am not going to kill you.”
“Eep!” The man drew back as if trying to escape.
“I know about vital spots. You do realize that I took medicine when I was not yet married, don’t you?”
“See, your wife said it herself. Mister, you have to pull yourself together,” the officer said, and the man pointed at the bandages on the side of his head.
“Just look at the wounds she gave me yesterday! Last night she struck me with a sizzling frying pan without warning! After that, while I was collapsed, she recklessly hit me with a chair and broke the bones in my left arm! Look!”
“So that was the aftermath of your fight, eh? How unmanly of you!” the police officer said, making a small triumphant pose. An old man with an old woman who seemed to be his wife, snickered as they passed through.
“No way…,” the man muttered. Immediately, the wife’s kick connected with his flank.
“Guh!” the man bent and pressed down on his flank. He collapsed and became quiet.
The woman bowed to the police officer several times. “I’m really sorry, officer. We’re causing you trouble.”
“Nope, it’s okay. My job is to protect everybody’s safety. Do not hesitate to approach me for the slightest concern… is what I would like to say. But the truth is there’s so little crime around that I have so much free time,” the police officer said as he saluted and winked.
“Well,” the woman gave a slightly surprised smile.
“Help me…. Please, I’ll get killed…. Officer…,” a weak voice was heard.
With a disappointed look on his face, the police officer squatted down and spoke to the man groaning on his side.
“Ok, ok. Mister, police officers do not have that much free time, you know. Please stop this notion of you getting killed. You should get along with your wife. If there’s any problem, you should solve it together. You are a married couple, after all.”
The police officer stood up, turned to Kino and Hermes, and saluted respectfully.
“Miss traveler, I’ll have to excuse myself now. I apologize for tailing you. However, I truly thank you for staying here. I’ll be leaving you to the care of the gate sentry. Oh, that store’s root beer float was delicious, wasn’t it?”
Kino lightly bowed her head. “Yes, thank you for everything.”
“You’re welcome,” the police officer said and walked away.
When the police officer could no longer be seen, the woman spoke to Kino and Hermes.
“Miss traveler, I wanted to thank you. That’s why I wanted to see you.”
“You wanted… to thank… me?”
The woman narrowed her eyes. “Yes. Yesterday, at that time, you did the right thing. Thank you.”
“……”
“Because this is my… no, our problem, we have to solve it by ourselves, right? I already quit waiting for God. From here on, I will seize my happiness with my own hands. I will do my best to live honestly. Oh, right! I wanted to give you something as a souvenir to remind you of this country. I’ll take it and return here immediately, so wait here okay?”
The woman squatted, pulled her husband’s ear and brought it close to her mouth.
“Dear, I’ll be back soon. Don’t do anything stupid in front of miss traveler.”
“……”
“Answer me!”
The man’s face crumpled as his wife suddenly shouted in his ear.
“…Y-yes. I understand.”
“Ah, hand me your wallet. I’ll hold onto it from now on. I can’t let you have excess stuff. Understand?”
“…Yes”
The moment the man said this, the woman let go of his ear. The man’s head fell on the road with a blunt sound. His eyeglasses fell off.
The woman took out a wallet from the man’s breast pocket. She lightly sauntered to a nearby store and went inside.
With the same expressionless face, Kino looked on as the man slowly raised himself up.
The man sat up. Blood seeped out of the bandages from his head. He looked up at Kino with a pleading, almost worshipping expression.
“M-miss traveler…. I-I have one request,” the man spoke feebly.
“What is it?”
“C-can you kill that?”
“What do you mean by ‘that’?”
Kino asked with an extremely normal tone. The man spoke wildly while his head trembled.
“My wife! I-It’s only in this country… where there’s a law that if you’re a traveler, anything you do won’t be held against you as long as you leave immediately. B-but, if they found out that I told this to you, I will be punished…, even so, I don’t care! S-so please, with that persuader, shoot my wife to death! I’ll do anything to thank you!”
“But… what are you going to do, Kino?”
“I refuse.”
The man looked as if he was about to cry at Kino’s reply. Soon, he really did burst into tears.
While hanging his head and sobbing bitterly, the man muttered.
“…W-why do I have to suffer like this…? Why…? I don’t understand at all. Have I done anything to her for her to treat me like this? Is there any reason why my wife would suddenly become violent and attack her husband like this?”
“I don’t know. I’m single, so I don’t understand,” Kino said.
‘Ah,’ the man muttered softly. He sniffled several times.
“…Until now, I did a fine job supporting my family. I did all that I can to do what was expected of a husband. I dismissed socializing with others, came home from work early…, set aside some time for conversation with her, stayed with her during holidays. I even had the same hobbies as her.”
“……” “……”
“Of course, she was pretty demanding…, but I tried my best to do everything for her, even if I had to make sacrifices… because I was aiming for a harmonious married life. And so…, I thought she would be very happy… Why, why did it turn out like this…? There’s something utterly wrong with her since yesterday. Maybe I should have her checked in the hospital even if she’s against it? Ah…”
“Until yesterday, was there anything your wife should be angry about?” Kino asked.
“I don’t know…. I couldn’t think of anything…”
“Like punching her all of a sudden or something?”
The man slightly raised his head to Hermes’ question. He became slightly garrulous.
“Well that’s…, whenever my wife makes a mistake, I would hit her, but since she’s a woman, I go easy on her. If that’s——”
The man’s upper body suddenly collapsed.
“Aagh!”
His eyeglasses flew away. The man’s face was scraped on the road. The woman who just came back pitilessly kicked away the man’s right arm.
The woman ignored her husband and handed a tiny paper bag to Kino.
“Here. A souvenir from this country. Open it.”
Kino looked inside. Carved on a tiny iron plate was a pair of water birds that resembled wild ducks nestled close together. She showed it to Hermes.
“It’s a charm. I thought a big one would be a bother to take with you.”
“Thank you very much. What kind of charm is this?” Kino asked, and the woman answered with a smile.
“It’s for a happy marriage. These are called ‘Mandarins’. It is said that these birds live their whole life with the same partner. A long time ago, married couples with good relationships were called ‘Mandarin couples’ [3]. Someday, somewhere, I wish that you would find a wonderful partner, miss traveler.”
“……. Thank you… very much.”
With an indescribable expression on her face, Kino thanked the woman. And then, she pushed Hermes into the gates. She looked back once and saw the woman striking the man several times.


“Tadah! Look here, please!”
The sentry cheerfully greeted and showed a panel to Kino across the ticket window of the guard post. Over there were photos of several men with general profiles written underneath.
“What… is this?” Kino asked.
“Listen well! This is something originally developed in our country. A historical couple compatibility diagnostic method we call the ‘Perfect Matching Method’. After our calculations, we produced a list of men which would be perfect husband-material for Miss Kino!”
“What?”
“Let me see! Let me see!” Hermes said energetically, and the sentry changed the angle a little for Hermes to see.
“When you entered the country, you answered a questionnaire, didn’t you? With that, we determined Miss Kino’s hereditary disposition and judged based on different possibilities. On top of that, we’ve chosen men from our country who are perfectly compatible with Miss Kino’s values, way of living, thinking, attributes, and feelings!”
“What for?”
The guard grinned. “It’s only in this country. If you agree to have an interview with these men, you will be given permission to stay in our country for one month. And if you decide to marry one of them, we will grant you citizenship unconditionally.”
“……” “That’s amazing!”
Kino kept silent while Hermes gleefully exclaimed.
“Isn’t it? Wow, you are so lucky, Miss Kino. You dropped in during our campaign period, purely by chance. This is such a great opportunity, don’t you think? I doubt you’ll have a chance like this elsewhere. There are few chances for you to get to know someone wonderful during your travels, right?”
“True, true! That’s spot on. Kino seldom meets anyone. On rare occasions, they would either be shot to death or would escape frazzled all over. It’s really thrilling to watch from below, you know.” Hermes was truly enjoying this. The sentry continued.
“How about it, Miss Kino? According to our data, 67% of single men and 82% of single women think that marriage will make them happy. However, only 43% of men and 29% of women think that they will meet someone even if they don’t do anything. Maybe you have to take one more look at your life, and try it out for the time being? We have data for thousands of men, and among these, we can send you about fifty files to peruse every week. We also sponsor wonderful get-together parties twice a week. Moreover, the government runs this system, so the national assembly hall can be used as the reception hall! There is live music from the national orchestra, and from time to time, the state leader even comes to give a speech!”
“……”
“What do you think? There was a scholar who said that humans are animals who live to support each other. There was also a poet who left the words, ‘Marriage is the least and last form of human interaction.’ He also said this: ‘Marriage is half pain and twice the pleasure.’”
“……”
“Don’t you think people who are not married and talk about life are mistaken? Marriage is the goal of a human’s existence, and marriage is just the beginning of a person’s life. Everything that you do in your life before that is just in preparation for marriage. It’s just a rehearsal, you know?”
“……”
“Miss Kino, you’re still young, but if you take your time, you will be an old maid in no time! So now! Sign this contract immediately and find a wonderful partner in our country!”
Kino poked her finger on the man’s head, who slowly raised his face. And then,
“Don’t you know? Anything I do here wouldn’t be considered a crime,” she threatened in a whisper.
“Have a nice trip—!” The guard gave her a refreshing smile and said this energetically. Then he closed the guard post’s shutters in an instant.
“……”
While shaking her head several times, she climbed on Hermes and started the engine. She strapped her goggles on.
“Let’s go, Hermes.”
“Is it okay if you don’t get married?” Hermes teased.
“Traveling is much safer,” Kino answered.
“I guess so.”
While riding away, Kino looked back at the towering walls and muttered,
“I wish you happiness.”















"
16,v2c11,2,11,"A single motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) was running on a sandy beach.
It was a motorrad loaded with traveling luggage on top and on both sides of its rear wheel. It was headed towards the north, leaving thin tire tracks on the relatively hard sand near the beach.
On the left side was the expanse of the clear blue and calm ocean. On the right was a large desert, with its thousands of rippling sand dunes. It was a world of water and sand.
The motorrad’s driver was wearing a black jacket with a wide belt fastened around the waist. Suspended on her right thigh was a holster for a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol). Placed inside was a high-caliber revolver.
The driver was wearing a brimmed hat with flaps covering the ears, and silver-framed goggles. It was a young person whose age was probably a little over mid-teens.
Suddenly, the driver tapped the tank of the motorrad, and pointed ahead.
At a considerable distance, a white line which looked like the shimmer of hot air can be seen floating on the blue surface. As they came closer, they realized what the line was. It was a bridge.
It was a large bridge.
A number of bridge piers [1] rising from the ocean were systematically lined up. White stones were put together to form arches. The width has just enough allowance for a big car to pass through it. Its height from the water surface was around the height a person can jump.
The bridge rose abruptly from the desert, earnestly continuing straight towards the west, and vanished with the horizon.


The motorrad arrived at the edge of the bridge. The driver got off and looked up.
The driver made a little conversation with the motorrad about the place.
‘For sure, this is the bridge that we’re looking for. If we cross it, we can get to the neighboring continent without having to pay for a ferry,’ the driver said happily.
On the other hand, the motorrad found it odd. Why is it that such a splendid bridge was there in a place where no one lives in? And where did the large quantities of building material of white stone came from?
The traveler who told the driver about this bridge could not find anyone who could tell him the answer to these questions. Even so, it didn’t matter to the driver. She added that the important thing was that the bridge exists. The motorrad agreed.
The motorrad asked whether they will be able to cross by the end of the day. The driver answered frankly that it would not be possible because of the distance. She said that she was planning to camp out on top of the bridge and finish crossing it by the next day.
The driver launched the motorrad and began to run on the bridge.
The bridge’s stone paving was made of small stones put together systematically. Its surface was smoothed out and had a glassy appearance. On top of it, the motorrad continued to run comfortably. On both sides of the road, the neatly crafted stone handrails continued on.
After running for a while, nothing but the ocean can be seen all around. The shining blue surface of the water was perfectly divided by the white bridge. Just ahead, the land on the other side falls and disappears with the horizon.
As the motorrad headed west, the sound of its engine resounded noisily over the ocean.
Soon, the day quietly came to an end. When the setting sun began to shine golden on the bridge and water surface, the driver stopped the motorrad.
Night came, and the ocean became dark and quiet. It was as if everything in the earth was flattened, while the stars shone in the sky. The driver complained of the dazzling starlight.
And on top of the bridge, she spread out the blanket, wrapped herself in it and slept.


The next day.
The driver woke up at dawn. The sky had a weak purple color.
She performed some light exercises, and then trained with and maintained the persuader on her right thigh. She ate her breakfast of portable rations. From the cans tied on top of her bag, she took some water for herself and replenished the tank of the motorrad with fuel.
The sun rose. The cloudless sky and the wave-free ocean were stained blue. The driver slapped awake the motorrad and rode towards the west once more.


It was about noon.
‘Stop,’ the motorrad suddenly spoke in a loud voice.
The driver quickly hit the brakes. They came to a halt at the center of the ocean.
‘I saw something,’ the motorrad said. The driver turned the motorrad, and rode back a little as she was told.
The motorrad told the driver to look at a particular handrail they passed through earlier that day. This handrail had exactly the same shape as the rest. The driver was doubtful, and asked why.
The motorrad said that some characters were carved on it. The driver got off the motorrad and examined the handrail. She took off her gloves and touched the surface with her hand.
The driver confirmed that the characters were there, but it was weathered all over that the writings cannot be read anymore. The motorrad suggested that he would read instead. He would also read what the carved characters were in the previous handrails.
The driver thought for a while. And then, she answered that since they can’t waste much time, he had to read the gist of the writings. If there was nothing interesting, they’ll leave right away.
The motorrad agreed and read the writings on the first handrail.
‘We have to fulfill our duty. We have to build a bridge here. As to why, we will leave it in the handrails. It is for that someone who will cross this bridge someday.’
The driver cut the motorrad’s engine right away. In a moment, the sound vanished in the area.
The driver pushed the motorrad and went to the next handrail. She asked the motorrad to read all of the writings in succession.
The motorrad agreed, and read the fading characters——
‘We lived by the beach on the eastern side of the bridge. Over there were the walls of our country. As to why we started to live in a world of sand, a barren land, we haven’t known for a long time. It didn’t really matter to us, and we lived our lives in pleasure; eating fish, singing, and dancing.’
‘Near the country, there were a number of enormous structures we call pyramids. White stones were neatly piled up to build these structures, but as to who, when, or for what purpose they were built, we can only guess. But more than that, the structures were convenient to us. We take the stones and use them to build houses, build roads and repair the walls.’
‘One day, our comrades discovered something from the bottom of the ocean, and salvaged it. It was something like a big vault. After some difficulty in opening it, we found a lot of documents inside. We felt very disappointed because we thought there was something valuable in it.’
‘But through these documents, we came to know the answer to our questions. Why are we here? What are we supposed to do? What have we been doing until now? What are we supposed to do from now on?’
‘One of the documents was a blueprint for a bridge. From the beach right before us, a beautiful arch bridge with a number of bridge piers made up of stone will be built beyond the horizon, crossing into the neighboring continent. It was a magnificent plan. The huge amount of blueprints was for the sake of this plan.’
‘In another document, two facts were specified clearly. One, enough quantities of the stone material that will be used for building the bridge shall be piled up on the beach. Another, the imprisoned criminals shall be allowed to inhabit an area nearby, and shall be made as workers for the construction of the bridge. When the bridge is completed, the sentence of all the prisoners will be erased, and they will be allowed entry to the original country.’
‘The answers to the four questions above are these: We were entrusted with a mission. We were to build a bridge. This fact was ignored and concealed, and we lived our lives in pleasure; eating fish, singing and dancing. And lastly——’
‘There is only one thing we were asked to do. “Build the bridge as instructed.” All of the citizens held one opinion. The detailed blueprints are there. The necessary materials are also there. There are also a lot of people who have seen the olden days. There was no reason for us not to do it, or not to be able to do it.’
‘If the bridge is completed, the decision of returning to the original country, or staying in this land is left to a person’s own judgment. Hope budded in our hearts, that we will be able to find the place where we belong. Since we already achieved the reason why we are here, we started to build the bridge.’
‘The construction of the bridge progressed slowly but steadily. As indicated in the blueprints, the bridge piers should be able to rise from the water, and stones that can be submerged should be used. Such stone can be found inside the pyramids. The stones will be floated to their designated location, and then holes will be opened to put them together while they are submerged. Then sand will be poured on the finished foundation to make a sturdy bridge pier. We were very happy each time we finished one pier, and we continued to gather the stones and extend the bridge’
‘People who are good at diving built the bridge piers in the sea. Some carried the stones from the beach. Those who have strength put together the stones. Those who are skilled polished the surface beautifully. When we have come this far, some caught fish from the top of the bridge. And others cooked them. We shared the work, shifted roles, and our everyday life continued this way. Each day we completed something, and find it wonderful.’


The motorrad read up to this point, and the driver said, ‘I see,’ with a look of admiration. She stroked the stone paving by her feet, tapped the handrail before her, and looked down at a bridge pier nearby.
The motorrad asked whether to continue reading, or to leave now that the mystery was solved.
The driver wondered as to why the country vanished and as to why the people who built the bridge were nowhere to be found. Was it because they all came back to the original country? She said that she wanted to know these things.
The motorrad agreed to go on reading the next one——


‘When our children, who were born around the same time as the bridge, have started to contribute to the work on the bridge, we noticed something. As indicated in the plans, there should be enough stone material for use in the bridge. But there were only a few left. We soon understand the reason. It was because we used them in building our houses and repairing the walls. We were deeply embarrassed by our foolishness, and started to fear that the bridge will not be completed.’
‘There was only one way to solve our problem. We demolished our houses and started to use those stones instead. We wasted so much time in processing the stones that the progress of the construction slowed down. The people who lost their homes had to live with other people, and that became another problem. However regrettable it may be, it is for the completion of the bridge.’
‘Other than demolishing the houses, we also started to use the walls. Though it appears unnecessary, we carved away the stone just in case. There were no offensive countries nearby, but without the walls, the country became covered with sand. Without the walls, we decided to build the houses on top of the bridge. And while we were living there, the bridge continued to stretch out.’
‘Before we know it, the walls and the houses in the country were all gone, and the land turned back into a desert. We did not care about this, and we continued to slowly, but steadily accomplish our mission. The bridge extended. However, we were worried that someday, there will not be enough stone material to use. We worried about it constantly.’
‘And at last, after all our progress, we saw something other than the horizon. In our field of view, we could see a desert in the opposite shore. Our happiness during that time is impossible to leave in these writings.’
‘We used up all of the stone material for the last part of the construction. Now, we no longer doubt the completion of our plans. There was only enough stone. One by one, we dismantled our houses, and used the stones from them. We slept on top of the bridge. The number of people whose bodies were broken down increased, but we paid no heed.’
‘When all of the stones are gone, we would know whether the bridge would be completed or not.’
‘We completed the bridge, except for some parts. It was around the center of the bridge, where the last house was located. We began to notice when we took some stones from there to put together the bridge. Just in that place, there was no stone paving; the rough stone was exposed in a long cavity. It was a foolish mistake.’
‘The bridge is totally useless because of this long and large cavity. To fill this cavity and complete the bridge as indicated in the plans, we need more stone. There can’t be any more in the desert. And we definitely cannot take some stones from other parts of the bridge.’
‘We tried a number of experiments. We hardened the sand and made them into bricks. It didn’t work. We tried to fill up the cavity with large quantities of sand. The people who stepped on it sank. We thought of going somewhere far to get some stones. It was useless talk.’
‘We ran out of ideas, and did nothing but regret our foolishness. There should have been enough materials from the beginning. There was no one to blame but us, for wasting them in making houses and walls. It was our fault. We could only beat ourselves, while looking at the cavity that can’t be filled up right before our eyes.’
‘It was after a while. The only thing left is to fill in this cavity. Only that and the bridge will be complete. We wanted something hard to use instead of the stone paving. We agonized and thought about it, and eventually, we found a wonderful solution to our dilemma. If you think about it, it’s pretty simple. We had the ingredients we needed right from the start.’
‘Among ourselves, we chose weak old people and women, and we killed them. We scraped the flesh from the corpses. We obtained large quantities of the white and hard bones. Surely this is the final ingredient needed to fill in the cavity. We readied large quantities, and lined them up without allowing gaps.’
‘The hole was filled in slowly. Next, we killed all of the children and obtained their bones. The bones of children are small and weak, and breaks once stepped on, so we made little progress. Even so, the flesh was very helpful in catching fish.’
‘Lastly, we decided to kill men in turn. The bones of men are large and hard. As the cavity became smaller, we became happy from the bottom of our hearts. We collected and lined up the bones from the legs and arms as well as the ribs, and filled in the gaps with smashed skulls. We were making favorable progress.’
‘And so all of the cavity was filled in. No one was left but me, but it’s no problem. I can do the rest on my own. I just have to line up the spines, and to polish the surface like what was done with the stone pavement…. Yes, we can complete the bridge, and that’s the reason why I was left here. In other words——’


The driver asked what’s next after ‘in other words’. The motorrad told her that this was the last of the characters. With a look of admiration in her face, she said that even though the last person’s whereabouts were unknown, he must have been here.
‘What’s that?’ the driver heard, as the motorrad urged her to look at her feet. It was subtly different from the other stone pavings. The driver crouched, and upon examining it well, raised a voice of surprise and admiration.
Over there, human spines were put together. The destroyed spines were lined up as if drawn in a pattern. The color was slightly different from the other parts, and thin bones were inlaid in the gaps. Furthermore, the surface had a glassy finish.
The driver raised her face. The bone portion continued for a while, and then returned to the same stone pavement.
On top of the white line amidst this blue world, the driver thought for a while. She thought about something while looking afar.
Then she turned to the motorrad. She said they’re going to stay here for today.
The motorrad was surprised, and asked for the reason. ‘My three-day rule,’ was the short reply of the driver.
The driver fixed the puzzled motorrad firmly on its center stand. She took down the luggage from the carrier on top of the rear wheel.
‘Right, I can relax and fish for today. I should eat fish from time to time.’ Upon saying this, the driver rummaged inside the boxes on both sides of the rear wheel. She took out a thread and a fish hook.
‘You don’t have a rod,’ said the motorrad.
The driver opened the big bag. A disassembly-type rifle persuader was strapped on the inside of the cover. The driver took it, connected the front and rear portions together and snapped them in place with a pin. [2] She attached the thread with the fish hook and sinker on the tip of the barrel. As well as the bell.’
‘Master’s gonna cry if she sees this,’ said the motorrad.
Though slightly different from an appropriate bait, the driver used the portable rations, let down the thread, and sat in front of the handrails. She took off her hat and gazed leisurely at the sky. And then she slowly made a big stretch.
‘Hey, can you really fish with that?’ the motorrad asked.
‘Who knows,’ the driver answered.


In the blue ocean, there was a completely straight white bridge.
It was a magnificent bridge that crosses the ocean. Over there, one motorrad was parked. Beside was a lone human, fishing with a rifle.
Just a little bit away from there, there was a part where the stone pavement was slightly different from the rest.
The color was subtly different and it was patterned. Looking at it from above, there was something written in big letters.
Over there was the continuation of the writings:
‘We have fulfilled our duty.’















"
17,v3c1,3,1,"We were in a teahouse.
On the side of an unpaved road lined up with wooden poles was a lone house, the eaves of which had been turned into a teahouse.
Master Shizu was sitting by the porch, gazing leisurely at the afternoon scenery.
I was sitting across in front of him, on top of the hardened earth, similarly gazing at my surroundings.
Amidst the mild, sunny weather, the green and brown of the endless expanse of softly undulating fields blended together. It was dotted with a few houses accompanied with silos or barns.
Master Shizu muttered, “It’s such a tranquil land, isn’t it?”
I agreed in silence.


My name is Riku, I am a dog.
I have long, white, bushy fur. My face looked as if it’s happy and smiling all the time, but it doesn’t mean that I am. I was just born this way.
Shizu is my master. He is a young man who is always wearing a green sweater. He has lost his homeland due to some complex circumstances, and is now traveling in a buggy. We travel to various countries together.
Master Shizu’s journey doesn’t have any particular destination. No, it is aiming for somewhere, but this ‘somewhere’ is not a place.


Following the road, we arrived in an isolated country situated in an enormous prairie.
We were permitted through the gate, in which there was no sort of screening whatsoever. The guard was very surprised since visitors seldom come to this country.
“Even if people bothered to come here, there’s nothing to see in this country.”
Just as he told us, the interior of the country had nothing but a dull, infinite expanse of flat plains. There was a bit of forest, but most of the land was composed of meadows and fields. It seemed like all of the residents were farmers.
Master Shizu rode for a while through the unchanging scenery, and eventually we found the teahouse.


“Travelers are really rare, you know. Anyway, please relax,” the old woman who brought us tea said.
She placed the tea, which was served in a cup without a handle, beside Master Shizu. It did not smell of poison.
Master Shizu thanked her. He placed his favorite sword that stood by his side right in front of me. It is my duty to watch over this sword when Master Shizu’s attention is away from it.
While drinking his tea, Master Shizu asked the old woman some questions about this country, such as whether the old woman has any other job. She sat down beside Master Shizu and replied.
Apparently, this country has taken leisure at doing just agricultural work. The population was small and thinly distributed. Only a handful can be called towns.
There were no nearby potential enemy countries. Even if there were, they wouldn’t gain anything from occupying this country.
Almost no travelers come. Even if they did, there were no tourist attractions here for them to see.
They only let each day pass by in peace.
“Mister traveler, where are you headed?”
To this question, Master Shizu only shrugged his shoulders in jest. “There’s no particular place I’m aiming for. I’m a vagabond,” he said truthfully.
“Oh my,” the old woman was a bit surprised. “In case you’re interested, immigrants are always welcome in this country. There is a surplus of land, and people who can help with the work are always appreciated. If you’re able, you can have a job as a guard.” Then she added, “But since nothing happens here, you’ll be free all the time.”
Master Shizu smiled a little. “That might be a good idea.”


The old woman returned to the kitchen.
While looking at the scenery, Master Shizu muttered, “It’s such a tranquil land, isn’t it?”
I agreed in silence.


Far in the fields, a single tractor was moving. From our seats, we could see that it was moving in a very leisurely pace. It was approaching a house; perhaps it was finished with the day’s work.
“It might not be a bad idea to make a living here raising cattle. It’s something I have never done before… I no longer have to work for various people, or kill someone to survive, or wander aimlessly in the wilderness. I will be able to live each day in stability and safety. Perhaps, I could live a little bit longer…,” Master Shizu said slowly, still looking at a distance, and probably, looking at his past and his future.
“I guess so,” was the only thing I said. Whatever it was, the decision is in Master Shizu’s hands.
As Master Shizu tried to say something, the old woman came out and asked him, “Mister traveler, do you want another cup of tea?”
“Yes please,” Master Shizu said, and held out his cup.
The old woman poured tea from a small kettle.
After she finished pouring, Master Shizu placed the cup beside him. Along with the cup’s quiet tapping sound, the ground began to shake.
It’s probably an earthquake. The house and the ground shook slightly. The wooden house creaked and rattled. Waves formed inside the tea cup, spilling it a bit.
And then, the minor vibrations ceased. It only lasted for a few seconds.
“Oh dear,” the old woman quickly took a cloth and wiped the spilled tea. And then,
“?”
I noticed that Master Shizu’s face has hardened into a very surprised expression. He was looking at the scenery before him.
I looked at the same direction… and was similarly surprised.
The house and the tractor that we have seen from afar only a while ago, vanished from sight.
“… The house disappeared?” Master Shizu spoke as he rose from his seat.
The old woman standing by his side looked in the same direction and spoke in a tone unchanged from before.
“Ah, I knew it. It has been a while. It might be too late to save them.”
Master Shizu faced the old woman. “W-what just happened?”
The old woman told them to wait for a while, and started to talk to someone somewhere using the phone in the wall.
The old woman interrupted the call for a moment and spoke to Master Shizu.
“Mister traveler, there is a faster way to understand what you have just seen other than me explaining it to you. Go to the right and then turn left at the first intersection. Please do not get too close.”


Master Shizu rode the buggy, and followed the road as he was told.
Eventually, Master Shizu stopped the buggy atop a swell, and got off. I alighted from the passenger seat and went on top of the hood to look. I instantly understood what happened.
A hole opened up in the ground.
It was almost a perfect circle, with a diameter of about 200 meters. I have no idea how deep it was from where I stood. The ground had vanished vertically just like that. Without a doubt, the house and the tractor from earlier were inside this hole.
“……”
Master Shizu looked in amazement. From behind, we heard a siren, and a crane truck approached. Master Shizu moved the buggy to make way.
Soon the truck moved in the vicinity of the hole, and extended the crane to look at the bottom. At the tip of the crane is a bucket for carrying people, which was suspended and moved down into the hole.
“They are… considerably prepared and skilled for this,” Master Shizu murmured.
Another car stopped beside the buggy.
“Ah, travelers, eh? It’s dangerous so you’d better not go any nearer. You will find a teahouse when you turn back to the right, the old lady over there can tell you all the details,” said the man riding inside.


“A hole opened up, as you’ve seen,” the old woman spoke in a fairly normal tone to Master Shizu when we came back.
“What in the world was that? And why?” Master Shizu asked.
The old woman took it without any hint of surprise, and told us that it’s a common occurrence.
“A long time ago, there was a stone quarry in this area. The whole place is full of cavities. That’s why it’s not surprising for a place to vanish just like that.”
“……. There’s no way to prevent it?”
“We do not have blueprints of the old quarry, and no one is willing to investigate it…” The old woman looked a little troubled as she said this. Then she went on, “Well, it’s not a big deal. The one you’ve seen earlier, of house and people being swallowed, is a rare thing. The empty hole will just have to be filled in. The ground caves in only a few times every month. It’s not something to worry about.”
“……”
As the old woman replaced Master Shizu’s cold tea, she asked, “Oh, right. Mister traveler, what are you going to do from now on? If you want to live in this country, shouldn’t you already be looking for a place where you can build your house?”
Master Shizu shook his head with a somewhat twitchy smile.
And then he asked where he could immediately obtain portable rations and fuel for the buggy. 














"
18,v3c2,3,2,"“Okay! I have a good idea. Take me with you. I wanna travel too,” the child said.
The traveler with the short black hair, and the motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) beside her, upon hearing this, fell to an awkward silence.
It was a pretty looking garden that seemed to be taken with great care. Beautiful red and blue roses blossomed all around, and there was also a marble fountain.
“Great idea, huh? I’ve been thinking about what you said. I’ll be able to look at a lot of other countries. Oh, and I’ll be able to study a lot too, right? So take me with you,” the child said with an ecstatic expression on his face.
The traveler who was telling stories about her travels upon the child’s request, made an awkward expression.
“I apologize, but I won’t be able to fulfill that wish.”
“Uh-huh, no way,” added the motorrad, and the child spoke in a loud voice.
“Why! How come miss traveler is able to travel, but I’m not to?”
He turned to face the old man on his side.
“I can go, right?”
The old man made an awkward expression, but firmly said.
“No, that’s impossible.”
“Why? Are you saying you won’t follow my orders? Is that what you’re trying to say? Huh? Huh?”
The child held onto the man and shouted this as if he was attacking him.
Seeing the man’s embarrassed expression, the traveler got up from her seat, and held on to the motorrad’s handlebars to push it.
“If you’ll excuse me.”
The child held onto the traveler after wobbling towards her.
“Why?! Tell me why!!”
The traveler looked down towards the child and answered,
“Traveling is very dangerous.”
“Yeah, and there’s no room for you to sit down, you know,” the motorrad chimed in.
After she bade the old man farewell, the traveler started to leave, pushing the motorrad with her. The child screamed desperately while pursuing the traveler.
“Take me with you! I’ll do anything you say! I’ll even eat my carrots! I’ll behave! I won’t even say that I can’t sleep without mom! So please, take me!”
After telling the child not to follow her one last time, the traveler left, ignoring the child’s frantic cries.
As the traveler disappeared with the noise of the motorrad’s engine, the child cried and wailed loudly.
It was a pretty looking garden that seemed to be taken with great care. Some beautiful red and blue roses blossomed all around, and there was also a marble fountain.
The child buried his face into the arms of the old man who knelt next to him.
And he cried. He cried and cried.


The old man who aged even more greatly than before waked the child who was now a young man.
The child who was now a young man had fallen asleep in a chair in a luxurious office. After the young man thanked the old man, he told him about the dream he just had.
“Sorry for being a pain in the neck.”
And he told the old man that he still remembered that day clearly, and apologized to the old man in a gentle voice.
The old man quietly smiled and bowed respectfully to his king.















"
19,v3c3,3,3,"There was a country with great, big gates.
Inside its gates, there was a facility built for the sole purpose of resupplying fuel and water. Right there an enormous trailer truck was parked.
A bumper guard was positioned in front of the protruding engine of the trailer head, whose job was to send flying and kill any living creature that happened to pass before it. Behind was the driver’s seat, as well as the makeshift sleeping cabin of several people. The workers were supplying this ‘mobile home’ with fuel, water and food.
Behind the trailer head were four long, box-shaped, pallet cars connected with each other. They were like train freight cars with eight wheels on each side, but without any windows.
At the center of the roof of the first pallet car, there were handrails and a passage for people to walk on. Over there, one woman was standing.
It was a youthful woman with long, black hair. She was comfortably, yet elegantly dressed, with a high-caliber revolver suspended from her right hip. A rifle-type persuader (Note: A gun) is also slung on her back.
On top of the next car, there was a man. It was a young man who was a bit on the short side, but with a handsome face. On his left hip was a slim automatic-type hand persuader, and he was holding a high-caliber rifle with a drum magazine.
“Master,” the man spoke to the woman, prompting her to look below, “It’s the young lady.”
Standing beside the trailer head was a small girl wearing a red dress. She looked up at the woman with a scowl.
The woman walked up to the roof of the trailer head and climbed down its ladder. She approached the girl who continued to glare at her, and crouched down until their eyes are at the same level.
“Hello,” the woman spoke.
“Are you two the bodyguards this time?” the girl asked.
“Yes, that’s right,” the woman said with a smile and a nod.
And then the girl spat out, “We don’t need bodyguards!” 
“How come?” the woman asked gently.
The girl sputtered, looking straight ahead. “You see, a person’s life and destiny is decided by God. If we are supposed to die, that is something God has decided on, you know. And you see, you people are getting in the way——”
“Then is it okay with you if you and everybody here were to die?”
“If it is fated,” the girl said firmly.
“Even so, it is our job to protect your lives,” the woman replied without changing her kind expression.


The trailer ran through the wilderness. Looking around, one could see the glaring sun, the blue sky, and the dry, reddish earth and rocks sparsely covered by grass.
The driver was replaced while the trailer was running. It has been going on since morning without making a single stop. The dusty region continued far across the distance.
At the roof of the pallet cars, the two bodyguards looked around, still holding their persuaders. They were wearing goggles and lifelines hooked to the car handrails.
A little past noon,
“Master! Ten o’clock!” the male bodyguard cried to the woman. The man immediately positioned his rifle.
Twenty cars were approaching the front of the trailer diagonally from the left, raising dust behind them. The ones riding the small, modified buggies were all men, and of course, they all have persuaders.
The trailer sped up. A black smoke rose from its chimney and the trailer dashed forward ready to knock over any car standing on its way.
The attackers surrounded the trailer and started firing intermittently. The bullets bounced off the pallet cars. The male bodyguard placed his rifle on the rolled cushion atop the handrail, and positioned to fire.
An empty cartridge flied out along with the thunderous roar of the rifle. The man fired one shot. Steam sprayed up from one of the vehicles, and eventually stopped. Three cars were brought down in quick succession. The other vehicles distanced away to escape from the accurate snipes of the man.
At that time, the trailer dropped its speed to avoid a hole in the ground. Its huge form wriggled like a snake. One car took this opportunity to approach the trailer. As the sparks from the collision scattered, a man jumped towards the trailer head and grabbed the ladder.
“I’ll do something about it.” The female bodyguard went towards the trailer head, sliding down the hook of her lifeline.
The man climbed the ladder. The window of the trailer head opened and someone leaned out. The man was ready to defend himself when he realized that it was only a little girl.
“Come here!”
He grabbed her roughly by the collar and dragged her with one hand through the window. The girl, with a distressed expression, was forcefully raised up the roof.
From the top of the pallet car, the female bodyguard, while aiming her revolver, spoke to the man who was holding the girl’s side with his right hand and pointing a revolver to her head with his left.
“Please stop.”
“You’re just in time. Woman! Go to the driver’s seat and stop this trailer!” the man shouted. The trailer sped up once again, and the wind’s noise became more intense.
“Hurry! Or else, I’ll blow up this brat’s head!” The man poked the girl’s head with the barrel. As if it was a signal, the expressionless girl’s face changed color. Her eyes widened and she turned pale.
“No—! I don’t want to die! No! No! I don’t want to die! Help me!” the girl screamed. She shook her head wildly, and teardrops fell from her face.
“It can’t be helped,” the woman said calmly.
She returned the revolver in her holster. She removed her lifeline hook and moved to the roof of the trailer head. And then, she passed right beside the two.
“Please save me…” were the only words the girl whose face was soggy with tears managed to say. The woman smiled sweetly.
“Hurry up!” The man changed the aim of his revolver from the girl’s head to the woman.
In the next moment, the woman was holding the revolver’s cylinder. The gun wouldn’t fire even if he pulled the trigger because the hammer wouldn’t raise. At the same time as the man’s expression changed, several holes opened up in his shoulder. Deep red liquid oozed from the holes.
“?”
The man looked at his right shoulder with a dumbstruck expression. The woman took back the girl from the man’s powerless arms with ease. Located two cars behind, the male bodyguard was aiming his square-barreled automatic-type hand persuader. He fired one more time.
The bullet followed its aim to the man’s knee. His body staggered as his leg lost its bending force. And then the man slipped and fell down from the roof of the trailer head. The man’s face registered disbelief in what just happened for nearly two seconds before he was smashed on the ground.
The fallen man’s legs and arms rotated and bent into a strange angle before he disappeared into the dust.
The woman leered at the attackers’ cars as they all escaped, while the girl sobbed bitterly in her arms.


The next morning.
The trailer safely passed through the gates of a big country. It stopped beside a square near the gates.
Soon, one worker began to unload the luggage. The doors of the pallet cars opened, and a chain was pulled out by a small car. What came out were humans who were tied together with their necks and arms, like a string of beads.
All were covered with vomit and feces. Another worker sprayed water on their heads using a hose. The chains were skillfully removed from the ones who can no longer walk, and they were dragged towards the edge of an enormous hole on the side. The back of their heads were shot with a persuader, and they were rolled and dropped into the hole.
The two travelers received their luggage as they spoke to the married couple who owned the trailer, along with their only daughter.
The owner thanked the two, smiling from ear-to-ear and shaking their hands.
The small girl wearing a red dress shyly pressed against her mother’s back.
The girl spoke to the female bodyguard who crouched before her. “… Thank you for saving me,” she said with a small, but clear voice.
The female bodyguard replied with the same gentle expression as before. “You’re welcome. However, it’s not because of me. I’m sure your God thought that it was yet too early for you to die.”
The girl threw her arms around the female bodyguard. The woman put her arms around her small back, and gently patted it. A gunshot was heard.[1]


The female bodyguard asked the owner if they wanted to be escorted home. The owner said that there will be no problem as they will be taking a detour unknown to the attackers after emptying their cargo. Then he asked the two if they wanted to hitch a ride.
The woman asked about the route, but turned down his offer, with the excuse that they have to return right away.


“I understand the route. I thank you in advance.” 
A man was speaking to the two ex-bodyguards.
This man, along with all the others who were glaring at the two, was part of the group that attacked the trailer. The man who stepped up was their leader, and this place hidden in the mountains was their hideout.
“Then, we will be taking the payment,” the woman said. 
“Wait,” said the leader. “You killed one of our comrades. Why?” he asked, glaring at the woman.
“Because the job I accepted was to find out the homeward route of that trailer. It was necessary. Besides, things didn’t work out as planned,” the woman said matter-of-factly. They could almost hear the sound of molar-grinding from the men around them.
The leader spoke. “He was a brave man, loved by everybody. My younger brother, the only family I have left after they were killed by those bastards.”
“Is that so?” The woman said without hesitation, and the men around them raised the weapons in their hands. While all of them glared at the woman, the male bodyguard beside her removed his jacket.
“Phew, it’s so hot in here,” the man said, revealing his body covered with a number of square, clay-like, plastic explosives. The place became quiet all of a sudden.
“That’s enough…. Take this with you. We were supposed to anyway.”
After examining the payment handed to her, the woman turned away.


The man and the woman were riding on a small, battered car through the wilderness. The barrel of the rifle, which couldn’t fit inside the car, was protruding through the window.
The woman was driving while the man was eating the unsavory clay-like portable rations wrapped around his body earlier. He offered them to the woman, who shook her head in reply.
“Master,” said the man.
“What is it?”
The man hesitated for a few seconds before asking, “That trailer will be attacked again, won’t it?”
“That is very likely,” the woman answered in an extremely natural manner.
“Is that all right?” The man asked.
The woman did not answer.















"
20,v3c4,3,4,"A single motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) was running through a world of white.
It was a flat, dazzling, endless space of pure white.
In this place, the earth was made of salt.
The dried and hardened surface of salt was like a field of snow. East, west, south and north; there was only the white horizon visible in all directions.
The sun was at its zenith, the pale blue sky was cloudless, and the plains shone white below it.
The motorrad was running towards the west on top of the salt field, encountering not a single obstacle. A box was attached on both sides of its rear wheel. A bag, a sleeping bag, cans of fuel and water, and other traveling luggage were loaded on top of its rear carrier.
The rider was wearing a brown coat, the excess hem of which was rolled up to the thighs. She was wearing a hat with flaps covering her ears and yellow single-lens goggles. Her face was covered with a bandana to protect herself from sunburn.
A rifle-type persuader (Note: A gun) was hanging in front of her body with a leather strap. It was a slim rifle with a wooden stock, equipped with a sniper’s scope. 
“Kino, behind at seven o’clock,” the motorrad spoke suddenly in a loud voice, so as not to lose to the sound of the engine.
The rider called Kino slackened the accelerator a little and turned her head behind to the left.
“I can’t see it. How far ahead are we?”
“A good deal. Besides, they’re using ordinary horses. They seem to be desperately trying to chase us, but it’s impossible for them to catch up,” said the motorrad.
“If that’s the case, then let’s escape like this.”
“Roger.”
Kino maxed the accelerator. The motorrad accelerated and ran through the salt fields in an unparalleled speed.
“They came just as we thought, Hermes,” said the rider.
“Yeah, they sure did. The info you got was perfect,” the motorrad called Hermes replied.


Kino and Hermes rode until sunset.
Because nothing could be seen from afar after dark, they camped out on the empty, white fields.
Kino dug a hole in the hard salt, then, keeping Hermes away, she made a fire at the bottom of it using solid fuel.
With her persuader beside her bed, Kino slept under the sky full of stars.


The next day.
Just as the previous day, Kino and Hermes rode towards the western horizon.
The scenery hasn’t changed a bit. The sky was clear and the wind was not blowing. Kino cut the engine to take a break.
And her ears ached from the silence.
Just about noon.
Again, Hermes spoke suddenly while running. “Kino, they’ve come again. Eight o’clock. This time it’s a car.”
Kino turned her head. There was a small dot from afar. It slowly became bigger in view.
“Will they catch up with us?” Kino asked.
“Looks like it. They are faster than us,” Hermes said calmly. Kino looked again.
“What now?” Hermes asked. Kino released her grasp from the handle of the accelerator, and released the safety of her persuader.
“I knew it.”
“It can’t be helped. As to why they would attack a traveler out of the blue, I have no idea. I’d love to know.”
Kino returned her hand to the handle, turned around, and looked at their pursuers.
A white smoke thinly drifted from the car that has gotten much bigger in view.
“Kino, they’re firing!”
“I know. But it’s still far. If they hit me from this distance…”
“If they did?” Hermes asked. Kino smiled a little as she spoke.
“Then today must be a fairly lucky one.”
“This is not a joke. You should return fire immediately,” Hermes complained in a loud voice.
“Not yet, only a bit more,” was Kino’s only reply.
The distance between them gradually shrank, and smoke rose intermittently from the car. While running, Kino glanced behind to look at the pursuers. Then all of a sudden,
“Okay. Here’s good.”
She slackened the accelerator and turned sharply to the left. They were exposed to the pursuing car straight from the left.
“Kino, you made it easier for them to shoot you, what in the world are you thinking?” Hermes asked.
Kino did not answer, and instead fixed the accelerator, and removed her hands from the handles. She immediately positioned her persuader, aimed and fired in an instant.
The car’s front right tire burst and scattered from the force of its rotation.
Kino immediately returned her hand to the handles and made a big turn to the right.
The car pitched forward, its front right wheel and body scraping the salt ground at length. The driver tried to stop the car, but it overturned to the right, shaking off its passengers ostentatiously.
“It stopped,” said Hermes.
“Well, let’s run away,” Kino accelerated.


The next day.
Once again, Kino and Hermes were running on the salt fields.
To the north and south, the tops of mountains were faintly visible like an island emerging from the sea’s horizon. As usual, there was nothing to behold from the west where Kino and Hermes were headed.


“There’s something right ahead.”
Around noon, Hermes spoke as he ran.
Kino loosened the accelerator a bit and asked, “What is it?”
“I wonder? Trees standing side by side, maybe. It doesn’t look like there are any humans around,” Hermes said in a slightly worried tone.
A little doubtful, Kino stood up while riding. Eventually, something that looked like a black line became dimly visible from a distance. She approached warily and realized that it was a row of stakes pierced on the ground.
Kino stopped Hermes in front of the stakes.
Each of the wooden stakes was about the height of a child, and the distance between the stakes wouldn’t let a car pass in between. It has drawn an endless line on the white ground. The line extended from the southeast to the west.
“What could this be?” Hermes asked.
Kino tilted her head. “Who knows? I have no idea at all. Someone’s guideposts perhaps…. But if it were, there’s no need for them to be stuck too close to each other.”
“You weren’t told anything about this?”
“Nope. I heard that there’s someone who’ll come and attack us, that’s all.”
“Hmm.”
“Well, no matter. Since it’s going west, let’s just run along it.” 
Kino launched Hermes. 
“Don’t get lost, okay?” Hermes reminded.


While they were running, they saw a man pounding at the stakes.
Hermes soon informed Kino, and she released the safety of her persuader.
A small car was parked just ahead the path Kino was taking, and several stakes were piled up on its carrier. There was an elderly man wearing sunglasses, his face tanned black due to sunburn. The man was hammering down the tops of the stakes. He was hammering with intense concentration.
The man noticed the sound of the engine and turned around. The motorrad came out from the shadow of the car, slid its rear wheel in front of the man and stopped.
“Hello,”
“Hi,”
Kino and Hermes greeted the surprised man.
The man raised the hammer. Then he saw Kino holding a persuader with both hands, and dropped the hammer while gnashing his teeth. The man shouted.
“You wretch! Even if you kill me with that persuader, what’s mine will still be mine! You won’t be able to steal it from me!”
After she was sure that the man was finished shouting, Kino lowered her bandana and spoke. “I don’t have any idea what you are talking about. What is it that you think we were going to take away from you?”
Once again, the man yelled, “What, you’re trying to play innocent now?”
In a polite tone, Kino told the man that she has no intention of hurting him or stealing anything from him, and that he should calm down.


“Then, you mean to say that you two were merely travelers using this salt lake instead of a road?”
The man has somewhat settled down, and asked Kino who stood beside Hermes.
“Yes. We have no intention of staying here or taking away anything from here.” Kino slung the persuader on her back and opened the front of her coat.
The man replied in an indifferent tone. “Well, whatever. If that’s what you say. However, don’t you think I deserve an apology from you for trespassing into my private property?”
“Private property?” Hermes asked.
“That’s right. South of this line,” the man pointed at the row of stakes. Kino and Hermes were standing south of the line.
“… Uh, did you just say ‘private’?” Kino asked.
“You didn’t know?” the man said with a shocked face.
“This is what I meant by ‘mine’.”
“What?” Hermes asked. The man shook his head.
“If the rider is stupid, so is the motorrad. Isn’t it obvious? This land.”
“But, it’s just salt, isn’t it?” Hermes immediately replied.
“This salt can be dug up and sold you know! Didn’t you learn that from your travels?”
Kino spoke to the man in an extremely polite tone.[1]
“We did not know. If it’s fine with you, kindly excuse our insufficient knowledge and enlighten us.”
“Hmph!” the man snorted, and continued, “It can’t be helped. Because of that honest attitude, I’ll tell the whole story especially for you. You see, I was originally a traveler. To be precise, ‘we’ were travelers.  A dozen of us were traveling as a group.”
“You were a traveler?” Hermes asked.
“Yes, that’s right. We left out of disgust of our homeland. We traveled with a number of vehicles and horses.”
“And then?”
“And then, without a place to go, without a country to accept us, our days of wandering continued. We were already exhausted. There were disputes, and we lost our money. We even thought of becoming thieves. But at that time, the goddess of fortune gave us an incredible gift.”
“What is it?” Hermes asked.
“You still don’t get it after I said this much? This salt! We struggled and stumbled upon this land,” the man said in astonishment.
“And after that?”
“After that, we quarried the salt from here, and began to sell them in countries to the north and south. It saved us. Anyhow, we received profit simply by transporting and selling something which was originally free. We obtained fuel and food in the countries, and then make a round trip back here. There was no need for us to immigrate. We can earn a living without having to stay in a country. We continued this way of life ever since.”
“I see, I understand up to that part. But what happened to the others?” Hermes asked.
“Those guys? I broke away from them,” the man grunted.
“Why?”
“Hmph. That’s because I’ve had enough of their greed.”
“Greed?”
“Yeah. For a short time, we worked together. But after that, those rogues divided into groups and began plotting to take the salt all for themselves. In short, they pretended to work hard for us. There was dispute after dispute, and in the end we chose to live apart. We each chose our own territory, and sell to whichever country we like. Hmph. If I stayed with them any longer, I would have become greedy like them. It was right to part with them.”
“Then that means your former traveling companions have taken ownership of the salt all over this salt lake, and tries to eliminate all that comes near?” Kino asked. 
“The mystery of the attack on travelers solved,” Hermes murmured in an inaudible voice.
“Ah, you’ve met them?” the man asked.
“Yes. They fired at me without warning.”
“Tsk. It’s not surprising for those no-brains to do such a thing. It’s likely they thought that you were my underling or something. They are idiots to the core. Come to think of it, they were like that since birth,” the man said.
“Since birth? How did you know?” Kino asked.
“Ah, those idiots were my sons. Five of them, plus their wives and children. It was my family who went in a journey.”  
“……”
“……”
Kino and Hermes fell silent.
“They were really greedy, those bastards. Such rotten character. Unlike me, they did not clearly specified the borders of their territory, did nothing but to haphazardly quarry the salt, and gave no mercy to anyone who comes near. Goodness, I’m glad I did not become like them,” he spat.


“That was very helpful. Thank you very much. By the way, I would like to have your permission,” said Kino.
“For what?” The man asked.
“We freely entered your territory without your knowledge. I’m terribly sorry. So, please forgive our rudeness, but we would like to ask for your special permission to allow us to head west from your land starting here. We hope for your kind consideration.”
“… Hmph. If you’ve said that at the very beginning, then I wouldn’t have shouted at you. Okay then. I give you my special permission,” the man said arrogantly.
“Thank you very much. Well then, we’ll be excusing ourselves.”
“Bye-bye. Good luck with your work.”
“Hmph. You don’t have to tell me.”
Kino wore her bandana and went astride Hermes. She started the engine and soon rode away.


As the motorrad drove away, the man began to hammer the stakes.















"
21,v3c5,3,5,"Inside a forest, there was a single road.
It was a dark forest, dense with tall conifers. The earth was damp and overgrown with ferns.
A path ran perfectly straight from east to west, as if cutting through the forest. It was a wide road. The remains of the stone paving laid out a long time ago stretched on, its gray surface full of cracks.
A single, tiny tree sprout grew out from the gap opened by the cracks.
It was a seed that was transported some way or the other, fell on top of the soil in the crack by chance, and grew.
The tiny bud that sprouted from the seed was illuminated by the bright sunlight that was streaming in, unhindered, in the middle of the road.
On this road ran a lone motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly).
The motorrad’s front and rear wheels trampled on the tiny sprout.
It passed there in an instant, without leaving any trace.
The motorrad ran westward on the cracked road.
Boxes were attached on both sides of its rear wheel, on top of which was a bag as well as a sleeping bag. A silver cup dangled from the bag, shaking from the minute vibrations of the vehicle.
Its rider was a young person, around mid-teens.
She was wearing a black jacket fastened with a wide belt on the waist. On her right thigh was a holster for a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) containing a revolver. There was also an automatic-type behind her waist.
On top of her short black hair was a hat. It resembled a pilot’s hat, with a brim at front and ear flaps on both sides. Strapped on it was a pair of silver-framed goggles that was peeled in places.
Eventually, the rider tapped the motorrad’s tank.
“I see it,” the rider said.


Inside the forest, there was a green wall.
It was the tall wall surrounding a country. It drew an elegant curve with a smooth upward arc protruding to the outside. Its sides were lined up with pillars placed on equal intervals, and was completely covered with a dense growth of dark green ivy.
The motorrad stopped from a place where the entirety of the wall could be seen.
“It’s the first time I’ve seen walls like this,” the rider said, still straddled on the motorrad.
“Yeah, it’s amazing. Its structure is also unusual,” the motorrad agreed.
After this, the rider silently stared at the wall for a while.
“What’s the matter, Kino?” the motorrad asked.
A light smile lingered underneath the goggles of the rider who was called Kino.
“That I would be able to see such things, that I would come this far… A long time ago… I wouldn’t even dream of it as a child. But saying that after all this time feels a bit…”
“Hmm. Well, no one knows what the future holds. As they say, ‘the lesson ahead is on underworld’.”
“… ‘The road ahead is an unknown world’[2]?”
“Yeah, that’s it.”
With this, the motorrad fell silent.
“I wonder if it’s the right thing… or not…,” Kino muttered. “Well, let’s get going, Hermes.”
The motorrad called Hermes answered, “Okay.”
Kino hit the gears, and they slowly rode towards the gates.


“The world… is going to end?”
“The world is going to end. At the dawn of the day after tomorrow.” The female immigration examiner answered Kino’s question, and continued, “But if you still want to, we’ll grant you a three-day stay. That is, if you wish to face the end of the world in our country…”
Kino looked at the female examiner’s serious expression.
The calm and collected female examiner in her late twenties sat alone inside the room at the middle of the thick walls.
“You say the world is going to end, but how is that going to happen?”
“We don’t know that.”
“Huh?”
“But everything in this world is going to end, including our lives of course. It can’t be helped. It’s definite. Absolute. Inevitable,” the examiner answered gently.
“Um… How did you know?” Kino asked.
“That’s a very good question,” the female examiner nodded, and answered with confidence,
“Because of the prophecy.”


Immediately upon passing through the gates, the town illuminated by the evening sun could be seen with one sweep of the eye.
The blurry haze of the wall at the other end could be seen; a gigantic circular wall inclined towards the gentle slope to the center of the country. Wide roads stretched out radially, with alternating farmlands and residential areas in between. There was much greenery left, orderly lined up with houses made of logs with brick chimneys that stand out. Several big buildings and a lake shining golden from the light could be seen at the center.
“The interior is also nice.”
Hermes agreed to Kino’s remark, and said, “Yeah, those log houses are quite pretty. The arrangement, which made use of the terrain, was also well done. ——However, this will all end on the day after tomorrow. Because of the prophecy.”
“Prophecy, eh…,” Kino muttered.
The female examiner didn’t give any explanation as to what the prophecy was, and who told them about it. With a philosophical air, she repeated and reassured them that the world will be destroyed. There’s nothing that could be done about it, as it was based on a completely accurate prophecy.
And then she started to cry all of a sudden. After that, it was futile to try and ask her about anything, so Kino gave up and passed through the open gates.
“What are we going to do, Kino?”
“For the meantime, maybe we should look for a place to stay. Let’s ask someone,” Kino said as she went astride Hermes. Without starting the engine, she lightly kicked off the ground and descended the slope. Like this, she directed Hermes towards a nearby street.
It was a wide street lined up with shops on both sides. However, none of these shops was open, and there was no hustle and bustle of people. There was not a single vehicle running on the street.
“It reminds me of a country in mourning,” Hermes said.
They noticed an old man seated on top of a wooden box, gaze fixed at the dim sky. They asked where they could find a hotel. The old man said nothing and only pointed at a relatively large building a bit ways off.
When they reached the hotel, they knocked at the closed entrance. After some time, the middle-aged owner came out with surprise painted on his face.
After hearing out Kino, the man spoke, “Oh, so you’re a traveler who came just now…. It’s true that my house is a hotel…” Then he asked until when they planned to stay in the country. When Kino answered his question, “The day after tomorrow…? Ah, so your journey will end in this country, huh? That’s too bad.”
The owner told them the same thing as the immigration examiner.
Kino told him that it didn’t matter, so the owner guided them to an elegant and spacious room. He opened the closed sliding door and wiped off the dust on top of a desk. When Kino asked for the cost of the room,
“There’s no need for that. The world is about to end, so money is useless. Please enjoy your stay,” the owner said and left.
Kino unloaded the luggage from Hermes. Then she took off her own jacket and sprawled herself across the bed.
“The world is going to end the day after tomorrow, they say… What could that ‘prophecy’ be all about?”
By the time Hermes asked, Kino was already fast asleep.


The next morning.
Kino woke up at dawn.
She lightly moved her body and performed the maintenance on the revolver she called ‘Canon’ and the automatic she called ‘Woodsman’. She then took a shower after practicing her quick draw several times.
Kino ate her breakfast of portable rations while looking at the sun rising from the walls.
Then she slapped Hermes awake and went out sightseeing. She slowly rode through the town.
At the main street, the dispirited people sat dazedly in chairs in front of the shops. They looked at Kino and Hermes, then averted their gazes disinterestedly.
“What’s the matter with them?” Hermes muttered.
“Everybody’s so lifeless… except for a few.”
Kino suddenly stopped Hermes at the middle of the road. She quickly kicked down his side stand.
“Hmm? Why is th—— Whoa!” Hermes exclaimed as he noticed.
From the side of the road, a young man holding a metal pipe ran towards Hermes. His eyes were bloodshot. The people around looked on in surprise.
Kino stood before the man who brandished his weapon overhead. The man aimed for Kino and swung down the metal pipe.
Kino twisted her body and sent out a low kick. It connected with the man’s legs. The man fell forward, his body hitting the road.
Kino stepped on the collapsed man’s hands and took away the metal pipe. Then she pushed on the man’s back strongly.
The man faced to the side and shouted at Kino.
“Damn it! I’ll kill you! Damn it!”
“What’s his problem——” Hermes muttered.
“Damn… damn…”
The man was sobbing. A middle-aged man among the onlookers spoke to Kino.
“Miss traveler, I’m very sorry. We’ll deal with him and won’t let him do any more foolish things, so can you set free that young man?”
“……”
Kino looked at the apologetic faces of the people around her. Then, she moved away the metal pipe from the young man’s back. As directed by the middle-aged man, the young man, who was still crying, was carried off.
“I’m very sorry. Recently, there were many young ones who started to act violently out of despair…. Your skills really came in handy. We are truly sorry,” the middle-aged man apologized.
“Could it be because of the end of the world?” Kino asked.
The man nodded. “That’s correct. The young ones felt strongly that they have not yet done everything in their lives. They couldn’t accept it…. But it couldn’t be helped. I too have resigned myself to this fate, yet I’m still scared.”
“Hey, what’s that prophecy about, anyway?” Hermes asked. The man slightly taken aback,
“What, so you didn’t know?”
“Yes. If you can, please tell us about it,” Kino said, and the man guided them to a nearby shop.


The shop in the dining hall was lined up with tables and chairs made out of logs. The people who had nothing to do and had gathered there looked at Kino and Hermes. As the lights were not turned on, it was dim, and only the quiet rotation of the ceiling fan was noticeable. At the counter, bottles of liquor were placed for everyone to drink whenever they wish.
The man introduced Kino and Hermes. Kino sat in a chair and Hermes was propped beside her on his center stand.
“It seems that miss traveler here doesn’t know the full story behind the prophecy,” the man said. The people around murmured in surprise. They began to speak as though they were having fun.
“If that’s the case, then an accurate explanation is in order.” “Without knowing the reason, you can’t come into terms with the fact that the world is going to end.” “I agree. This person even took the pains to face the end of the world in our country.” “We should also explain to her about our country’s excellent scholar.” “Let me in, too.”
They assembled around, carrying their seats.
“If I may be so bold, I’ll tell you the story,” the man who served as their guide spoke as he faced Kino. Then he told the people around him to point out any mistakes.
“First, let me tell you about our great book of prophecies, and the person who deciphered it — the scholar our country is very proud of,” the man said, and the people around nodded.
“Book of prophecies?”
“What kind of book?”
Kino and Hermes asked.
“It’s a pity, but it is unknown as to who and when it was written. All we know is that it’s a book containing very strange words, and that it was published a long time ago in some country. Its incoherent writing style would make one think that it was a diary made by someone insane. But the truth is… it’s a book of prophecies that accurately predicts the dreadful fate of this world. And the person who saw through it, and was successful in deciphering it, is our country’s great scholar, the priest of the southern district,” the man answered.
“How did you know that it contained prophecies?” Kino asked.
“Forty years ago, the priest investigated that book out of a half-hearted interest, and discovered a dreadful thing. The number of pages and lines correspond to the year and month of a certain incident, which was then described by the text using metaphors and characters rearranged into code. To his dismay, the priest deciphered other pages… and then…,” the man took a big breath.
“And he discovered many, many, many, many, many more similar prophecies…,” the man said seriously as if he had just discovered it himself. The people around him gasped.
Kino looked around, then asked, “What makes it so definite?”
Not only the man, but the people around answered one after another.
“One hundred and ninety-eight years ago, this country was struck by a severe famine. It was written there…”
“It was precisely stated there how our king 122 years ago would suddenly die from a mysterious illness. Even the fact that it was a disease that makes the nose fall off!”
“There was also that enormous chestnut harvest that troubled us 87 years ago! That was also foreseen by the book! How frightening…”
“There’s also that prediction about the queen mother fracturing her foot from falling off a horse 143 years ago.”
“It also accurately described that it will rain on the day of the bloodless revolution that would throw away the monarchy, 54 years ago; as well as the fact that the king would spend the rest of his life as a gardener!”
“Also, about the great flood brought about by heavy rains on the autumn 44 years ago. The water in the lake could not be used for half a year. The number of characters even revealed the water level!”
“That fire in the northern district 25 years ago. Not only did it predict that it will happen, the number of houses burned down was also written. And about the 89-year old grandma living there, too! When I heard about that, it sent shivers down my spine!”
“That on the winter 23 years ago, twelve wanderers would drift by our country, was also magnificently predicted. And it also foretold that the name of the sole immigrant among those vulgar people who would obtain permanent residency would start with ‘te’… It made big news that time.”
“Nineteen years ago, a chemist wearing a blue shirt killed many people by mixing up poison. That was also prophesied, down to the color of the person’s shirt…”
“The hail that fell early in the summer ten years ago that sent a huge blow to farming families; I remember it so well…”
“That’s not all! Even the syrup we make from the sap of the trees——”
For a while, each person would speak, continuing as long as he wished.
“Um… Did the prophecies occur after the priest discovered that they are going to happen?” Kino asked.
The man shook his head matter-of-factly. “No. After they have occurred, the priest would soon discover that it was prophesied.”
“Huh? Then that means he could interpret it as much as he——”
Hermes’ speech was interrupted by Kino’s kick to his engine.
“I see. I understand up to this point. And what about tomorrow’s prophecy?”
The man’s and everybody’s faces clouded once more upon hearing Kino’s question.
“The prophecy for tomorrow… was written as the last sentence of that book. According to the priest, it was written this way: ‘After the night the nineteenth full moon passes through the sky, the world will end at the rising of the sun. There is nothing we could do except to smash the green plate.’ The green plate here refers to our custom of giving a green plate as a birthday present. This means, ‘There will be no more births. There is nothing we could do but mourn.’”
“Then, in that book’s ‘afterword——”
Hermes’ speech was interrupted by Kino’s kick to his frame.
The man spoke. “It was around thirty years ago when this prophecy became evident. It seems the priest hesitated to announce it, but in the end, he decided that he could not deceive us and made it known to the public…”
“It must have been quite a surprise.”
“Ah, everyone spent a month in lamentation. However, there’s no doubt about the accuracy of the prophecy, so we could only resign ourselves to our fate. The priest’s words were ‘to live life to the fullest until that day comes’. But among us, there were some who despised ‘the future’ as a result…,” the man said.
A middle-aged woman drinking behind him spoke. “And that’s already tomorrow…. Time flows so quickly. Soon, the only thing left for us to do is to gather and drown ourselves in alcohol.”
“Don’t say that…,” another person said gloomily.
“Even if we were told ‘to live life to the fullest until that day comes’, it’s not really a simple thing to look for something to live for…. It’s really sad.”
“I see…,” Kino nodded meekly.
“What are you going to do, miss traveler? There’s only a day left though,” the man asked.
“I guess I’ll do some shopping,” Kino answered.


“The world is going to end tomorrow, so what are you planning to do with the stuff you got?”
The shopkeeper who came out from the interior of the variety store where Kino was shopping asked.
“Well, just in case the prophecy doesn’t come true, I suppose,” Hermes said. The shopkeeper nodded with a look of comprehension.
“Yeah, I understand what you mean…”
“Really?”
“You still couldn’t believe that the world is going to end. That’s understandable. I was the same a long time ago. But with that much proof, saying ‘I don’t believe’ or ‘It’s unbelievable’ are no longer possible. I have given up, and I have no choice but to spend the remaining time efficiently.”
“I see. Well, I’ll continue shopping then. I don’t have the chance to do this often, you know.”
“Well, that’s also good. I’ll give you a ten percent discount on all items here. Take as much as you want. No, it’s better if you take away everything. I’ll feel more relieved that way.”
“Nope. I’m fine with what I could carry. That knife over there looks nice. Can you show it to me?”


“Miss traveler, won’t you join us in prayer? … It may calm you down a bit.”
Kino was invited by a resident as she was taking her dinner in the cafeteria.
Kino politely refused, and went back to the hotel. The owner was praying with his family.


The next morning. That is, the third day since Kino entered the country.
Kino woke up at the crack of dawn.
A thin mist wrapped the whole country. However, for some reason, the calm of the morning was missing. Lights shining from the houses, as well as people running through the streets could be seen.
As Kino was about to start her persuader training, Hermes woke up on his own, giving her a surprise.
“Kino, the world is going to end soon. I woke up because I’m looking forward to it.”
Kino answered while wiping Canon with a cloth, “Is that so…? Surprises sure abound just around the corner.”
“Shall we go sightseeing for the last time?” Hermes asked.
“Sure. It’s the end after all,” Kino answered as she returned Canon to its holster. Then with her left hand, she started to practice her quick draw with Woodsman. Hermes remarked,
“The world is going to end soon, so why bother practice?”


After working up a sweat, Kino rode Hermes through the town.
The fog has lifted. Amidst the cool air, the sky was bright, blue, and clear.
On the ridge of the lake at center of the country, there was a plaza. Over there, a lot of people have gathered, facing the east, and praying anxiously. They were praying as one.
“It’s about time for the sun to rise,” Hermes said. Some elderly residents nearby trembled.
Along with the amplifying voices in prayer, the tolling of a large bell began to echo. It pealed madly again and again. The rays of the sun began to reach the spire of a tall building.
Soon, the dazzling sun emerged from the walls.
The people shrieked in anguish, and went in an uproar.
Kino spoke. “It’s a nice morning.”
“Yup. Let’s ride today as usual,” Hermes agreed happily.


When the sun has completely shown itself, and after about three more minutes, the prayers and lamentation of the residents stopped and turned into unrest, which turned into jeering.
“Nothing happened?” “Has the world ended already?” “Everybody’s still alive!” “The sun has completely risen, too…” “What’s happening——” “How could this be?” “Nothing?” “Damn! Could it be…” “Is it possible…” “——The prophecy… has not come to pass?”
“It’s the priest!” someone shouted.
A black car stopped, and a man wearing stiff clothing headed to the center of the plaza while being surrounded by attendants. It was a middle-aged man with a virtuous expression.
The residents followed him silently with their eyes. Kino and Hermes observed the crowd from behind.
“U-uh, t-to everyone gathered here…”
The tense voice of the priest, whose face looked as if he was having cramps somewhere, came out from a megaphone. The residents who became quiet for a moment simultaneously gave him piercing glances.
“T-the weather today is great, isn’t it——”
“Enough of that! Sir! What has become of the prophecy?!” someone interrupted with a shout.
“A-about that——”
“C-could it be that all of it was a lie?!” another person said.
“N-no. I would never make up a lie…. It was true that those were the last words in the book…”
“Then what’s the meaning of this?! Everyone believed what you said, and thought that the world would end today——” screamed a young woman, who broke down crying right where she stood.
“T-that’s… you know…,” the befuddled priest mixed up his words, as he fumbled for an explanation. Then all of a sudden, “Ah, yes! That’s right! That’s true, everyone! The world has ended! The world has already ended!” the priest bellowed to the top of his voice in the megaphone.
Kino looked at the priest, and at the people, whose eyes were wide in surprise.
The priest, who was speaking to the megaphone held in front of him by his attendant, spread his arms without hesitation, his clothing trailing in the morning wind.
“Everyone, please listen!” He began his passionate speech directed to everyone. “I, as well as everybody here, believed that the world is going to end! That the world will end at the rising of the sun, as was written! Yes! Yes! That’s true! And it was correct! Because! Because! The world we believed to be so! That is, ‘the world that we thought would end because of the prophecy’ has ended indeed! Inside everyone’s hearts, a world has ended! And once again, a new world has begun! Yes! ——The prophecy was right!”
Several seconds of silence passed.
And then, a storm of jeering followed, like a tempest devastating a lake.


Kino and Hermes observed the mayhem for a while.
The angry citizens tried to attack the priest, but the attendants as well as the ardent believers stopped them desperately, and in one way or the other, prevented bloodshed.
Even the people who were throwing all sorts of terrible insults towards the priest had relieved expressions on their faces. There were people crying and embracing each other.
The shopkeeper Kino met the day before found her and talked to her.
“Isn’t it great? The world has not yet ended,” Kino said. The shopkeeper laughed awkwardly,
“By the way, about the stuff I sold you yesterday…”
“Yes. I’ll use them with great care. They make great souvenirs from this country,” Kino replied with a smile, and the shopkeeper left with a dry smile on his face.
The priest, whose shoulders were already limp, tried to escape the plaza stealthily with his attendants. As they tried to board the car, the priest suddenly lifted his face.
It was a face distorted in fear.
The priest suddenly moved. He snatched away the megaphone held by a person nearby.
“E-everyone! Please listen!” He shouted with all his might. Everyone looked at the source of the voice, and their faces contorted in disgust.
“E-e-e-e-everyone! I-it’s not today! I noticed it just now! I realized it just now! It’s very important! Please listen! Please listen to me!”
As an attendant tried to stop him, the priest continued to yell out.
“T-the world is going to end! I made a mistake! ‘After the night the nineteenth full moon passes through the sky’! I just realized it last night! It was wrong! It was a mistake! Everyone, don’t you remember?! Four full moons ago, wasn’t there a lunar eclipse?! Didn’t the moon disappear?! It was wrong! We should only count the nights when ‘a full moon crosses the sky’! Ugh! *Cough*!”
The priest choked. He continued desperately, “That’s why! Indeed the world has not ended today! The truth is it will end on the sunrise after the next full moon! At that time, our world will really come to an end! Everyone! You should acknowledge this!” the priest declared boldly. A nearby man quickly snatched away the megaphone,
“Is that so?!” he said to the priest. And continued, “Everyone! We no longer have to believe in these prophecies! No one knows the future! That is the truth!”
There was applause.
The dumbfounded priest was dragged by his attendants, and vanished inside the car. The car drove away and disappeared.
“Well, it’s about time for us to leave,” said Kino.


Kino and Hermes departed from the western gate.
She looked one last time at the strange walls, then rode through the path.
Kino and Hermes climbed the gently-sloping mountain. When she looked back once, the country already looked small.
“Three people,” Hermes suddenly spoke while running. Kino nodded silently.
Kino stopped Hermes right in the middle of the road. Without turning off his engine, she propped him on his center stand. There was forest on both sides.
“Who might you be? There’s no need to conceal yourselves,” Kino spoke loudly without removing her hat or goggles.
The presence of people moving inside the forest was felt, and then.
“Well, that was rude of us!”
A voice replied. Two men came out, pushing through ferns. The men who looked around thirty were dressed in clothes like that of a traveler or a woodcutter. One of them spoke with a smile.
“Indeed, hiding ourselves only make us suspicious. Are you a traveler?”
“Yes. Is the other person not among you?” Kino asked.
“… No, he’ll come out soon,” the two answered.
A man resembling the other two came out from the forest. Together, they introduced themselves as citizens of a country across the mountain range.
Hermes asked, “What are you doing in this kind of place? Are you collectors of weird stuff, or something?”
The three looked at each other. And then,
“Miss traveler, mister motorrad, can you keep a secret? We have an interesting story to tell you…”
“No I can’t, so I’ll pass. Bye then.” As Kino was about to ride Hermes, the three stopped her in a panic.
“Well, don’t say that. It’s a really interesting story. It would make a great souvenir for your travels, don’t you think? … The truth is we are a scouting party from a country seven mountains across here. We disguised ourselves as woodcutters, and observe the travelers coming out from that country.”
“Why?” Hermes asked, his engine still turned on. The three grinned,
“Along with the rising of the sun after the descent of the next full moon, we will invade that country and kill everyone.”
“Eh?”
“What do you mean?” Kino asked calmly.
“It’s exactly as you heard. On the next full moon, as soon as the sun rises, we will invade that country and kill every single one of its residents without leaving a single one alive. Then we will destroy it thoroughly. We have to make sure that not a single thing remains of that country.”
“Why why why?” Hermes asked in surprise, then he added, “——because of the prophecy?”
The three were startled at the same time. They exchanged glances, and then,
“Yes! Exactly! Because of the prophecy! … You sure know a lot!”
“What do you mean?” Kino repeated her question.
The three, who suddenly became in the mood to chat, answered, “There was a certain prophecy in our country. A long time ago, a prophet left a book of prophecies. Twenty years ago, a man immigrated in our country and succeeded in deciphering the book. It predicted terrible things. Floods, epidemics, accidents, and disasters up until now, were all guessed correctly. As soon as something happened, that scholar would show it to us and say, ‘See, as I thought it was here. The number of pages and lines correspond to the year and month it occurred.’”
“……”
“……”
“And you know, the very end of that book predicts the end of the world! We were horrified by it, but the sole and flawless way to avoid it was also written there!”
“What is it?” Hermes asked.
“The final chapter of the book says this: ‘After the nineteenth full moon shines in the evening sky, the world will end at the rising of the sun. The one and only road left for us is to smash the green plate.’ This refers to the nineteenth full moon this year; that is, next month’s full moon. At the same time as the rising of the sun after that, the world will end. But—— the other half of the prophecy tells us of a way to avoid it: ‘smashing the green plate’ is the only way.”
“And so, that country…”
The three nodded.
“Yes. You must have seen it yourself, miss traveler. That country had unusual walls and a gentle depression towards the center. It was the green plate. As expected of him, our scholar noticed that. He’s truly brilliant.”
“But isn’t wiping them out going overboard?”
“That’s outrageous, mister motorrad! Destroying that country is necessary to save the world. This is not only our problem. If the world ends, you too will vanish. According to our scholar, since it was not clearly stated how much we should ‘smash the plate’, we should do it thoroughly. I believe so too. In order to save this world, us, who knows the method, have to do what we can. ——The day after the nineteenth full moon. On our astronomer’s judgment, that will be the next full moon, that is, without counting the lunar eclipse. It’s going to happen soon. About this time, our country should be finalizing the preparations.”
“I see…,” Kino muttered. And then, “Thanks for the story. We’ll have to excuse ourselves now.”
At that moment, the three quickly stood in front of Kino as if trying to surround her.
“Say, do you think we can just let you go home upon learning this much? If you return to that country and tell them about this, it will be troublesome. We will not be able to save the world. As a souvenir for your travel to the underworld, please do not forget about the prophecy, and about us.”
The three took out machetes from behind their hips, and attacked instantaneously from three sides.
Kino fell backwards like a plank that lost its support. The three blades cut nothing but air. Kino lay on the road face up, Canon in her right hand and Woodsman in her left.
Bang. Bang. Bang.
The dry sounds continued without pause, and the three heavy, loud explosive sounds that followed reverberated in rhythm.
The three, who had tiny holes and big holes opened in their throats, collapsed.
Kino got up.


“… That was unexpected.”
While stuffing bullets and liquid gunpowder inside Canon, Kino spoke. “That I would be able to deal with trouble like this, that I would be this good in using persuaders… A long time ago… I wouldn’t have imagined as much when I first met Master. But saying that after all this time feels a bit…”
“No one knows what the future holds. Like they say, ‘the road ahead is an unknown world.’”
“I wonder if it’s right thing… or not…?” Kino tilted her head as she finished loading. Then she returned Canon to its holster.
Kino looked around to check if she has forgotten anything. There was nothing, other than the three machetes, and the three corpses.
“Shall we go then? ——I have no idea what awaits us though,” Kino said as she went astride Hermes.
“Ro-ger,” Hermes answered.
Kino started the engine.















"
22,v3c6,3,6,"There was a prairie and a lake.
The flat earth was covered in grass and trees as far as the eye could see. Clear water from underground bubbled out to fill small ditches, forming several small ponds.
The bright summer sun illuminated the vegetation on the ground and in the water. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky. The blue, dry atmosphere extended everywhere.
There was one way through the prairie.
It was a narrow road, and judging from the grass growing on it, it didn’t seem to have seen much traffic. Avoiding the lake, the road extended roughly from east to west.
One motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle) was running west down the road, fully loaded with travel luggage on its back, both sides, and on top. A silver cup strapped to the side of the bag was rattling as the motorrad sped along the path.
The rider was wearing a white shirt under an open black vest. Around her waist was fastened a thick belt with a hand persuader (Note: A gun) holster on her right thigh and a slender automatic one holstered against her lower back.
The rider wore a brimmed hat with goggles over her black hair. Under the hat was the rider’s young face. She seemed to be in her mid-teens.
“There’s a horse. See it, Kino?” the motorrad said suddenly while riding.
Kino, the rider, narrowed her eyes under her goggles at the road ahead.
“Yeah, I see it. Looks like someone’s there.”
Kino released the handle with her left hand to check the persuader against her back and then the revolver at her thigh with her right hand.
“I’m stopping, Hermes.”


On the side of the road was a horse, laden with luggage, drinking from the lake. Near it was a man with a hat over his face, sleeping on his back. The sound of the motorrad’s engine woke him.
The young man, who appeared to be in his twenties, wore riding pants and boots, a thin jacket, and a hand persuader holster on his right hip containing a .45 caliber automatic.
The man waved to the approaching motorrad.


“Hey,” he called out to Kino as she brought the motorrad to a stop.
Kino got off the motorrad and put down the kickstand, leaving the engine running.
“Hello.”
“Howdy.”
Kino and Hermes, her motorrad, greeted him.
“Are you from the country up ahead?” the man asked.
“No. We’re on our way there now,” Kino replied.
“Great, I was just on my way there myself. How about going together? That way you could take half my load for me. It oughta be light for a motorrad,” asked the man matter-of-factly.
“I can’t do that,” replied Kino, just as straightly, with Hermes chiming in with agreement.
The man frowned, openly showing his annoyance, “Well aren’t you a cold one. You can’t even do that simple thing?”
“That’s right,” Kino answered with a polite smile. “If I did that, I could just take all your stuff and run. Then I’d get there first and sell it all.”
Kino turned away in disinterest and the man tut-tutted in disapproval.
“Well, that’s alright… But by the way!” The man looked at Kino as if staring right into her. “Do you know about that country? Have you heard what kind of country it is?” the man asked.
“I don’t know any details, but I’ve heard that it’s a very gentlemanly country,” replied Kino.
The man burst into laughter and said with a smirk, “Who told you that?! That’s completely wrong!”
“What did you hear?”
The man laughed again. “Heh heh heh. Guess it can’t be helped. I’ll enlighten ya, since it’s so amusing. About that country… they call it the ‘Land of Permitted Murder’.”
“Sorry, what was that?” Hermes asked.
“By law, murder isn’t prohibited. You can’t steal, but hurting and killing people and every other crime like that isn’t prosecuted. It’s like it’s the murdered person’s fault more than the murderer’s. It’s a jungle in there, just inside the walls. It’s a pretty well known story,” said the man, who seemed to be enjoying himself.
“And you want to go there then?” Kino asked.
“Yeah, of course. I’ll live there. My home country has ludicrously good security and everyone’s on stupidly good terms with each other. I absolutely despised it. It was always ‘laws, laws, laws’ there, so did ‘em a favor and ditched the place.”
“So, how do you become a citizen of this other country?” asked Hermes.
“I dunno… at this point I’ll just live there and see how it goes.” The man paused, “If there’s a guy I don’t like, I’ll beat him to death. Seems like a good place for someone like me,” he said, acting cool.
“Hmm… That doesn’t sound very interesting to me,” Hermes replied. The man looked offended.
“Well besides that, there’s someone I look up to in that country. Maybe you guys have heard of him? That ‘Mr. Legal’[1].”
“No.” “Don’t know him.” Kino and Hermes said shortly.
“I guess you guys really are from out of town.” The man paused in amazement for a moment and then started to gladly and quickly explain. “That ‘Mr. Legal’, he’s from a big country to the south where he’s the leader of a band of robbers and terrorists and is a well-known serial killer. He accidentally got himself caught, but was such a tough guy that he escaped just before the hanging and fled the country. That’s already decades in the past, but he still hasn’t been caught so it’s almost certainly like they say, that in the end, murderers end up in that country. They say assassins and killers from all over the world gather in that country. So surely he’d be free to kill as much as he wants. I really look up to him and would love to meet him. I wish I could tell you even more!”
“I see. Well, with that we’ll be off then,” Kino said, climbing back onto Hermes.
“You’re a boring one… Hey,” the man called out to stop Kino, glaring at her. “You really can’t carry anything for me?”
“Yes, please carry your own travel luggage,” said Kino, as though stating the obvious, and immediately started up Hermes.
The man was left surrounded in the roar of the engine.
He looked over his shoulder as they drove off. “Fine. I swear, if I see them again inside that country…,” he muttered to himself and laughed.


Walls connected to the lake with aqueducts and canals that had been dug outside. The white stone walls towered tall above them.
It was evening when Kino and Hermes arrived near the gate. As soon as they arrived, the bridge over the canal slowly lowered down.
“So, a country where they don’t prohibit murder… I bet there’ll be some amazing things in there,” Hermes said, seemingly enjoying himself.
“Probably so.”
“You ready?”
“As ready as I’ll ever be.”
“You don’t need to do any preparations for your persuader?”
“I always do them, so it’ll be fine. Now then, shall we go?” Kino replied and started crossing the bridge.


“Do you wish to immigrate? Or are you traveling and wish to stay for a short time?” an immigration officer inquired to Kino from inside a small guardroom outside the gate.
Kino told him that they were the latter and would like to stay for three days.
“Are you aware that this country does not legally prohibit murder? Regardless of whether you are a citizen or a traveler, within this country, killing for any reason will not be considered a crime. Do you understand?” the immigration asked as a precaution.
Kino nodded.
“Knowing this, you still wish to enter the country?” the immigration inspector asked again.


“Strange country, isn’t it?” Kino said while taking down the luggage from Hermes.
Inside the hotel room, there was a simple chair and bed, as well as a lamp and fan placed along the wall. In the corner was a fireplace, sealed shut so it could not be used.
“You think so? I was thinking that it was pretty normal,” Hermes replied, propped up on his center stand in the corner of the room.
“That’s what I mean. And besides that, the town is beautiful and even in the evening there are a lot of people out walking around. The people aren’t nervous and there don’t appear to be many police officers in town. The stores didn’t have any sturdy shutters either. And they’re kind to travelers as well.”
After passing through the city walls, Kino and Hermes had ridden for a while through farmland. When they asked directions to a hotel in town, the people nearby gathered and had happily shown them the way.
Hermes asked, “In other words?”
“What I’m saying is that the public order here is very good, and that’s what’s strange,” Kino replied.
“Ah, I see. Since murder isn’t legally prohibited, were you hoping for gangs of ruffians strutting around, women fighting in bars, and dogs trotting around biting people’s hands? That’s too bad,” said Hermes.
“Well, I wouldn’t really say I was hoping for it…”
Kino unloaded her luggage next to the bed, took off her holster and vest, and removed the revolver called ‘Canon’ from her right thigh.
“Or perhaps…” Kino murmured to herself while she looked at the Canon’s black luster.
“Perhaps what?” asked Hermes.
“Well, whatever. You might understand eventually.” Without saying a word more, Kino laid down on the bed with Canon still resting on her chest.
“What’s that? … I guess there’s no point in asking any more. Goodnight.”


The next morning, Kino woke at dawn as always.
She opened the window and shutters. A quiet street and a clear blue sky with thin streaks of clouds stretched out before her eyes.
Kino warmed up with some light exercises, then began training with her Canon and Woodsman, the automatic she kept on her back. She repeatedly practiced her quick draw, rapidly pulling each gun from its holster to a firing position. Afterwards, she disassembled the guns and cleaned them before returning them and the cleaning oil to their holsters.
After taking a shower, Kino got some breakfast from the hotel. With the sun risen, she tapped Hermes awake and left the hotel.
The town was lined with old stone buildings. Along both sides of what seemed to be the main street were shops, the upper floors of which had apartments.
Kino went into a store and sold the things she didn’t need as well as other sellable items from her travels, then bought the things she needed. Once the good-hearted, middle-aged shopkeeper learned that Kino was a traveler, he gave her a bargain.
Behind his chair, a long rifle-type persuader was propped up. Kino asked whether it was for defending against robberies, but the shopkeeper shook his head.
“We’ve never had a robber in this store or the neighboring stores. This,” the shopkeeper answered, “is for killing people.”
“Hmm… When?” Hermes asked.
“Hm? Who knows when… I know the sort of situations, but I don’t know when they’ll arise, so I always just keep it around,” the shopkeeper replied with a laugh.
“I see,” Kino murmured quietly.


After they had finished shopping, Kino and Hermes rode around to see the country. The country was not very big and by the afternoon they had finished their tour and returned to the main street.
They found a restaurant with tables alongside the street and Kino took a seat, with Hermes behind her chair. A cool breeze passed through in the shade.
Kino asked the waiter if they had anything sweet and was told that there was the recommended special. Without really knowing what it was, she ordered it.
“Here you are. Please take your time.”
“……”
What came out was a cream crepe of tremendous size, piled up like a mountain on a huge plate.
“……”
“Kino?”
“Everything’s a challenge.”
Kino attacked it with a knife, chopping it up roughly until, after some time, she had eaten all of it. Hermes just watched in amazement.
A short while after she finished eating, a number of elderly people came and sat down in a group around Kino.
Having found Kino, an elderly lady from among them asked, “Hey, are you the traveler?”
Kino said yes and the old woman said that they had just finished their hobby of dancing and that they always came to that shop to eat afterwards, so naturally they came today too, and continued on about things that Kino didn’t particularly ask about.
“So traveler, don’t you think this country has very good public order?” the old woman asked.
“Yes, it’s very good,” Kino said honestly.
A man in the group with a cane and a long white beard asked Kino, “Where are you heading?”
“I don’t know,” Kino answered.
“Well then, do you know, mister motorrad?” the old man asked.
“You kidding?” Hermes replied, the pitch of his voice rising at the end.
“Hm… Well then, how about moving to this country?” said the old man.
“Yes, that’s a great idea! Why don’t you do that? We’ll help you out and can find a place for you to live as early as tomorrow, then it’s just a simple matter of procedure down at the town hall, you’ll just need to sign your name on the paper and then—”
Then, softly ignoring the old woman who was talking as fast and loudly as a machine gun, the old man said to Kino, “How about it? I think this country would be well-suited for a person like you.”
“What kind of person is that?” Hermes asked from behind the chair.
The bearded old man answered with a smile, “A person who can kill people.”
“……”
Kino paused for a while and then shook her head.
“Is that so? That’s too bad… But I hope you’ll have a relaxing stay. Traveling is dangerous business, so hopefully being here a bit will put your mind at ease.”
“Thank you. I’ll take you up on that.”
“I wonder what you’d think of this country’s sweets? They’re really quite nice; I think they’d make a good souvenir for your travels. Then we could talk a little about matters outside the city walls instead,” the old man suggested. Kino shook her head with a chagrined face.
Hermes explained, “Sorry, she just finished stuffing herself with those sweets.”
“Ah, is that right? Well then, how about tea tomorrow morning?”


The next day. Specifically, it was the morning of the third day since Kino had entered the country.
Kino got up at dawn. She did her light exercises and persuader training, took a shower as though reluctant to part with it, and had breakfast.
She arranged the luggage and piled it up on Hermes, securely fixing it to him.
She tapped Hermes awake and headed out to the restaurant on the street. The bearded old man from the day before was leisurely drinking tea. Kino was stopped by the old man and they talked about the state of the neighboring countries. The old man squinted his eyes and seemed to greatly enjoy listening. Then he treated Kino to tea and dessert and the two of them divided up the mountain of it and ate it together.
“I’m afraid we’ll have to be going soon,” said Kino as the restaurant began to get crowded with the noon rush.
“Is that so… Well, thank you, I honestly enjoyed our time,” the old man said politely with a bow, which Kino reciprocated.
Kino pushed Hermes back out to the street. She started the engine and the sound echoed out, somewhat disrupting the quiet of the town.
On the street, Kino nodded to the old man with the cane just as she put Hermes into gear.
“You!! I found ya! Stop right there!” shouted a loud voice. “It’s you! You on the motorrad with the black vest!”
The man Kino had seen outside the country two days before came screaming out of a building. Kino cut Hermes’ engine. The street became quiet.
“This place is just perfect. Don’t move!”
All the people in the area were paying close attention to the man. He approached Kino, who got off Hermes and kicked down his side stand.
“What is it?” Kino asked, standing in front of Hermes.
“The luggage you’ve got on your motorrad, put it all on the ground!” said the man, who stood a short distance away.
“May I ask what for?”
“I’ll take it for ya. It must be pretty heavy, right? So I’ll help ya lessen the weight. I’ll take it all, use what I can use, sell what I don’t need, and use it for my living expenses. Sounds like a plan?”
“I understand, but I couldn’t possibly trouble you so much. I refuse,” Kino said.
The man cackled and added, “If you refuse, I’ll kill you here and now. I’ll ask again. If you value your life, leave your luggage and go. Don’t worry, I’m not gonna take your clothes off or anything. How about it?”
The man glanced to the holster on his right hip, where a loaded hand persuader could be seen.
The people who were in the street started pulling away into buildings.
“So you immigrated then, huh?” Kino said.
“Of course! I’m now a citizen of this country.”
“But you don’t act like one,” said Kino.
The man frowned.
“Huh…? That stuff doesn’t matter. What’s your reply?”
Kino looked to her left and right. No one was in the streets, but she could see shadows in the second floor windows of the buildings.
“We refuse. Since we’re already leaving the country.”
“I guess there’s no more negotiating then…”
The man spread his feet shoulder-width apart and shook out his hands and shoulders.
“Hermes… Sorry but, could you give me a sec?” Kino said quietly.
“Understood. Just patch up the holes afterward, alright?” Hermes replied.
The man pulled out his persuader from his waist. Kino reacted quickly and twirled out of the way.
“?”
She took cover, crouching behind Hermes.
“… Huh? What are you doing? Coward! You didn’t even draw?! Is that thing on your waist just for decoration?” the man howled, thrusting his persuader forward with his right hand and taking a step closer to Hermes.
“Don’t take it personally.” The moment he said it, an arrow came flying at an angle from above, hitting his right arm.
The persuader fell. The man looked at his arm. Where the arrow pierced his arm, blood flowed and dripped.
“Uwah—!”
Just as he cried out in pain, another arrow came flying and hit the inside of his left foot, piercing his boot and pinning it to the ground.
“Gyah—!” The man was in agony. He couldn’t remove the arrows from his foot or his arm.
“OWWWWCH—!! Dammit! Damn it!!”
The townspeople gathered quietly around the screaming man. Everyone’s face was calm, and they were all holding some sort of weapon. A man holding a big knife. A youth readying a persuader. A young woman holding a club. A woman came out from an apartment with a crossbow.
Kino looked out at the scene, peeking out half of her face from behind Hermes’ tank.
“Hey! The hell’d you do that for?! Damn it hurts…”
The old man with the cane approached the man and spoke.
“It’s no good… You can’t do that. That’s why we stopped you.”
“W-What…? Damn it! Hurry up and take these out, will ya?!”
“I’ll answer your question,” the old man said quietly. “Here, in this country… The act of killing people is not allowed.”
The man glared at the elderly man.
“What? You liar! This is the country where murder isn’t prohibited! That’s why I bothered to come here in the first place!”
“You’re right. You aren’t mistaken about that. That’s why we’re here.” The surrounding people chimed in calmly with agreement.
“W-What are you saying? What are you talking about? Hey! You bastard! I don’t get a thing you’re sayin’! Hurry up and take out these arrows! I’ll beat ya to death!”
“I can’t do that. In this country, people who have killed others, people who have tried to kill others, and people who try to kill others, all of them have ended up being killed themselves.”
“So why then?! Murder’s not illegal, right?! That’s why I came! ‘Cause you didn’t stop murderers!” the man ranted in confusion.
The quiet old man’s voice continued, “Saying it’s not prohibited doesn’t mean that it’s allowed.”
“… Quit screwing with me! Who the hell do you think you are anyway, your majesty?”
The old man narrowed his eyes, which were surrounded by wrinkles.
“Who, me? I’m no one deserving of being called ‘majesty’. I’m just one citizen, an old man by the name of Legal.”
“Wha…?”
The man looked up at Legal with his mouth hanging open.
“Sorry, but you are dangerous.” Legal twisted the handle of his cane and pulled to reveal a sword painted a glossy black. With his weight behind it, he pierced the man’s heart with the sword. And then he twisted and pulled it out.


The old man with the cane gently closed the eyes of the dead man, and everyone who was there took a moment of silence.
Kino had been watching the scene from behind.
“The death of a fellow man is always a painful thing,” someone said, and everyone nodded. Someone requested that arrangements be made for the National Cemetery and someone else took on that responsibility.
Then everyone went their separate ways and returned to where they had been before.
Legal approached Kino and just said, “Take care, alright?”
“Alright,” Kino replied and started Hermes’ engine. The sound of the engine rang out, somewhat disturbing the quiet of the town.
Kino nodded to the elderly man with the cane from the street and put Hermes into gear.


The motorrad rode west along a road between a meadow and a lake. While riding along the edge of the lake, their image was reflected with the sky’s on the surface of the lake.
“There’s a horse. See it, Kino?” Hermes said suddenly while riding. Kino narrowed her eyes under her goggles at the road ahead.
“Yeah, I see it. Looks like someone’s there.” Kino released the handle with her left hand to check the persuader against her back and then the revolver at her thigh with her right hand.
“I’m stopping, Hermes.”


On the side of the road was a horse laden with a large amount of luggage, drinking from the lake. Near it was a man with a hat over his face, sleeping on his back. The sound of the motorrad’s engine woke him.
The young man, who appeared to be in his twenties, wore riding pants and boots, a thin jacket, and a hand persuader holster on his right hip containing a .40 caliber automatic.
The man waved to the approaching motorrad.


“Hey,” he called out to Kino as she brought the motorrad to a stop.
Kino got off the motorrad and put down the kickstand, leaving the engine running.
“Hello.”
“Howdy.”
Kino and Hermes greeted him.
“Are you from the country to the east of here?” the man asked, and Kino shook her head.
“No, I’m traveling. I was in that country for three days and I just left a little bit ago.”
“Is that so… There’s something I’d like to ask but…”
“What might that be?”
The man’s face clouded and he said in a serious tone, “I heard from a traveler I met by chance that that country is safe and pleasant, and that it’s a gentlemanly place, so that’s why I came here.” Then he asked, “… is that true?”
“Yes, you’re not mistaken,” Kino replied and the man’s face relaxed. “But that might depend somewhat on what your feelings are,” added Kino.
“My country? Yeah, it was a rough place… Security was the worst. Every day there were multiple murders. I even had to kill and steal from God knows how many people to protect my own life. Even they would’ve liked to have a normal life… I don’t want to kill anyone anymore. So I left that unpleasant country and now I want to live in a safe one.”
“I see. In that case, I think you’ll definitely like the country up ahead. There’s an old man there named Mr. Legal, who it’d be nice if you could visit. If you talk about stories from your travels, I think he’d tell you lots of things too.”
“That right? Thanks for the tip,” the man said.
After that, Kino asked the man all about the road ahead and the country she was heading to next and the man told her honestly what he knew.
Kino thanked him and made to leave.
“Oh, there was one more thing I wanted to ask…,” the man called out and stopped her. “In fact, I heard one strange thing concerning that country when I was in the neighboring country. But could it really be true…? If you happen to know any details…”
“What sort of thing?” Kino asked.
The man hesitated a little and shook his head. “Nah, it’s fine. It’s so strange, I don’t even believe it. It’s too disconnected from common sense. It’s something I’d find out as soon as I get there anyway, so I’ll just find out with my own eyes.”
“Is that so… Well then, I think we’ll be going now.”
“Right, bye then.”
The motorrad drove off and the man got on horseback and headed east. While rocking on top of the horse, 
“Is it really true…?” he muttered. “That in that country they pile up crepes like mountains.”















"
23,v3c7,3,7,"The sun has only risen halfway through when a traveler arrived at the gate. The sky was clear and sunny and the wind was cold.
The traveler came riding a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly). Boxes were mounted on both sides of the rear wheel, while a big bag was strapped on top of it.
The rider was wearing a brown coat, the long hem of which was rolled up to her thighs. She was wearing a hat with flaps covering her ears, eye goggles, and a bandana wrapped around her face for protection from the cold.
In the guard post outside the gates, the traveler introduced herself.
“Hello. I am Kino. This is my partner, Hermes. We hope to stay for three days.”
The guard politely asked some questions, and then issued an entry permit to the traveler who identified herself as Kino and to the motorrad called Hermes.
The guard asked if she has something like a persuader (Note: A gun), and Kino replied with a nod.
“Are persuaders not allowed?” asked Kino.
“Not at all. It’s the other way around,” the guard answered with a smile.


Kino finally entered the country after passing through the white walls.
The interior of the country was flat and spacious. As a result, the roads and building sites were also wide, and there were many one-storey buildings. There were also numerous new buildings.
While waiting and reading the map she got, a guide came riding a small car. It was a kind-looking elderly man.
For a while, Kino had to listen to some welcoming remarks while she was led to a hotel by car. They passed through a wide and crowded street, and headed towards the central part of the country.
Upon arrival at the hotel, the guide talked more about the country.
This country grew from the merger of two countries 17 years ago. Until then, the land here now was just a territory of a tiny kingdom. On the other hand, far beyond the mountains, there was a democratic country with a very high population density.
One day the king lost his mind, and as a small country all they could possibly do was to seek help and cooperate with the other country. The other country, which was having trouble with their small land, accepted the offer. By becoming a democratic country, everyone was given the right to equality, and the two countries peacefully integrated. The king was sent to stay in a hospital.
In this country, all people between ages 18-50 were required to be registered as soldiers. They were being trained on a regular basis, and weapons were stored in every house in case they were summoned to fight in times of war. For that reason, shooting has become a very popular national sport in this country.
“I see,” Kino muttered as she recalled the words of the guard.


From noon, Kino and Hermes went around the country.
Kino acquired supplies for Hermes’ maintenance, and shopped some more for the things she needed.
Near the walls, there was a sign saying ‘Public Shooting Range’. Upon looking closely, an immense ground was laid out for it. The manager who came out told them that the facility was closed just for the day due to maintenance.
Kino introduced herself, and asked if she can practice shooting.
“Then, by all means please come tomorrow. You are free to use the facility as much as you want, and if it’s not too much trouble, please do teach us some things,” the manager answered with glittering eyes.


The second day.
As usual, Kino got up at the crack of dawn.
As always, she performed her light body exercises and practiced drawing out her persuaders.
“……”
She thought for a bit, and then continued.
After eating, Kino slapped Hermes awake, and headed to the shooting range.
In the shooting range, a lot of people had gathered early in the morning, from commoners to groups of people wearing military uniforms.
When Kino came, the manager she met the day before delightfully introduced her to everyone. When they were informed that she travels while protecting herself with her persuader, everyone thought this amazing and excitedly asked her to teach them various things.
“If you’re bad at this, you shouldn’t show off at all,” said Hermes.


In the shooting range, various shooting equipment, from point-blank to ultra-long-distance ones were available. For each one a convenient device was attached — an automatically moving target and a screen that can show where a distant target was hit.
In the annex of the facility, target dolls, women holding babies, and children with knives could be seen coming out from the windows and side corridors.
While a large number of people were observing, Kino borrowed some of the facilities. She carried out her shooting practice with ‘Canon’ and her other automatic-style hand persuader ‘Woodsman’.
Kino was applauded every time she hit something.
“Well, it’s not that easy…,” she murmured
“Master told you, hasn’t she? Keep your presence of mind in any kind of situation,” said Hermes.


“Miss Kino, don’t you have a rifle with you?” The manager asked Kino while she was having lunch in the cafeteria. Kino shook her head.
“Aren’t you worried that you don’t have a long-ranged weapon?”
Kino replied that surely, there were times when she felt like having one, but the thought of carrying a long rifle on Hermes was completely unreasonable.
Upon hearing this,
“I have exactly what you are looking for,” the manager said gleefully, sounding like a salesman.


“Thank you for waiting. Here it is.”
After the meal, the manager put on top of the table a box containing a rifle.
The rifle was divided into two portions. The first half consists of a black metal frame with a prominently long cylinder attached on its side. The second half includes a wooden stock and a sniper’s scope.
“It is a silencing, automatic-type rifle that can be disassembled for easy transportation. It was the latest weapon developed in our country, and cleared problems in accuracy and strength. The provisions for our military has just started.”
The manager advised Kino to try it out. Kino assembled the rifle according to an illustrated manual beside her.
“How is it? What do you think?”
Kino said that the handling wasn’t bad and it seemed very easy to use.
“Won’t you try shooting? Try it and please tell us what you think,” the manager said.
Kino headed to the shooting range, and tried shooting with the borrowed rifle. She tried aiming on a far target using the scope placed on the cushion on top of the desk.
Each time a shot hits the black center of the target, the crowd behind her breaks into applause.
“Are you used to it yet?”
“I’m already familiar with it.”
Hermes asked, and Kino answered with a shot. Cheers arose.
After several shots, she was met with a barrage of questions.
To a person who asked her who taught her how to shoot,
“I’m sorry. I can’t tell you that,” Kino answered.
To another person who asked her what kind of excellent facilities she practiced in,
“In the forest…,” Kino answered.
To yet another person who asked her to at least tell him how she attained such a level,
“…. But I don’t like recollecting painful experiences…” Kino answered.


Halfway through the afternoon.
Kino, Hermes and the manager were around a table in the dining room while having dessert.
“Wow, Miss Kino is so wonderful. Everyone was surprised. All of a sudden everyone is so motivated.”
“Well, she has to live up to her reputation. It’s nice to see Kino get praised once in a while,” Hermes said.
“The more we train our shooting skills, the more we strengthen our country’s defense. And as a result we can better protect our peace and safety.”
“Does this country have potential enemies?” Kino asked. The manager answered looking slightly embarrassed.
“That is… The truth is this country, and the two separate countries before the merger, has never been at war. Apparently, there are no offensive countries nearby. Even though all of the citizens are drafted as soldiers, none of them have shot anything other than paper and dolls. And so, I have no idea how long we would last in an actual battle. We never miss practice, and I can brag that each one of us is competent, but…”
Kino spoke. “Peace is a very good thing to have. I think that in times of emergency, we will see the result of your training. I’m sure everyone can fight better than they think they can.”
“Oh. I’m glad to hear those words. From here on, we will work even harder in our training.”
“That’s the spirit. As they say, ‘If you are prepared, you don’t need ukulele,’[1]” said Hermes.
“Huh?” The manager gave them a puzzled look.
“Hermes… are you doing that on purpose?”
“Doing what?”


Evening.
The manager told Kino that if she wanted to, and if it will not interfere with her journey, he wouldn’t mind her having the rifle. They wanted their country’s excellent persuader to be of use in her journey.
Kino gave it a little thought, and politely expressed her gratitude upon accepting the offer. Kino asked for the name of the rifle.
“Name… Oh, nothing in particular. We call it by its abbreviation, ‘National Disassembly-Type Rifle No. 52.”
“That’s long.”
“Later, I will think of some name for it,” said Kino.


The third day.
During the morning, Kino went sightseeing around the country.
In the center, a palace from the times when the country was still a kingdom was still left standing. Its surroundings have been turned into a public park.
Upon being asked by Kino of his thoughts about the building,
“Not bad. It’s like this all the time, anywhere. The king must have been scowled by the public for using tremendous amount of money to build such a luxurious palace. And after he was removed from his position, it was made into a park. ‘Preserving a splendid building’, like they say. But during the king’s reign, they didn’t praise it the least bit,” Hermes said sarcastically.
In one corner of the park, there was a big black stone. The stone was like a wall.
Kino passed in front of it. Human figures were engraved on the stone. Young men, smiling, lined-up side by side.
“Excuse me. Is this a monument of some sort?” Kino asked a person who happened to pass by.
The man of about fifty years gave a big nod. “Oh, yes it is. This is a monument for heroes.”
“Heroes, is it?”
“Ah. For people like me who came here from the country beyond, it was an unforgettable event. Long before the merger, that was about thirty years ago. In the country where I was born, the population has grown too much that it was so cramped. But the walls couldn’t be extended further, and so we thought of sending out an expedition to look for new settlements. Twelve groups in every direction.”
“Uh-huh. And then?”
“And then, we recruited young men and formed teams with seven men in each. They were supposed to come back after half a year, whether they succeed or fail in finding a good land. Eleven of the teams returned.”
“I see. Then, these people are?”
“These seven, not a single one came back even after 10 years. It was the team that proceeded to the most dangerous mountain route. Probably, they met with some sort of accident…. In the country, we felt sorry for them, and erected a monument for them. Engraved on it was their appearance at the time of their departure. ——And then, a long time has passed. After the merger with this country has been made, we left most of the buildings in our country as is after moving; only this stone was painstakingly transferred here, so that we will never forget their heroic deeds. This story is even written in our school textbooks.”
Kino looked at the monument again. They were young and brawny men, with carefree smiles. They were carrying old-fashioned rifles, and hanging above their chests were pendants with the same design.
It was a small round pendant, with a star design.
The man spoke. “That’s right. I think you should visit our old country. To the west, just beyond two big mountain ranges, there is a basin. Even now, the country should still be there. The walls, the buildings were left just as they were. We can never go back there again because this place is our country now, you see. But miss traveler, if you somehow come to visit the apartments, you might find the old buildings where many people once lived interesting. Identical buildings are aligned side by side; the inner courtyard was always filled with many people, and as a child I played there often. It’s so nostalgic.”
“Is that so? I think I’ll go there and see.”
She thanked the man and after he left, Kino looked at the characters carved in the monument.
Underneath their smiles, there was an inscription.
‘——Even if our heroes do not come back, they will always be alive in our hearts——’[2]















"
24,v3c8,3,8,"Kino breathed out white air as she unloaded the bag from Hermes’ carrier. She was wearing a black jacket and a hat on her head, and her goggles remained strapped on her face. ‘Canon’ was hanging beside her right thigh.
She opened the bag. A disassembly-type rifle persuader was strapped on the inside of the cover.
“It looks like it will be useful right away, Kino.”
“Yeah, though I’m not very happy about it.”
The rifle was divided into two portions. The first half consists of a black metal frame, on the side of which, a prominently long cylinder was attached. The second half includes a wooden stock and a sniper’s scope.
“There’s seven of them.”
“That’s helpful.”
Kino connected the two parts of the rifle and locked them together. She pulled its leather sling strap up front. She took out a cloth shoulder bag from the box on one side of Hermes’ rear wheel. Inside was a magazine containing nine bullets, which she loaded into the rifle.
“Oh, right. Did you name that rifle after all?”
“I called it ‘Flute’.”
Kino released Flute’s bolt and loaded the first round. She briskly tucked the sash of the shoulder bag in a corner of her belt. While taking out Canon’s spare magazine from inside,
“Hermes.”
“Hmm?”
“If I do not come back, then by that time I got someone else to ride you.”
“Ok. Well, if possible, a person like you would be nice.”
Kino touched Canon on her right side. “I’ll try.”
She transferred the spare magazines inside the pouch.
“Just in case, I’m going to say it now. ——Goodbye Kino.”
“Yeah. ——Goodbye,” Kino answered.
“Yup. Then in that case, have a nice day. Never mind the souvenirs,” Hermes said in a tone of voice without any hint of tension.
“Sure, I’ll be going now,” Kino said with a face that was a little stern but with a hint of amusement.


Kino slowly put her head out from her spot.
Both sides of the street were lined up with identical apartment buildings. There was an arch leading to a courtyard. Hermes was parked and concealed in the interior of this courtyard.
Heavy clouds covered the surface of the sky, giving it a dull gray and overcast look. The cold wind blew strongly from time to time.
There was no sign of life between the three-storey brick buildings along the street, and broken glass windows are visible here and there. On the cobblestones, there were freely growing weeds and naturally-made dead tracks.
Kino rushed out and ran at full speed to the other side of the building.
At the moment Kino took cover beside the entrance stairs, a bullet came flying towards her, and quickly passed through to her side. The fierce hum of the bullet that sped past the speed of sound resonated.
“There you are,” Kino muttered, as she saw a person’s silhouette with a poised rifle on the other side of the street.
She then dodged and disappeared to the side of the building.


“He went out. He’s fast,” a tall man said.
“So it was a young person. He abandoned the motorrad, eh… He has a rifle too. Be alert,” a bald man holding a pair of binoculars said. The men around him nodded.
There were seven men.
A bald man. A very short man. A bearded man. A big, muscular man. A man wearing a thick hat. A tall and skinny man. A man carrying a big rucksack.
Everyone appeared to be over fifty years of age. They were wearing similar clothes that were full of cloth patches — heavy pants and jacket of a navy blue color. Belts with pouches for ammunition were wrapped around their waists and chests. Only the bald man was wearing a hand persuader holster on his right hip.
Everyone was grasping rifle-type persuaders in their hands. For every shot, the ejection pod had to be manually reloaded, bolt-action style. The rifles have wooden stocks.
The tall man who had fired the shot earlier expertly operated the bolt to reload. His was the only one with a sniper’s scope attached to it.
The bald man spoke. “Let’s follow him.”


With their persuaders positioned by their hips, the men slowly moved forward along the walls of the houses on both sides of the street.
As they passed in front of the courtyard where Hermes was parked, they silently peeked at the alley where Kino had been hiding. There was no other place she could hide in on both sides of the alley.
Without raising their voices, the men moved according to the direction the bald man pointed out with his left arm. They advanced without hesitation, one pair at a time, while providing back-up to each other.
They came out of the narrow alley to a neighboring street that looked similar. There was nobody.
The man with the hat who went first found barely visible footprints. When the men returned to their hiding place in the alley, the bald man spoke. “He escaped to the east.”
“There are many wide roads in the eastern district. It will be difficult for him to hide,” the rucksack-carrying man said from the side.
“He probably doesn’t know. That’s good for us.” Next to him, the very short man said with a laugh.
Shortly after,
“No. —That guy must have escaped leeward. The sounds will not reach here, but the sounds will reach that place,” the tall man said. The wind that blew through the street wound up in the alley. A thin cloud of dust rose up.
“……”
The men looked at each other silently. They breathed out white air.
The bald man gave several small nods, and then spoke.
“Don’t let down your guard. That guy was better than I thought. At this rate, he will be cornered once he reaches the eastern border. Kill without hesitation.”
“Okay,” “Understood,” the men replied nervously.


The street in between the apartments extended straight to the east. It ended in a park full of dead trees, where it was divided into two directions.
On the side of the street with buildings, the men separated into two groups and silently moved forward. The park at the end of the street looked small.
Going first, the man with the hat traced the footprints. He carefully walked with his persuader positioned low beneath his waist. The footprints on the right side of the street continued straight to the park.
The men proceeded quietly. They approached the park until the shapes of the dead trees could be clearly seen. Suddenly, the man with the hat stopped. He raised his left fist up to his shoulder, and the men behind him halted. At the same time, everyone looked out in all directions, and the last two people in the line aimed their persuaders to the back.
“……”
The man with the hat looked the footprints at his feet with his sharp eyes.
From there, the footprints continued a bit and then suddenly vanished. On the other side, there were neither traces of jumping, nor a place to jump from.
The man with the hat slowly backed away by four steps.
He traced back his own footprints. He confirmed the depth of his own, as well as the footprints of their target. Then he turned his body and cautiously went back while carefully watching his every step. The other men observed in silence.
The man with the hat stopped in his tracks. There was a little hesitation in his footsteps. He noticed traces of jumping on the right side. When the man raised his head, he saw a dimly lit alley, blocked by the debris of a collapsed roof.
The man with the hat pointed his persuader towards the alley.
And then the man’s right thigh burst open. Blood and flesh scattered.
“Guh!”
Only a scream and the sound of a falling body were heard from the street.
“A sniper!” the large man shouted from a nearby wall. All the men clung to the wall for cover. The man who was shot twisted his body to an upright position, pressing down his right thigh with both hands. Fresh blood overflowed from the wound.
“From which direction?!” the bald man shouted.
With an anguished expression, the man with the hat attempted to raise his right hand to point. At that moment, a second bullet crushed his left knee.
“Gyah—!” The man with the hat writhed in pain. He tumbled face down, trembling and shaking while blood oozed from both of his legs.
“Damn! Where is he?!”
“There was no gunshot!”
“Which direction?!” The men shouted while clinging to the wall. They were looking out in front.


Kino has positioned Flute beside the debris, and was peeking through the scope. The cylinder from the side was screwed to the tip of the barrel. That suppressor (gunshot silencer) extinguished most of the gunshot’s sound.
From the scope’s view, on the main street at the end the dark and narrow alley, the man who fell down was clearly visible.
The man’s mouth was wide open.


“Gaaaaah!”
The man who was shot raised a scream. He was moving his arms, trying to crawl even if only a little to a safe place. He exerted himself, but barely moved.
“Wait! I’ll go!”
The large man left his persuader and removed his ammunition belt. Then he jumped out to save his fallen comrade.


Kino aimed at the new target, moved her aim a little, and fired.


“Don’t come out!”
At the same time as the bearded man’s scream, half of the head of the large man was blown off like a dropped tomato. Both of his hands were still turned towards the fallen man; and as he collapsed forward, his body made a blunt, loud noise. He stopped moving soon after.
The tall man saw the blood and brains fly out to the left, and screamed.
“To the right! Not in front! It was from the side alley!”
“Flares!” the bald man said, and the men lit and threw away the flares they had with them.
They dropped down and hit the alley wall as a dull purple smoke enshrouded them.


Just before the cloud thickened, Kino aimed and fired at the stomach of the man struggling on the ground.
After firing, Kino picked up the four empty cartridges by her side, and made her escape.


The smoke in the alley only lasted for a while before it was cleared away by the wind blowing from the main street.
The tall man established his aim to the back of the alley. Nobody was there anymore.
The bald man squatted beside the man with the hat.
His legs and stomach were stained a deep red. The rucksack-carrying man was desperately pressing down his clothes, but the pouring of the blood did not show any sign of stopping. He was slightly steaming up.
“I’m sorry…. I failed you, guys…,” the man with the hat said with a thin voice.
“Don’t talk,” the bald man said.
“Enough… I don’t see a thing anymore…” As tears flowed out from his big, gaping eyes, the man with the hat died.
“……”
The bald man gently closed his comrade’s eyes.
He searched the chest of the corpse and pulled out a pendant with its chain. It was a small, round pendant with a star design. He removed the chain and put it in his breast pocket.
Meanwhile,
“……”
The bearded man silently held out the large man’s pendant. The bald man took it and carefully placed it in his pocket like the other one. The clinking of the two metals made a small, dry sound.
The two corpses were placed on the stone pavement. Their faces were covered by cloth.
“We’ll bury them later. After killing that guy, that is,” the bald man said.
“The rifle that guy used was probably an automatic-fire type with a gunshot suppressor. Its accuracy was also good. It’s an excellent persuader,” the rucksack-carrying man said while aiming his persuader and looking at his surroundings.
The tall man nodded. “If only we have that, too.”
“It’s too late to talk about this. What we can do now is to do our best with what we have,” the bald man said monotonously.
The bald man spread a map he took out from his breast pocket. He held it in a way that wouldn’t let it get blown away by the wind. In the faded map, the appearance of the circular country was accurately drawn. At the end of several parallel streets heading to the east was a long park.
Across the park, a street with the same apartments continued on, and over there, the words ‘almost collapsed’ was written with a pen.
“Do you think he would run away just like this?” the tall man asked.
“If it were me, I will wait in ambush somewhere again. He would have come here without abandoning the motorrad but that engine is just too noisy,” the bearded man answered.
“Then… at the ‘street ruins’ across the park?” the rucksack-carrying man asked.
The bald man thought for a few seconds while looking at the map, and then spoke. “That makes sense. If he was thinking that we would give chase immediately, he wouldn’t waste his time crossing the park. He would be hiding in the building on the other side, let us get past and then annihilate us from behind in the park or the main street. What do you think?”
Without letting his vigilant eyes rest, the tall man said in a whisper, “If it were me, that’s what I would do. With an automatic-type, I’ll take on everyone at once.”
The bald man gave a small nod.
“We’ll divide into two groups and search the balcony from both corners of the park. ——We will outsmart him.”


“This is boring…” Hermes muttered.
In the deserted courtyard, the broken windows and clothes hung out to dry rustled as the wind blew.
“So boring…” When he muttered for a second time, a gunshot rang from afar.
“Oh, maybe Kino was done in already?” Hermes said, then he heard several shots in rapid succession.
“Oh, alive, still alive.”


“I was found so easily!” Kino said while running down the stairs of a building.
The short man and the rucksack-carrying man fired several rounds towards the third floor balcony where Kino was hiding.
Kino, who landed on the first floor, rushed through the living room and kicked open the doorway. At the same time, chipped wood scattered as two bullets that came flying bored two holes on the door.
“There are two people from the right… They separated into two groups, huh?”
Kino was in the eastern corner of the street, in the very last apartment facing the park. Right before its door was the road parallel to the park that ran north-south, and the expanse of the park with dead trees.
“I’ll be in serious trouble if I get cornered. There are only a few directions to go to…”
Kino went south inside the house and found a window made of frosted glass in the bathroom. She quietly raised open the dusty window and came out to the courtyard. She passed through an arch and went to a corner of a wide street that ran east-west. She lay down and put her arms around Flute, ready to shoot at any moment.
Kino spied towards the direction of the park. On the other side of the street was a similar entrance to a courtyard, and immediately to the left was a crossing on the main road to the park.
Around the corner of the building on the opposite side, the tip of the barrel of a rifle could be seen; right next to it was the face of the short man.
At the moment Kino hid her face, a bullet came flying and bounced on the stone pavement.
Kino got up and carried Flute. She pulled out Canon with her right hand, and fired one round towards the corner without taking aim.
The bullet flew towards the park, and the men backed away from the gunshot.
Kino immediately transferred Canon to her left hand. She dug her empty right hand to the cloth bag and took out one bottle. It was a medicine bottle containing a greenish liquid explosive. A short fuse was stuck in the mouth of the bottle.
Kino fired one shot from Canon to ignite the fuse. The bullet opened a hole in the courtyard wall.
She pitched the bottle with an under throw. The bottle slowly made its way diagonally across the street, and with a clink, dropped near the corner of the building without breaking.
Kino immediately squatted down, and covered the opening of her ears with both hands.


“Grenade!”
The short man who was crouching in the corner to aim, yelled as he saw the bottle thrown at him.
“Get down!”
The short man stood up and dropped down as his comrade pulled him. He got down with his feet pointed towards the corner.
The bottle exploded.


The explosion sent out large quantities of the characteristic white smoke of liquid explosives, covering the entire crossing.
This scene was also witnessed by the three men heading towards the battlefield from the north side of the park road. A second later, the low echo of the explosion was heard.
“Is that him?” the bearded man said.
The tall man peeped through the scope. As the white smoke quickly dissipated, he saw moving people through the crosshairs of the scope. The two fallen men were trying to get up.
“The two are still alive,” the tall man said, and the bald man spoke.
“Let’s join up. It’s dangerous in the streets; let’s exit through the courtyard. If you see him, shoot.”
The three men entered a nearby street. From the nearby courtyard, they passed through a building one after another.


The tall man guarded the south, while the bearded man took the north.
Over there, the stone pavement was dyed black from the explosion and fragments of the building were scattered about. Almost all of the glass windows nearby were broken.
The bald man looked at the two, and raised their upper bodies when he confirmed that there were no major injuries. He dragged them right next to the building and leaned them on the wall.
“Are you okay?”
The rucksack-carrying man shook his head a few times. Dust fell off him.
“My ears were badly injured… *cough!* Other than that, I’m fine.”
“I’m not gonna die yet,” the short man said. His face was covered by scratches. Blood was flowing down his cheeks. The hem of his pants was slightly burnt.
“Yeah…”
The bald man handed the rucksack-carrying man a bottle of water.
“Where did that guy disappear to…? Is he dead?” the short man asked while wiping away the blood from his cheeks.
The bald man answered. “No, he’s still alive. Like us, he used the explosion as a chance to continue through the courtyard. He was afraid of getting cornered, so he must have run to the south side. We can’t trace his footsteps in the dust.”
“Son of a bitch…,” the short man murmured with a hint of annoyance. There were cuts in his mouth, and blood dripped from it. The rucksack-carrying man silently passed him the water bottle.
The short man spewed out the water mixed with blood.
“There he is. Crossing the park,” the tall man said. He was sitting with one knee up, right elbow on his right knee. He was looking through the scope of the rifle poised on top of his left knee.
Everyone looked at the same direction. The bald man looked at the target with his binoculars.
The place was quite far to the south, in the park with dead grass and weeds. From there, the silhouette of the person running across looked like a grain of rice with the naked eye, but with binoculars, the shape of a rifle was clearly recognizable.
“It’s far. Can we get him?” the bald man asked.
“……”
The tall man silently twined the leather strap of his rifle on his left arm. He balanced the rifle and tried to catch the running opponent in the scope’s crosshairs. He slightly aimed higher and fired.
A high-pitched gunfire rang. The men looked at the target. The target continued to run.
He quickly loaded a second bullet.
“……”
The tall man fired. The target continued to run.
Third shot. A strong wind blew and raised a cloud of dust.
Fourth shot. The target continued to run.
The fifth round was fired. Only a little more and the target would have finished crossing the park, when the target fell forward.
“Did you get him?” the rucksack-carrying man asked from behind.
“Nope. He took cover,” the bald man said, looking through the binoculars.
“Why?”
The moment the short man asked this,
“Everybody down!” the bald man shouted. A figure aiming towards their direction was reflected in the binoculars.
“!”
In response, the men dropped down instantly.
Only the tall man, who was removing the last empty cartridge from his rifle, remained in his position.


As Kino heard the sound of the fifth bullet tearing through the air, she pretended to fall diagonally, prostrate on the dead grass. She then positioned Flute and looked through the scope. She soon saw the men drop down. She looked at the person who had been firing at her earlier.
Kino aimed at that man. The distance was considerably far, and the wind was blowing. She moved the crosshair a little diagonally upwards from where the man is.
She fired. And continued to fire.


No gunshot was heard. There was only the buzz of the bullets being incessantly fired, and the nearby stone pavement and brick buildings being chipped off soon after in succession.
The four men covered their heads with their arms while lying down. Only the tall man remained positioned on his empty persuader, glaring through its scope towards the person who was firing at them.
“……”
He glared in silence.


When the nine bullets of the magazine were spent, Flute’s bolt retracted and remained in its position.
The man in the scope’s view did not change his position.
“No good, huh… I thought at least one bullet would hit him.”
Kino stood up quickly, and while thin smoke was still rising from the heated barrel, she carried Flute under her arms and ran the remaining distance to the park.
She soon crossed it and entered the wide street.
Before her was a mountain of rubble.


“Let’s follow. Spread out horizontally. Avoid the front of the street where he fled, and cross the park immediately. He won’t be able to climb high up the ‘street ruins’. Be alert out front.”
As the bald man gave instructions, the prostrate men raised their heads. With their glittering eyes surrounded by creases, they stared towards the direction they’re heading to.
“Let’s go.”
The shoulder of the tall man, who still sat in his position, was tapped by the short man, whose face was now slanderous.
“Hey…,” the tall man said. A bead of sweat trickled down his cheek.
“What?”
The tall man took out five bullets from his ammunition pouch.
“That guy, that bastard…, I’ll kill him…”
He pushed the bullets firmly into the rifle, one bullet a time.
“Sure,” the short man nodded, helping up the man who was filling the rifle with bullets.
“I’ll definitely kill him,” the man who stood up said in a thunderous voice.
“I understand. ——Let’s go.”
The five men set off with the tall man going last.
Blood started to gradually seep out from the flank of his jacket.


There were five gunshots after the explosion. And then it became very silent.
“It’s not yet over? ——Could it be that Kino is having such a hard time? ——That, or she’s giving the other side a hard time?” Hermes complained.
“How boring…. Well, since the weather is bad, it’s not a bad idea to stay underneath this building. Finally it’s getting cold, but I wonder what Kino will do if the snow continues to fall. I don’t like to fall down every day…,” he complained once again. 


“There…,” the rucksack-carrying man said.
The road was filled with the collapsed portions from the destroyed second floors of the apartments on both sides. The rubble makes poor foothold, but created a number of hiding places. The men concealed themselves in a place where the rubble was around a man’s height.
“Hey,” the short man spoke to the tall man. He pointed to a hole in a collapsed wall on the left side.
“I’ll be the decoy. I’ll run to that hole, and if he shows his face, take him down. Whether it’s one of my arms or both, this time, be patient,” he said while grinning.
The bald man and the tall man looked at each other, then nodded.
The tall man clambered up the rubble, and slowly raised his head and persuader as much as he can.
“I’ll get you…,” he murmured.
“Let’s go!”
The short man jumped out. He pushed through the rubble and ran towards the hole. At the same time, the tall man rose up in a kneeling position. On the other side of the rubble, he saw the head and rifle of the opponent peeking out.
“?”
The tall man noticed that the opponent did not aim towards the man who had jumped out.
From the beginning, the opponent was aiming roughly towards his direction. At the moment he showed his face, the opponent finished adjusting the aim.
“……” 
The man ground his molars.


Kino fired.
The bullet instantly moved to the top of the rubble.
It hit the tall man’s wide open left eye, and penetrated to the back of his head.


When the man who ran and safely made it to the wall turned around, he saw blood spurting from the head of his fallen comrade.
“That bastard! Damn it!” the man screamed. He revealed himself from the hole and tried to aim, but in the next moment, his rifle burst flying. A second bullet grazed his right arm and made a scratch.
The man concealed himself in the hole, and then shouted. “There he is! Behind that car’s shade! Bottom left!”
At the end of the rubble where the men were concealed, there was an abandoned car smashed by collapsed bricks. The bald man showed his face for a moment to check.
“We’ll get him. A grenade. Distance, eighty.”
The rucksack-carrying man put down his rucksack and took out a rifle grenade from inside. The thick cylinder at the top contained blasting powder, while the narrow cylinder at its rear has a wing attached to it.
He opened the bolt of his own rifle, and inserted special blank ammunition for the wooden warhead. He plugged the grenade at the tip of the barrel, and erected the gun sight from the side of the rifle.
The bald man spoke. “Straight ahead.”
The rucksack-carrying man nodded. He pulled out the safety pin on the grenade’s tip. He pressed the rifle’s stock to the ground, adjusted the angle with the gun sight, and pulled the trigger.
Boom—!
The grenade made a big, heavy explosive sound as it was launched.


Kino reacted instantly when she heard the explosion. From the side of the car, she jumped to the right and ran six steps.
Behind her, the grenade exploded at the side of the car.


The bearded man gestured a thumbs-down to the man hiding behind the wall. The short man replied with a big shake of the head.
“He ran to the side! To the leftmost side of the street!”
“One more shot. A little to the left,” the bald man said.
The man put down the rucksack, quickly reloaded blank ammunition, and placed a grenade at the tip of the rifle. He aimed, and fired.


While dust and small stones dropped off Kino, she raised herself from her prone position. Then she sat on the top of the rubble, looking upward. The car that received a direct hit had all of its glass broken, and was reduced to scrap.
With the second explosion, Kino set up Flute. A black mass rose up in the cloudy sky.
Kino did not peek through the scope. From the bottom of the metal scope, she drew a high parabolic aim towards the mass and fired.


An explosion occurred mid-air in the street. The explosion left a black smoke, and fine debris scattered in the surrounding surface.
“What?” The man who launched the grenade raised a surprised voice.
“He shot it down! He shot down the grenade!” the short man shouted while clinging to the hole in the wall.
“What a guy,” the bearded man muttered in shock.
“Son of a bitch…,” the short man spat. His rifle was lying on top of the rubble. As he stuck out his face to spy, a bullet struck immediately. This time the bullet cut a line through his cheek, and crushed one brick of the building.
“Damn it!” The man hid himself.


While holding Flute, Kino removed the magazine with her left hand and inserted a new one.
Debris fell from the top of her hat when she shook her head lightly.


“I’ll go.”
Among the three men in front of the rubble, it was the bearded man who spoke. The other two looked at him.
From the hole in the wall, the short man wrapped the wound in his right arm with cloth using his left hand and mouth.
“I’ll go. I’ll take the rest of the explosives. At this point, there’s no reason for my comrades to get reduced any further. I’ll try to ‘persuade’ him.”
The bald man who was looking at the bearded man for some time asked, “Why does it have to be you?”
The bearded man spoke. “I am the oldest, see. You should respect your elders.”
“……. Fine…,” the bald man said, and took out a small shoulder bag from the rucksack. Inside were four box-shaped explosives. The other person took out from his waist pouch a tobacco-like object with a long cord. It was the fuse.
“It will take seven seconds after pulling the string.”
“I know.”
The bearded man took it, carefully inserted it in the explosives and stopped it with his hand.
The man pulled the pendant from his neck, and removed it.
“Take care of this,” he held it out to the bald man and then, “I’ll take it back later.”
“… Right.”
The bearded man dropped the pendant onto the outstretched hand, and held the hand tightly. Then he also held the hand of the other man.
The bearded man inserted the fuse in the explosive, and hung the shoulder bag around his neck. He turned it around so that it wouldn’t be visible from the front. The tip of the cord was concealed by his neck.
And then,
“We have something to say!” a thick and loud voice came out. “We have something to say!”
The bearded man lifted up both his hands, and slowly revealed himself from the rubble.
Upon seeing him, the face of the man in the wall changed color ——he instantly understood what he was trying to do.
The bearded man walked over the rubble. No bullets came.
Slowly, the man walked while checking his foothold. He passed in front of the hole in the wall.


“We have something to say!”
The wind carried the man’s voice to Kino’s ears clearly.
Kino looked once at the hole in the wall and moved her aim to the head of the man with upraised hands.
“We have something to say!”
When the bearded man had advanced halfway through, a voice replied, “Do not get any closer, please talk from there.”
It was a voice just loud enough for the man to hear.
“We have something to say! I don’t have a persuader! I’ll go there!” the man shouted as he continued to walk.
“I can hear you just fine, so please talk from there.”
He ignored the voice and kept walking.
“If you advance any further, I’ll shoot. Please stop.”
He heard the order when the remaining distance was only about one-third. The bearded man saw the opponent aiming at him. It was a young person wearing a hat and goggles.
The bearded man laughed once. And then,
“Uwaaaaaaaaa!” He ran as he roared. He grasped the bag in his back with his right hand, and held the cord with his left.
The first bullet hit his belly. The second bullet hit his right lung.
The man continued to rush forward. He pulled the cord with his left hand. The man’s right hand threw the bag using his right hand with full force.
It was the moment when he released it from his hand.
The third bullet hit the bag. In mid-air, the cloth made a ripping sound as a hole tore through it, and the bag’s forward force was extinguished.
After throwing, the man who rolled face down saw the bag fell down right in front of his eyes.
“! ——Uwaaah!” While screaming, the man rose to pick it up, and ran as he held it in his arms.


Kino did not fire a fourth bullet. She turned away from the field.
She avoided the edge of the crumbling street and began to run at full speed towards the center.


There was an explosion.
The blast broke through the length of the street. There was a violent tremor, and the buildings began to collapse.
The man in the wall jumped out as it was filled with dust. Soon the wall collapsed.
No one could be seen any more in the street, where the dust rolled up like thunderclouds.


The shock from the explosion shook Hermes a little.
“Oh—— Earthquake, it’s an earthquake,” Hermes muttered.
“‘The earthquake intensity just now is about one-half? —The shaking is especially greater in seaside areas, so be on alert for tsunamis. More details will be provided shortly in the news,’” he further said to himself.
“So boring…” he murmured.


The wind blew, and the dust was wiped off and disappeared from the rubble-filled street.
“Did we do it…?” the bald man said as he looked at the mountain of rubble that was now higher than before. At the same time, one part of a building collapsed.
He went looking for his comrades. On the left side, the rucksack-carrying man, and a little further on top of the rubble the short man, were lying. Dust and stone fell off both of the men as they stood up. Harsh coughing sounds were heard.
As the bald man helped his comrade up, he noticed something and picked it up.
“Did we do it?” the rucksack-carrying man asked.
“We don’t know yet,” the bald man answered and showed him what he was holding. It was a right boot, containing a torn leg.
“……”
The boot looked familiar.


“Gone. He’s gone.”
The short man was up front, with his rifle raised to his waist, proceeding atop the rubble. Behind him, the bald man aimed ahead with the rifle’s scope.
“That degree of explosion would blow off everything and wouldn’t leave any trace…,” the rucksack-carrying man said. A grenade was already inserted in his rifle.
“We can’t be careless.”
“Yeah.”
They passed through the center of the explosion. Stuff that appeared to be internal organs were stuck on the side of the wall. The men advanced further.
“I found it! That bastard’s blood!” the short man exclaimed. The bald man approached, looking carefully at his surroundings.
On the street rubble, there was a small pool of blood, from which traces of blood started. Blood drips the size of the tip of a thumb were scattered here and there, and continued ahead the street.
“We did it. He bled considerably,” the short man said.
“Depends on where he was hit… However, he is definitely injured,” the bald man said without changing expression.
“Let’s follow.”


The bloodstains extended towards the east.
Eventually, the crumbled buildings on both sides disappeared from view. Right in front was a not-so-high iron fence completely tumbled on its side. Beyond it was an expanse of land, and beside it was a large concrete building. It was a three-storey building with many glass windows.
“He escaped into the schoolhouse,” the short man said. The three men concealed themselves behind two abandoned cars on the road in front of the fence. The bloodstains were lying beyond the fence, straight through the schoolyard.
“An ambush, eh?” the rucksack-carrying man said.
“Grenade. Can we do it from this distance? How many left?” the bald man asked as he lowered his body, looking out front with the binoculars. The rucksack-carrying man answered.
“It’s possible. But barely, since we’re aiming from a low position. There are five shots left.”
“I’ll get him to come out. I’ll be the decoy. Even if he shoots my leg, don’t come out. Fire four grenades in a row towards that room. Got it?”
The two men nodded, and replied with the same word.
“Understood.”


“I’m very sorry…. However…,” Kino said. Both of her hands were dyed a deep red.


As usual, the sky was covered with unbroken clouds.
While the bald man was keeping his body low, he went across the schoolyard holding his rifle, one step at a time. There was nowhere to hide.
On both sides of the car, the two men were peeking through their scopes, their fingers ready in the triggers. They were suppressing their rough breathing, staring at the broken pieces of glass windows of the schoolhouse for a good thirty seconds.
A gunshot echoed.
It was from the schoolhouse. Four shots fired in succession were heard. And then the roaring sounds of bullets.
The bald man dropped down, and then shouted. “Second floor! Third classroom from the right!”
The two men reacted, aiming towards that direction. They saw a barrel from the broken glass of a window, from which the high-pitched gunshots were coming out. The bullets drifted far above the car.
Two grenades were launched at the same time.
They flew in a low trajectory, breaking through the glass and flying into the room. They exploded.
All the glass windows of the classroom shattered. The pieces of shattered glass fell into the balcony.
“Next!”
“Alright!”
The men fired two more grenades.
Both shots flew into the window frame, right where they aimed.
The man lying down in the school yard peeked through the scope as he listened to the explosions.
No moving figure could be seen inside the wrecked classroom. No one fired a shot. All of a sudden it became quiet, and the sound of the wind could be clearly heard.
“Did we do it?” the man murmured.


Dried bloodstains crossed the schoolyard, climbed up the staircase on the right side of the schoolhouse, and headed towards the second floor hallway.
The short man put out his head into the long and dark corridor. The bloodstains extended towards the third classroom. Even from the corridor, the blown off door dangling from its hinge was visible.
The men walked in the hallway, prepared to shoot at any moment. They came to the front of the door; while one person was poising his persuader, another kicked the door open.
They saw what’s inside. The grenade’s fragments pierced the ceiling, floor and inner walls. Several desks rolled over, their frames made of iron pipes bent.
“There’s nothing here…,” the short man said, slowly entering. Inside, there was nobody. There was no corpse.
The bald man entered while the rucksack-carrying man guarded the back.
“Hey. It’s that guy’s rifle. Seems like it’s still usable.”
The short man found the persuader trapped underneath a desk, and lightly poked it with his foot. Several fragments pierced the stock, but its scope and parts were safe under the desk.
As the short man tried to pick it up,
“Get it later. We have to see his corpse,” the bald man said.
The short man lifted up his crouching body, and did not notice the thin wire wrapped around Flute’s trigger.
“Hey.”
The rucksack-carrying man found bloodstains underneath the desk. It went through another door, going out to the hallway. Sticky dots were rubbed off the floor.
“What a tough guy,” the short man said with a grin. With him first, they went out to the hallway once again. There were footprints from the left foot, and on the right side, there was blood.
This did not surprise them, and continued searching the next two classrooms. They opened the first door, and saw that there were marks of it being closed. There were no traces of anyone leaving this room.
The two men poised their rifles; the short man crouched to the side of the door, slowly turning the knob.
Tmp—
He pushed the door. It opened with a creak.
While poising his rifle, the short man moved his gaze from the blood clots on the floor to the inside of the room. A red line crawled on the floor, extended to the center of the classroom, and ended underneath a desk.
On top of the table, there was a familiar face.
“……”
It was the face of the bearded man. His eyes were shut, as if he was sleeping. Behind it was the head, and underneath was the neck.
“……”
And there was a desk wet with blood. There was nothing else in the classroom.
“Ah… aah…”
These were the only sounds that leaked out from the short man’s mouth. His eyes were wide open as he stepped into the room. Shortly, the other two men also saw the traces. On top of the desk, they saw the freshly severed head.
“……”
The severed head was on top of the cloth where it was wrapped some time ago. The cloth was dyed deep red.
“It was not his blood…,” the rucksack-carrying man said.
“Ah… a-aah… That bastard… That bastard…” While moaning, the short man approached the desk.
“That bastard… What a thing to do… Damn it… How awful… That bastard… To desecrate the body of a dead man… That bastard… That bastard…”
*Clatter*
The rifle fell from the man’s hands. The short man, while crying, stretched out both his hands towards his comrade’s head.
“How horrible… This sort of thing…”
He touched the cheeks with both hands,
“I’ll take him on… I’ll take him on… Ah…”
And lifted his comrade (‘s head).
“Stop!” the bald man cried out. At the same time, a string tied to a hair on the back of the severed head got pulled. On it, a waterproof match was attached, the tip of which was placed between two stones. As well as a fuse.
A small green bottle hidden in the hair fell on top of the cloth. Small sparks from the fuse scattered from the bottle’s mouth. The short man looked at it.
“Eh?”
It exploded.


The schoolhouse shook with a thunderous roar. All the glass panes of the classroom were blown off.
The white smoke was blown towards the balcony.


From the side of the stairs on the north side, Kino walked as she saw the smoke disappear from the hallway. She headed to the destroyed classroom.
With her right hand stained deep red with another person’s blood, she pulled out Canon and entered the wrecked classroom from the blown off door.
Of the three men, one person lost his upper body. Those were splattered all over the wall.
Another person was wriggling against the wall, bleeding from a glass fragment piercing his face. His trembling hands held a grenade, and he was trying to pull out the safety pin from its tip.
The bald man lying face up beside the door stirred. He tried to draw out his hand persuader from the holster on his waist using his right hand.
Kino stood in front of the man holding the grenade, and fired a bullet to his chest. The man let out a cry, and stopped moving.
With his bloody right hand, the bald man pointed his hand persuader towards Kino. He attempted to pull the trigger.
“It will not fire, you know,” Kino said. The man’s right hand applied force (to the trigger).
“?”
And no bullet came out.
The persuader dropped from the man’s hand. The man looked at his right hand. His index and middle fingers had been torn off.
Kino stood beside the man.
“This young… it was a mere boy…,” the man said while looking quietly at Kino.
“Why me? If you don’t mind, can you tell me the reason?” Kino asked. The man took one deep breath, and spoke.
“What’s wrong with protecting our own country…?”
“Your own country…?” Kino asked in return.
The man reached out his right hand to his own breast and pulled out the chain of a pendant with his thumb. It was a small, round pendant with a star design.
He put it up in front of his face and looked at it.
“This place is our country…. That’s why we fight…”
“……”
The man started to mutter, not paying attention to anyone in particular.
“Aah… We couldn’t do anything. We couldn’t do anything and returned shamelessly…. We couldn’t become heroes. Everyone’s gone…. At the very least, until the end, we will try to become heroes… by protecting this country…. Ah, even so, it was no good. Until the very end, we couldn’t become heroes…”
Kino was listening.
The man spoke to Kino. “Come now, kill me quick. One shot… take me to where everybody is.”
“There’s no need for that. You will die soon,” Kino answered. She replied to the man whose left hand was blown off, exposing a big, bloody mass of flesh.
“Whatever,” the bald man said with a grin.
And he died smiling.


Kino gently closed the man’s eyes.
“‘——Even if our heroes do not come back, they will always be alive in our hearts——’”
Kino murmured. And then she closed her eyes.


“Welcome back, Kino. You are stained with so much blood, are you hurt anywhere?”
“No. Probably.”
“You killed them all?”
“Yup.”
“Then, everything’s fine now?”
“Yeah, everything’s fine. No one will shoot us without warning while we’re riding anymore.”
“Kino. The pouch on your left.”
“Hmm?”
“There’s a hole. Could it be that you were shot?”
“……. Ah, I didn’t notice at all…. When was it, I wonder? At the park, maybe?”
“Then, what about my souvenir?”
“Just this.”
“What’s this? It’s just a bullet.”
“It’s a bullet from the rifle those men used. Exactly like Flute’s. I got a lot of these bullets.”
“What was that about? Don’t you have any other souvenirs?”
“Ah. I have a story for you.”
“Eh? What kind?”

Written by the store manager

3094th day since grand opening (Sunny)
There were no customers again today.
The customer that came a long time ago left some seeds. The ‘pumpkin’ vegetables that came from the seeds have finally become edible. I tried cutting it up and boiling it while being careful of the thick rind that the customer warned me about.
It tasted sweet and was pretty good. I should try to grow more of them. They seem like they would be good fried as well.

3095th day since grand opening (Sunny, then cloudy)
There were no customers again today.
Without doing anything in particular, I read a book and tended to the store.
I finished reading “The Melancholy of Ulericks”[2].
It was funny.

3096th day since grand opening (Rainy)
There were no customers again today.
The weather was bad all day. I couldn’t do the laundry.
The pumpkin in the pot went bad. It spoils fast.

3097th day since grand opening (Sunny)
There were no customers again today.
The weather cleared up and it was a good day.
I hung the laundry out to dry. I accidentally dropped a shirt and it got covered in mud. Now I’ll have to wash it again.
I thought about putting concrete just under the drying area but I stopped in consideration of the moles and earthworms.

3098th day since grand opening (Sunny)
There were no customers again today.
I did the product inspection as usual. Everything was without problems. Whenever someone does buy something, it’ll work properly. I feel a bit happier.
Afterwards, I resumed reading.

3099th day since grand opening (Cloudy, then sunny)
There were no customers again today.
In the afternoon I hung the ‘Ring bell for service’ sign and went fishing by the river out back.
I caught five fish, some large and some small. I let the small ones go.
For dinner I had meunière for the first time in ages.

3100th day since grand opening (Cloudy)
There were no customers again today.
Something’s been wrong with the power generator since this morning. I fixed it.
I cleaned the store as usual. I always strive for a tidy interior.
I was thinking about smoking the remaining fish, but didn’t since there was only a little left. I ate it for dinner.

3101st day since grand opening (Cloudy)
There were no customers again today.
I did the periodic inspection of my measuring equipment. It had a slight tendency toward lower measurements, but all were within the acceptable margin of error. I’ll re-examine them in another 40 days.
I unpacked one cut of meat from the freezer.

3102nd day since grand opening (Sunny)
A customer came today. It’s the first time in 79 days. For the first time in a long time, I’ll have a long journal entry.
The weather was very good since the morning.
With high spirits, I hung out the sheets to dry and opened the store.
Now that I think about it, I had a feeling that maybe someone would come today, or something like that.


Since I had that feeling, I thought I might have something like a sixth sense. I thought I might try to measure it this time.
When the customer came, it was shortly before noon.
Just as I was wondering what to have for lunch, I heard the sound of an engine coming closer so I hurried outside.
The customer was a young traveler on a motorrad who happened to be passing by the store when I called out to stop them in a loud voice and, showing interest, they stopped.
I thought it was rare to travel using a motorrad. At that time, I was thinking how easier it was to fly using a bike, but now that I think about it again, an amateur wouldn’t be able to do anything if the lifter overheats even once, and so using a motorrad to run through the surface would be more reliable after all. [3]
The traveler introduced herself as Kino.
Miss Kino wore a white shirt under a black vest.
I have an interest in clothing so I asked about hers. Her vest was a jacket with removable sleeves that she said she removed when it was hot or put on when it was cold.
‘I see,’ I thought, impressed. On a journey, one has to keep his belongings to a minimum.


After a moment, I ushered Miss Kino and Hermes, the motorrad into the store.
Miss Kino took a seat and I served her some tea.
As expected of a traveler, she was careful to inquire as to the contents of the tea before drinking any.
I drank some first to prove its safety.
Miss Kino apologized for being impolite, but I told her not to worry about it. I’ve often heard rumors of robbers who put coma-inducing drugs into tea, so I think it’s good to be careful.
“I humbly welcome you to my store,” I thanked them sincerely.
Then I asked them if I could start explaining about my main products.
“Before that, would you mind me asking a few questions about your store?” Miss Kino said. I was pleased to see that she had an interest in my store. I told her that she could ask whatever she liked.
“Then I’ll get straight to it. Why would you have a store like this here?”
“Right! Right in the middle of this big prairie. I was surprised to see a lone shop on the horizon.”
Miss Kino and Mr. Hermes, the motorrad, asked.
I thought it was a very natural question. Around this store, there was nothing but grasslands, forests, rivers, and lakes. It depends on the vehicle, but the distance to the nearest country is several days’ travel.
“And are you, the manager, the only one who works here? There’s no one else?” Mr. Hermes asked further.
I honestly answered their questions, one at a time. The reason why I set up a shop here was because I liked the location. Considering that I would be living in the store, it seemed obvious that I should choose a nice location. This place was very nice. However, I didn’t tell them that the blockheads from my homeland forbade me from setting up shop, and that I didn’t have any country I could go to.
Then I piled up my valuables and necessary equipment onto a truck and arrived here. From there, I built the store and house and set up my own shop. I also told her that I had no family and that though my parents are back in my homeland, I don’t know how they are doing now.
I have no idea whether Miss Kino or Mr. Hermes understood what I said.
“Do customers come?” Miss Kino asked.
“Yes. On average, there’s one every hundred days or so. Of course, all of them were either travelers or traders. Everyone stopped by out of curiosity.”
I did not lie.
“Then, have you sold anything until now?” Mr. Hermes asked.
“Nope. I am yet to sell a single thing.”
I did not lie.
There are two opinions regarding lying to customers just to be able to sell something; one is that it’s excusable, and another is that it shouldn’t be done. But in my opinion, there’s no pride in lying to myself, so I have never lied about this. Not now, and not in the future.


“This is the pride of my store.”
I said, and among my wares, I held the tiniest ‘Model no. 5’ in front of Miss Kino and Mr. Hermes.
I decided to have them take a look at it first. I placed it on top of the table so that they could examine it freely. I let the customers freely touch and investigate the items because I want them to think that my store is a good one. That is what I’m always aiming for.
In my homeland, the tools dealer in the eastern district was a horrible person.
He wouldn’t allow the tools in his shop to be touched, so the customers don’t have any idea about the quality of the products. His wares were lined up neatly in a row behind glass shelves, and the shop assistant will tell you with a cool face that they can only be taken out when you have decided to buy them.
I remember well how I left that store with so much resentment.
Around the time when I decided to set up my own shop, I was thinking of how I don’t want my shop to be like that. Even though it was a long time ago, I still remember it now.
I realized that I don’t want Miss Kino to feel the same disgust I felt that time, and I am somewhat glad that I became a person who can learn from bad examples.


“What is this?” Miss Kino asked after taking a brief look at it.
“Couldn’t you tell from a glance?” I said a bit jokingly (Of course, in a manner that wouldn’t be rude to the customer). I find it enjoyable to explain to my customers about the pride of my store, a product that I myself made.
“It’s a navy blue improvised suitcase. It doesn’t have buckles, but it has a switch,” Mr. Hermes who was looking from afar, answered.
“That’s right. It does appear to be a suitcase. I made it look that way. But it’s actually different. The truth is——”
I was slightly irritated. But if I express my irritation, the customer would be angry and leave. Even so I’m slightly irritated.
“It’s a high-power bomb,” I said.
Just as I thought, both Miss Kino and Mr. Hermes were surprised and looked dumbfounded. (Well, Mr. Hermes’ appearance doesn’t change, but I think he was surprised too.)
‘Products that appear very different from their function attract the interest of customers more. Dedicate yourself to ‘catchy’ products.’
That was written in a book.
“A high-power bomb, you say? Am I right in thinking that inside this thing, there’s some explosive material and some sort of iron shrapnel for wounding and killing people?” Miss Kino asked.
“Yes. My store sells high-power bombs. Nothing else. This is a specialty store for high-power bombs. Also, the high-power bombs that I make are completely different from normal bombs. Its power is incomparable to that of existing explosives. In just one snot…”
It has been a long time since I last made a sales talk, and I couldn’t speak without stuttering. I was very nervous since it was really long ago since I last spoke with a customer. Even though I practiced for it. I was embarrassed.
“S-sorry. ——In just one shot, this bomb can blow up completely a country, no matter how big it is. The explosion will produce tremendous temperatures and shockwaves that can melt, blow away, and burn everything above ground, including humans. At the same time, it spreads a powerful toxic chemical that can make ill any human who did not die instantly from the explosion. They will eventually die, suffering bit by bit.”
“What kind of principle did you use?” Mr. Hermes asked.
“The same as the one used for the sun. It utilizes nuclear fusion,” I replied with an answer prepared beforehand.
Only Mr. Hermes understood me at this point, and so I tried to explain simply to Miss Kino. After my explanation, I did not know whether Miss Kino completely understood its structure.
However, Miss Kino immediately remembered the more popular name for my product.
“You’re saying that you made this ‘hydrogen bomb’ that can blow up a country in a blink of an eye?”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“On your own?”
“Yes.”
I answered Miss Kino and Mr. Hermes’ questions promptly like an excellent shop assistant. I decided to explain a bit more about my product.
“In my homeland, I came up with and tried to make a bomb according to that principle. The development was a success. However, it’s regrettable, because in my country, not a single person wanted something like it. That’s when I decided to set up my store outside the country to sell them. Today is the 3102nd day since I opened shop.”
“Haven’t you ever thought of trying this before?” Miss Kino asked.
“I haven’t. There’s no country I wish to destroy, or a person I wish to kill. I’m very satisfied just to know that I can make something I thought about and wanted to make. I think it’s very natural for a person who wanted to make something to make it, and a person who wanted to use something to use it. If a person who wanted it were to buy it and use it, the person who made it will be very satisfied,” I answered. That’s how I answer whenever and whoever someone asks.
I decided to talk about the crucial point.
“Miss Kino, Mr. Hermes, would you like to buy the hydrogen bomb I created? Someday, somewhere, it might become useful to you. For instance, you can place it in a country you don’t like to blow it to bits, or you can create a new lake in the middle of nature.”
‘Use the most straightforward sales talk possible. If you have confidence in your product (if there’s none, that’s a problem), stick out your chest and offer it.’
That was written in a book.
“Right now we’re on a special sale, so if you buy one, I’ll give you one more for free. It is exactly the same bomb, with power no less than the first. Both will include a fuse that can be used between three seconds to a hundred days. In addition to that, I also provide service to have its exterior repainted to a color you like, or maybe have your name engraved on it.”
‘Moreover, it’s good to give the product a ‘push’ by giving a value-added offer.’
That was also written.
“I have utmost confidence in my product, but I still offer periodic inspection of its functions. Misfire is impossible, nevertheless, in the case it fails on the second shot, or if you were not pleased by the strength of the explosion, I can give you a product replacement.”
‘Put the customer at ease by giving a warranty.’
This was also written.
Miss Kino looked as if she was pondering over something.
“By the way, how much does it cost?” Mr. Hermes asked. Of course, it’s an expected question.
“It depends on how much the customer is willing to pay. I also don’t mind trading with something of value,” I answered the usual thing.
Miss Kino still looked like she was thinking hard about something. As to what she thinks, of course, I had no idea.
After a while, Miss Kino shook her head.
“Too bad, but right now, we have no need for a ‘hydrogen bomb’. And so, we can’t buy it.”
Of course, I was disappointed upon hearing it.
Though it would be best if someone who wanted the bomb actually bought it, it’s very natural for a person who was not interested to not buy it.
Afterwards, Miss Kino proposed to buy or trade for some food. Then, I told her that if that’s going to be the case, I would like her to receive it without cost, as a favor.
I presented Miss Kino some vegetables and homemade beef jerky, boiled and put in airtight packs, as well as water. There are still more in my storehouse, and offered to fetch some for a while, and Miss Kino gladly expressed her thanks.
“It’s fine. This is ‘service’ for a customer,” I said. “If ever you find a need for a hydrogen bomb, you are welcome to come back anytime,” I added.
And then, I talked to Miss Kino about the road and the nearby country.
And then, since it was about time for lunch, I offered to share with her the thawed meat that I have for grilling. It has been a long time since I last had a meal with somebody.
After the meal, Miss Kino expressed her gratitude once more for the food, and rode to the west aboard Mr. Hermes.


After Miss Kino and Mr. Hermes went home, I cleaned the shop and tried changing the arrangement of my goods.
I thought about placing one item as decoration above the shelf. The item would be noticeable immediately upon entry into the shop.
If so, the shelf has to be strong. I’ll do that tomorrow.


It has been a long time since I last wrote a journal this long. My hands are completely tired from typing.
This day is very complete. It’s regrettable that I wasn’t able to sell my products, but there’s nothing I can do about the circumstances of my customers. However, I am really happy that a customer came.
I just hope that the next customer that will come will buy something.
Oh yes. I tried boiling the rest of the meat for dinner. It was delicious.

3103rd day since grand opening (Sunny)
There were no customers again today.
Up to now, there haven’t been any cases of customers coming two days in a row, and I don’t think there would be any in the future.
And so, of course, I can’t close the shop.
I reinforced the shelf, and decorated it with my ‘Model no. 3’, which was painted with my favorite color, blue.
As I thought, it might be more attractive if I put the items on the shelf. I’ll go with this for a while.


At lunch, I stir-fried some vegetables and meat, and I ate what was left in the evening.















"
26,v3c10,3,10,"The scenery in and out of the walls was the same.
It was a rough terrain spanned by brown mountains, without a single blade of grass growing on it. Only the endless stretch of high walls seemed to have sprouted from the ground, both of its sides sporting unchanging scenery.
Underneath the clear, almost transparent sky was a single road. It was a simple road made from hardened earth that was freed from stones. It weaved its way through the valley.
On this road ran a lone motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly). It rode with the morning sun behind it, its rear wheels raising a brown cloud of dust as it went on.
Instead of a back seat, the motorrad was fitted with a carrier, tied on top of which was a bag and a sleeping bag among other things. Two more black boxes were attached on either side of its rear wheel.
The rider wore a brimmed hat with ear flaps and a worn pair of silver-framed goggles. A bandana for protection against the cold was wrapped around her face. She wore a brown coat, the excess hem of which was rolled up to her thighs.
“Kino, this is such a dreary place. Both the atmosphere and the scenery,” the motorrad said as it ran.
“I guess so. There’s nothing here at all,” the rider called Kino answered.
“This doesn’t look anything like a country’s interior…. Have we really entered the country?”
“We have. The inspection booth was unmanned, though.”
“I wonder what sort of country this is? Maybe the citizens abandoned civilized living and decided to live in obscurity inside caves? That sounds interesting, if that’s the case.”
“But you know, Hermes, I heard that this country is so advanced that the people could stay inside buildings their whole lives. And also, that it was a very clean and beautiful country…,” Kino said.
“That’s definitely a lie,” the motorrad called Hermes replied confidently.
“That can’t be. That person said he left the country because it was too clean…. It’s just that I didn’t hear anything about those unmanned walls. I was only told that right in the middle of the wilderness, there should be a tall building and a dome visible along with the walls.
“And where is it?”
“Who knows?”
Kino dropped her speed when approaching a curve, and accelerated when the path went straight. After passing through the side of one mountain, another mountain appeared in its shadow.
“Maybe we’re lost?” Hermes asked out of boredom.
“Nope, that can’t be,” Kino denied.
After arguing back and forth for a while, they both fell silent. They only continued to run indifferently amidst the unchanging scenery.
It was about noon when the walls they were aiming for suddenly came in sight. It was when Kino and Hermes came out from the shadow of a vast mountain.


“See, I told you.”
“I see. So it wasn’t a lie after all.”
At the very heart of the wilderness, a tall building and a dome could be seen along with the walls.
From outside, the walls made of old stone looked as if it was coated with something that reflected light. Three enormous buildings stood out well above the walls, surrounded with a group of smaller buildings. The buildings were connected to each other with passages suspended in the air. Below them was a glass dome covering the entire country. The country looked like a huge fort.
At the gates, there were several uniformed officers and soldiers waiting for Kino and Hermes. They greeted Kino and Hermes with a smile.
Kino informed them of her wish to stay inside the country for three days. In response, they gave her a warm welcome, and told her that the country will bear all the expenses during her stay on one condition: that Kino, Hermes, and everything they brought with them will undergo a thorough cleaning. When Kino asked how it will be done,
“You will have to take a shower, Miss Kino. Meanwhile, your clothes will be washed. Also, Mr. Hermes will be sent to the car wash, while all of your belongings, from that big bag to the tiniest needle you have, will be cleaned and disinfected. Of course, you’ll have to list down all of your belongings and we will return them all to you afterwards.”
Kino contemplated for a while before accepting. Hermes voiced out his reluctance, but gave up since there was nothing they could do about it.
A while passed.
After undergoing various procedures, Kino and Hermes finally passed through the walls.
Kino was clad in her black jacket, fastened with a wide belt on the waist. On her right thigh and behind her waist were holsters containing hand persuaders (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol). There was not a speck of dust on her jacket, holsters, and the persuaders inside them.
The coat, which used to be covered in dust, was draped on top of the bag on the carrier, as good as new.
Not only was Hermes washed with water and disinfectant, all of his parts were also polished, and glittered like a mirror.
Kino muttered in front of a huge mirror.
“We have never been this clean before in our lives…”
“Say, what if we don’t leave this place? I don’t want to get dusty every day anymore,” Hermes said as the last door opened.


“This is the city. The majority of our population lives here.”
The guide waiting for Kino and Hermes beside the door explained as they entered.
Inside the walls of the so-called city was a clean and orderly space. The well-maintained roads ran through paved city blocks, with buildings lined up along them. Just above the roughly forty-storey buildings was the glass dome covering the entire country.
“With that dome, harmful light rays are intercepted. The window panes of the buildings do the same. The light and air inside the country are all regulated, and the temperature and humidity are adjusted according to the time and place. It’s not cold, isn’t it?”
“That’s true.” Kino opened the collar of her jacket.
“Oh, yes. Please attach this to Mr. Hermes,” the guide said, and showed them two box-shaped objects the size of a dictionary. Kino asked what they were.
“It’s probably a device that can purify exhaust gas. And the other must be a muffler. I thought they would definitely give us something like this,” Hermes answered, and Kino gave an impressed look. The guide skillfully attached the muffler to Hermes. 
“With this, it will be all right even if you run using your engine. There are even places inside buildings were cars are allowed to run. There are elevators inside the buildings, so please ride those. And also, here’s a map. This is all you need to give back once you leave the city.”
“Understood.”
Kino looked at the small gadget handed to her. A manual and their present location appeared on the screen.
The guide continued. “I believe you’ve seen the walls beyond this place. That was built around ten years ago after we expanded our territory. The original country came to be called the ‘city’, while the new territory became known as the ‘countryside’[2].”
“A territory? You mean there are people who live in that wasteland?” Hermes asked.
“Yes, there are. However, there’s really very few of them. Several groups of people live in villages scattered all over the place. These people are called ‘pioneers’. They volunteered to live in groups, and work to reclaim the wasteland.”
“Even though they could live inside this place?” Kino asked. The guide gave her a faint smile.
“That’s exactly why. Just as you’ve seen, everyone in our country is guaranteed a clean and comfortable place to live in. But as a result, many people longed for life alongside nature, above genuine soil and under the real sun.”
“I see.”
“The pioneers consist of family units. Among many volunteer families, only a handful who successfully passed health inspections and proficiency exams were chosen. After training, they set off to build the new country. It’s a real honor. Our special military forces who likewise went through a special screening served as their escort. After the reclamation, the land will be used as farmlands for self-sufficient villages. It will take a long time, but they are planning to make it into something different from the city. It was also an experiment to test whether our people, who have become delicate due to our way of life, could endure life amidst harsh nature.”
“Uh-huh.”
“And that’s why the pioneers are the ‘elite among the elite’ of our country. To tell you the truth, I also dreamed of living in the countryside to help in building the new country. But it’s impossible for normal people like me. I’ll probably faint if I see a wild lizard or a caterpillar; I wouldn’t be able to work at all!”
The guide smiled. “Yes. And I’m sure travelers like you will receive glances of admiration from everyone. You will get meal invitations left and right. You’d better expect them.  It’s up to you whether you accept someone’s invitation based on how they look or the kind of food they offer you,” the guide said happily.
“The type and the quantity of food. At least for Kino,” Hermes added.


Kino rode Hermes after parting with the guide before the gates.
Anywhere you look, the town was free from dirt and cracks.
Before Kino and Hermes arrived at the hotel, they received twelve invitations to dine. They turned them all down at the meantime.
The hotel was a single, high-rise building. They were guided, and rode a glass elevator. They were treated to a breathtaking view of the wilderness while they made their way to the room in the highest floor.
“It’s too roomy…. What do they use it for?” Kino muttered after the hotel boy left.
“It’s perfect. You can do your shooting practice here,” Hermes said.
Kino soon began to take down the luggage from Hermes, when the doorbell rang. A middle-aged man wearing a suit, and a woman who looked like his wife, appeared from a big monitor on the wall.
The man spoke. [Good day, miss traveler. I am this hotel’s owner. I called with my wife because we would like to request something from you. Will you spare us some of your time?]
Kino showed the couple inside. Still confused, Kino offered them a nearby table and chair. The two thanked her and sat down.
After introductions,
“Have you committed yourself to have lunch with someone tomorrow?” the owner asked. Both of them had serious expressions on their faces.
“No,” Kino answered. Upon hearing this, the two entreated her to accept their invitation, saying that they would do anything for her in return.
Kino asked them why they were willing to go to such lengths.
“We have a daughter who has been ill for a long time. We would like you to tell her stories about your travels,” the wife answered.


The next morning.
As always, Kino woke up at dawn.
She performed her light exercises, then proceeded with her persuader training. She called the revolver on her right thigh ‘Canon’, and the slim automatic behind her waist, ‘Woodsman’. She practiced quick draw with both, then disassembled and cleaned them. Afterwards, she took a shower in the spacious bathroom.
When the sun has risen, Kino ordered breakfast to be sent to her room. Perhaps due to the owner’s orders, a splendid meal in large quantities came.
After her meal, Kino bitterly saw off what remained of the food.
“Cheapskate. You’ll get to eat lunch after, too!” Hermes, who woke up unnoticed, said from behind.


Kino straddled the luggage-free Hermes, and rode through the city.
Hermes was all praises for the roads and the buildings’ structures.
“Hmm. Is that so?” It couldn’t be discerned from Kino’s reply whether she agreed or not.
Even during their sightseeing, they received invitations everywhere. Kino declined on the merit of their previous engagement, and continued.
When it was almost noontime, Kino arrived at the place the owner indicated in the map the previous day. It was a big, white building built in a place a bit far from the center of the country. The buildings around it were reduced on purpose, to create an unrestricted atmosphere. A signboard told them that it was the ‘First National Hospital’.
The couple welcomed them when they came in. As they thanked her again, Kino removed her hat. Then they were guided to the room where the couple’s daughter ‘resided’.


The room was lined up with wooden furniture that gives off an air of history and refinement. The ambience of the room was like that of an old mansion.
A young girl in her early teens was sitting on a large bed with lace curtains draping from the pillars and the roof.
Her skin was white. Almost everyone in this country had fair skin, but this girl’s skin was even paler, pure white like that of bleached paper. She had long, blond hair that hung down to the bed, and blue eyes in her thin face.
She wore a thin, pink cardigan on top of pajamas patterned with blue and red tomatoes.
The girl was reading a letter she held with both hands. She read it with narrowed eyes.
When she heard the knock on the door, the girl carefully folded the letter and put it inside an envelope. Then she opened a box on her bedside and placed it inside.
“Please come in.” The door automatically opened in response to the girl’s voice.


“I am Kino. This here is my partner, Hermes.”
Kino introduced.
“I’m Inertia. It’s nice to meet you, Miss Kino, Mr. Hermes. I heard about you from my mother. Thank you for coming all the way to my room.”
The girl stood up, lightly picked up the hem of an imaginary dress, and curtsied.
“Thank you for your courtesy,” Kino placed her hand on her chest and bowed. Kino wore her white shirt. Her persuaders and their holsters were tucked neatly in her jacket and tied on Hermes’ carrier.
Kino propped Hermes on his center stand in front of the bed, and seated herself.
“Please don’t hold back. You see, Kino was promised a grand meal and new ammunition, while I will be given high quality oil, plugs, and fuel. It’s give-and-take,” Hermes said.
Inertia laughed. “I was surprised. When I heard about a traveler riding a motorrad, I was… expecting someone who looked wild and older.”
“If what you mean by ‘wild’ is someone rough-mannered, then you got the right person,” Hermes said, and Kino gave a twitchy smile.
Inertia looked at Kino with her azure eyes. “Will you tell me stories about your travels?”
“Sure. I came here for that reason,” Kino said.


Lunch was carried into the room, and Kino dined together with Inertia and the couple.
Kino and Hermes told them stories about their travels. Not only Inertia, but even her parents listened with deep interest.
After the meal. The parents left the hospital room regretfully, saying that they had to return to work.
Only Kino, Hermes, and the owner of the room were left.
Kino and Inertia sat with the table between them, and Hermes on the left side. There was a platter of fruits, tea cups and a teapot on the table.
“Thank you very much for sparing some of your time for me. I had so much fun. I’m sure everybody in the country would have wanted to listen to your stories, since it was a long time since a traveler ever came here…,” Inertia said.
Kino shook her head. “Don’t worry about it. It was just as Hermes said.”
“But other people might have been more generous…,” Inertia said, looking troubled.
“Or not. Right now, we may be saying to ourselves, ‘It would’ve have been better if we accepted that other invitation…’”
“That’s true. Besides, you’re sick for two years now. You wouldn’t be punished for having a little fun, right?”
Kino and Hermes quickly said, and the girl slowly smiled.
“Do you know about my illness?” Inertia asked, still smiling.
Kino answered, “We heard from your father. Since a long time ago, a certain proportion of the population, regardless of age, would get this mysterious illness. A cure or vaccine has yet to be found. But only recently, they developed a drug that could delay the progress of the disease. It seems like it won’t take a long time before they finally find a cure.”
“That’s right. ——Soon, that medicine will be completed, and I will take it. Then, I can finally go home to our house and go to school again.”
“Yup.”
“That’s right.”
“Maybe everyone from my old school still remembers me… or maybe they have forgotten about me already. They might get surprised when they see me. Maybe I can play with everyone again soon. But I don’t really care about playing. I will study and train hard to be able to go to the countryside someday.
“Oh? You want to go out there?” Hermes asked. Inertia smiled and nodded.
“Your parents don’t know about that, do they?” Kino said. Inertia was slightly surprised.
“Yes. … So you realized it.”
“It’s because you didn’t show that attitude before while we were telling you stories. If anything, it’s your parents who looked as if they’re ready to abandon their jobs to go out there.”
“Ahahaha. That may be true. My father and my mother also longed to live in the countryside after all. But since there’s the hotel, it’s not possible. I couldn’t even imagine what they would say if I told them that I wanted to go.”
“You want to do farm work?” Kino asked.
“There’s that… but more importantly, there’s someone I would like to meet. I wanted to thank that person once we see each other.”
“But… your parents don’t know about that person, right?” Hermes said.
“No…,” Inertia answered with a small voice.
“What kind of person? Eh?” Hermes asked immediately.
“Um… please keep it a secret from my parents, okay? No, please don’t tell anyone!” Inertia boldly declared, shaking her blond head. Her white cheeks were stained red ever so slightly.
“Okay. This will not escape this room.”
“Understood.”
Kino and Hermes agreed. Inertia’s face quickly lit up.
Inertia stood up and headed to the bed. She opened the box on her bedside and took out a book the size of a dictionary. It was a diary. It was carefully bound, and locked with a key.
She opened the diary with the key. There were several letters placed in between the pages.
“I keep in touch with someone in the countryside. These are all the letters I received from that person.”
“A boy? Or a girl?” Hermes asked.
“It’s… a boy,” Inertia answered clearly. And continued, “His name is Logue. He’s the same age as me. Right now, he lives in a pioneer village together with his family.”
“A friend from your school? I heard that only a few were selected as pioneers,” Kino asked. Inertia shook her head.
“We met purely by chance. One year ago, he went to the hospital for the medical examination of the volunteers. I was looking at the countryside from the observation deck, when he suddenly jumped up, pointed at the countryside, and shouted, ‘I see it! I’ll definitely go there!’”
“Uh-huh.”
“He was not supposed to be in there. And while I looked at him in surprise, the nurses came to take him away…. Then I quickly told them, ‘That person is my friend.’”
“Way to go!” Hermes praised. Inertia returned a coy look.
“He thanked me, and then we gazed at the scenery together for a long time. He told me that living in the countryside was his ultimate dream. He talked about it passionately. Back then we promised each other that he would pass the exams and live there, and that I would do my best to get well from my illness.”
“And then you started writing letters to each other.”
“Yes. So that it wouldn’t be too much trouble for us both, we decided to send only one page each month. In his second letter, he wrote that he and his family were able to pass the assessment, and that they would soon start living in the newly-built village! I was really happy for him. He told me that if we tried hard enough, our dreams will really come true…,” The girl spoke, her blue eyes sparkling. “Soon after, he moved to the countryside with his family. After a while, a letter came saying, ‘This place was more amazing than I thought. I’ll try my best!’ We continued to exchange letters every month. In his letter three months ago, he told me that the first child has been born in the village. In the one two months ago, he said that he was completely fine even though an insect landed on his food. And in his latest letter, he told me that fifty tomato seedlings have grown in their greenhouse, and that he was having fun helping with the work every day. ——He’s doing his best to make his dreams come true. And so, I have to do my best to fight my illness too. I feel bad for a while after I drink my medicine. But when that happens, I read his letters. They fill me with courage. Humans are weak alone, but I believe that when they encourage each other, they can do anything!” Inertia spoke ecstatically.
“That’s right! Kino, you should go find yourself a boyfriend too!” Hermes teased.
“Mind your own business,” Kino said.
After Inertia and Kino’s laughter subsided,
“When I get better, I will take the qualification exam and permission to go the country. I want to try living in that village and eat tomato grown from real soil. It’s my dream.”
“I hope they complete that medicine soon,”
“Yeah,”
Kino and Hermes said.
“Yes. I’m sure everything will be all right. I believe the future will head to a good direction if we work hard. I’m sure it will be all right. I’m sure of it,” the white-skinned girl said.


“Miss Kino, Mr. Hermes, I have one request.”
The winter sun was beginning to set, and the light penetrating the glass dome was automatically regulated.
“When I met you, I thought I could make this request. It’s rather selfish of me, but I thought I had to do it no matter what.” Inertia bit her lip. 
“What is it? Since you have treated us this much, I, being a nice guy, would do anything for you. Besides, I’m a wonderful motorrad so I can help you,” Hermes said.
Kino hit Hermes tank first, before asking Inertia what her request was.
“You will head west to depart the country, right? It seems that the village Logue lives in is a bit south from that road…”
“I see,” Kino said. Inertia looked straight at Kino.
“We can only exchange letters because of the rules. But actually, there was a present I had wanted to give to him before he left for the country”
Inertia took out a small box from inside the box on her bedside. She opened it and took out the object inside.
It was a tiny brooch carved out from something white. It was a little rough, but it can be recognized as a bird from its form. Short, golden hair was glued on its wings and cockscomb.
“You made this yourself?” Kino asked.
“Yes… I made it as small as possible, but it won’t fit inside the envelope no matter what I do. My request is to send this to Logue. It’s a charm to make the farm do well, and so that he would not get sick or injured. I would like you to give this to the post office where I always send my letters. I know this is selfish of me. But, I don’t think I will ever have a chance like this again. Please…”
Kino gazed at the brooch for a while.
“I have no reason to reject your request.”
“You bet. There would be now way for us to grant your wish if you asked us to deliver a bed or something.”
Kino and Hermes said.


Inertia was almost in tears as she thanked Kino and Hermes. Right then, the nurse came in and looked at Kino and Hermes in surprise.
After giving Inertia her medicine, the nurse asked if Kino and Hermes were to depart the next day.
“Then please have lunch at our house!” she said, almost clinging to Kino.
Kino shook her head. “Too bad, but I’m planning to look around the countryside tomorrow. I would like to observe the village growing tomatoes.”


The next day, that is, the morning of the third day since Kino entered the country.
Kino woke up at dawn.
Outside the window was the expanse of the cloudless, light-purple sky, and the wilderness devoid of grass.
The ammunition, portable rations, and all of the things she requested were arranged in the elevator in her room. Her clothes were washed, and a few of them were new. Hermes was given his plugs and fuel, and his oil was replaced the previous night.
As usual, Kino performed her light exercises and her persuader training. Afterwards, she took a long shower and ate her breakfast slowly, as if she was reluctant to part with them.
They checked out of the hotel as soon as the sun has risen. The couple came and couldn’t thank them enough for making Inertia happy.
After leaving the hotel, they rode through the city, which was free from pedestrians.
Upon arriving at the city’s western gates, Kino returned the map and made her preparations to depart. Kino checked her persuaders and wore her coat. She also returned the exhaust purification device, thinking that it wouldn’t last long.
Because it would take them a long time to go back to the city, she made sure that she didn’t leave anything behind. Kino confirmed that the small box was inside her jacket’s pocket.
They headed for the walls and went out. The cold wind was blowing, and the dust danced about.
Kino asked the soldier for directions, and was shown a map of the country. Kino and Hermes looked at it intently for a while, and set off.


A lone motorrad was running through the wilderness.
“Do you get it?” Hermes asked, and Kino answered.
“Of course. It’s not indicated in the map, but the geographic features are there. After a distance of sixty, we should see two mountains to our left. After passing through that, we should see the 42nd pioneer village in the mountain basin. The road was drawn up to that place.”
“Why was the village not drawn in the map?”
“Maybe because it’s still new? We’ll find out once we get there,” Kino said. 
“I suppose so,” Hermes said. And then, “I wonder what kind of face Logue would make once he gets Inertia’s present for him?”
“No idea… We’ll also know that once we get there.”
“I guess so.”
Kino accelerated some more. Kino and Hermes rode with the morning sun behind them.
On their way, they saw an enormous, green circle at the side of the road. It was a field from one of the pioneer villages, with a huge sprinkler making its rounds in it.
Around the time when the sun has ascended higher, and their shadows had grown shorter,
“Over here.”
Kino stopped Hermes.  There was a road climbing towards the two mountains to their left.
“It’s not such a nice road. It seems like my frame would get scratched with the flying stones.”
“Why are you complaining after we’ve come so far?”
Kino let the rear wheel slide ostentatiously, and turned Hermes to the left.
After climbing the mountain in one go,
“You’re a nice person aren’t you, Kino?”
“It’s just gratitude for the stuff they gave us.”
“Really?”
They rode through the flat summit for a while.
When the road has become a downward slope, a view opened before them.
“It must be that.”
“No doubt.”
In one corner of the wide basin were several buildings. Around it, the cultivated fields were spread in a checkered pattern. There was a plastic greenhouse reflecting the light.


“Strange…” Kino muttered.
Kino was in front of a building, looking at its door.
Hermes asked from the road. “There’s no one here after all?”
“There’s nobody. But it’s locked. With chains, too.”
They realized from afar that there was nobody in the fields, and even after approaching the village, no one came out. A cold wind blew through the road.
“It doesn’t look like the interior of the buildings were destroyed. It seems like their crops were also neatly harvested…,” Kino said.
“Maybe the villagers all moved to some other place? Perhaps this place was no good.”
“It would be troublesome if that’s the case…. We have to look for the new address to hand it over——”
“Kino, there’s a car,” Hermes called out to Kino. Kino returned to the road, and saw headlights approaching from the other side of the basin.
The car proceeded straight towards Kino and Hermes’ direction. It was a small four-wheel drive painted with the same color as the ground. There was only one person aboard it.
“Perfect. Let’s go ask.”
Kino waved to the car. The car stopped and the man inside it came out.
The man looked around his early twenties. He wore sunglasses that reflected Kino and Hermes, and was clad in the same green winter uniform that the soldiers outside the city gates wore.  There was a persuader holster attached on the left side of his waist belt, and a dagger was positioned behind him so that it could be pulled out with an underhand from the right.
“What are you doing in a place like this? Ah… could it be that you were the travelers who arrived the day before yesterday?” the man asked.
“That’s right. I’m Kino. This here is Hermes.”
“Hello.”
“Good day. Welcome to our country. I am Lieutenant Cole of the 3rd Special Security Squad,” the young officer joined his heels together and saluted.
“But why are you here?  If you wish to depart from the new western gate, you must have lost your way. It’s not like you can’t go through this road, but it will take you two days. Do you want me to guide you to the main road?”
“Aren’t there people living in this village?” Kino asked.
“This place is not available yet. It was made for experimental purposes, built as a temporary training center for the pioneers,” Lieutenant Cole answered.
“That’s weird. We came here to give something to a person who lived here in the past year,” Hermes said. The corner of Lieutenant Cole’s lips tensed a little.
He asked, “What’s the address?”
Kino replied, “‘C.O. Post Office 42nd Pioneer Village’, for——”
“A boy named Logue, right?” Lieutenant Cole said. He took off his sunglasses, and revealed eyes as blue as Inertia’s.


In a place a little ways off the village, there was a building built on the highest place in the area. It was a concrete two-storey building with no decoration whatsoever, and with a big antenna on its roof.
The four-wheel drive silently stopped in front of the building, immediately followed by the roar of Hermes’ engine.
Lieutenant Cole opened the entrance with a key, and invited Kino and Hermes inside.
The dim office-like room was furnished with a small desk and chairs, and lined up with empty document shelves. Lieutenant Cole offered Kino a seat, hung his cap on the wall, and turned to open the firmly shut sliding doors. Light entered, illuminating its clean interior.
Kino propped Hermes on his center stand beside her own chair. Then she hung her coat and cap on top of him.
Lieutenant Cole sat opposite Kino. He placed his elbows on the desk and joined his hands on his forehead. He closed his eyes and took a long, quiet breath. Then he lifted his face, and spoke in a lifeless voice.
“Welcome to the ‘post office’.”


Kino took out a small box from her jacket’s pocket. She opened it and presented the object inside on her palm.
It was a tiny brooch carved out from something white. It was a little rough, but it can be recognized as a bird from its form. Short, golden hair was glued on its wings and cockscomb.
“It’s apparently a charm. From Inertia to Logue.”
Kino placed the box on the table. Lieutenant Cole did not touch it, and only looked at it.
“Are you assigned to the post office?” Kino asked.
“Yes. In the countryside, some soldiers work for the post office. I worked here before. No… I’m still working here even now.”
“Then Kino’s job ends here since she has already delivered it. Shall we go now?” Hermes said bluntly and with a hint of sarcasm. Lieutenant Cole closed his eyes and shook his head.
“Ah… what in the world…,” he muttered weakly.
“Will you hand this to the boy?” Kino asked.
Lieutenant Cole shook his head and spoke with a clear voice. “The possibility of that happening is zero. It can’t be done.”
“Why?” Hermes asked.
Lieutenant Cole answered.
“Because he has died a long time ago. Half a year ago. To be exact, he was killed half a year and four days ago.”


“I take it that you know about the disease, and the ongoing development of a cure for it?”
“Yes.”
“Yup.”
“And I believe you’ve heard about the pioneers?”
“Yes.”
“Yup.”
“But, you don’t know about the ‘special pioneers’, do you?”
“We don’t.”
“What’s that again?”
“To put it simply… they are people gathered together to be killed.”
“……. Please continue.”
“Of course… I’ll tell you everything that I know. It’s not enough to call it an epidemic in the city… it’s an illness that has made a lot of people suffer——. Our country had been working to fight this illness. It has become a national concern. We had been in a painful struggle against this most wicked of enemies. We wanted to find a cure as soon as possible. We have suffered for countless years, and so we want to make sure that no one will die from this disease anymore.”
“Okay.”
“Uh-huh.”
“Then, three years ago… we realized the limits of animal testing. Many doctors began to insist on the necessity of experiments on living humans. They advocated the belief that development of the cure would be hastened if live human subjects were to be used. Eventually, this view became accepted.”
“……”
“And then?”
“There are different kinds of people who yearned to become pioneers. But in practice, being chosen has little to do with passing the exams. Instead, we only choose among families who belonged to the poorest sectors, and who don’t have any other relatives. And from them, we created a group of pioneers.”
“And they are the ‘special pioneers’?”
“Yes. They came, full of hopes and happiness in their hearts, and started to live in the villages. The security escorts were there to guard them and make sure that no one would escape…. But you see…! It wasn’t decided yet that they will be used for experiments. Maybe the cure would be completed before they get ‘used’. If so, then they will truly be a group of pioneers, and live in that village in peace…”
“I see.” 
“But that didn’t happen.”
“Half a year ago, it was finally decided that all of the villagers will become test subjects. And it was carried out… by us. One night, we attacked them with sleeping gas and carried them away. We locked them up inside a truck… I’ve only seen up to that point. I only heard that lively boy who looked up to me like an older brother calling after me, and that was it. They were transported to the basement of an establishment inside the city, and were ‘used’ in various kinds of experiments. I don’t know the details. I don’t even want to know. I only heard from my superior officer that half a year and four days ago, the boy was… dissected alive, turned into a specimen, and transferred to a tiny glass bottle. Soon after, I heard that they completed a medicine that can slow down the advance of the disease. Since then, that village had been preserved.”
“I understand. But I have one more question.”
“The letters.” 
“Yes. I continued to write them. I am tasked with the inspection of letters, perhaps to make sure that there’s nothing suspicious about them. Even so, for a letter from the city to arrive here… needs an approval of an ‘elite’. There are only a few letters that come, since receiving them will gain you hatred rather than admiration. Moreover, being ‘special pioneers’, it’s unlikely for them to receive any. Very unlikely.”
“But…”
“I see.”
“… But letters came from that girl every month without fail. And he wrote back each time. There’s a machine that lets me read what’s inside those letters without having to open them. He encouraged the girl who could not go out due to her illness, and she encouraged the boy to do his best out in the countryside. Her only dream was to completely recover and live in the countryside together with that boy.”


Lieutenant Cole suddenly tore at his hair with hands. And then he howled,
“Just one letter! Just one letter half a year ago! If only I had written her ‘I won’t be able to send you letters because I’m busy.’ No! I should have crumpled her letters as soon as they came! That’s what I should have done! But why?! Why did I have to write her replies?! There’s something wrong with me! To do such a thing!”
“But you couldn’t stop yourself from doing it, eh?” Hermes asked without any change in his tone.
Lieutenant Cole pressed on his head with his hands.
“Month after month… I feared that I would get exposed. Each time I opened the envelope, I was scared that the words ‘Who are you?’ would be written there. Even so… Even so…”
Then he lifted his face. With eyes that seemed as if they were about to shed tears, the soldier looked at the tiny bird before him.
“Then that is for you. Please accept it,” Kino said gently.
“I understand…,” he replied with a soft voice, and muttered. “Then I guess I’ll have to write a reply.”
Lieutenant Cole lifted the bird with his hands. He silently closed the box, stood up, and stowed it inside the shelf behind him.
“Hey,” Hermes asked as Lieutenant Cole returned to his seat. “Will you be observing and preserving the village again?”
Lieutenant Cole nodded. “Yes, we’ll do that again. There are plans to send in the next batch of test subjects. Again, we will escort and guard the villagers, and I will be in charge of post office work.” Then he narrowed his eyes and spoke gently. “It’s for the sake of the country. For the sake of many people. And above all… it’s for her future.”
“I understand. Thank you for the story. We’ll be on our way.”
Lieutenant Cole scrutinized the traveler in front of him. “Miss Kino, thank you very much, and… I’m sorry.”
He kicked off the table. Kino received a direct hit on her upper body and collapsed backwards. When she managed to get rid of the desk above her chest, Lieutenant Cole stepped on the holster containing Canon with his right foot.
The blue-eyed soldier silently looked at the opponent he resolved to kill. He pulled out the dagger with an unwavering movement honed from practice, and lunged forward, supporting it with his left hand.
Kino slipped her right hand in her jacket’s left cuff, and grasped the knife in there.


The scenery in and out of the walls was the same.
It was a rough terrain spanned by brown mountains, without a single blade of grass growing on it. Only the endless stretch of high walls seemed to have sprouted from the ground, both of its sides sporting unchanging scenery.
Underneath the clear, almost transparent sky was a single road. It was a simple road made from hardened earth that was freed from stones. It weaved its way through the valley.
Kino and Hermes rode west on the road, raising up dry dust behind them.
Kino’s head and the brim of her hat were slightly lowered, preventing the winter sun from getting in the way of her vision.
“Kino, that’s rare,” Hermes said.
“Hm? …Yeah. Just for the time being, since we’re still inside the country,” Kino answered.


Ten days after the traveler left.
A nurse approached the white-skinned, golden-headed, blue-eyed girl seated on her bed. She was carrying medicine, as well as a letter.
The nurse reminded her to drink the medicine first, then she went out of the room and left the girl alone.
As she was told, the girl first drank her medicine.
With a paper knife, the girl carefully opened the letter that was imprinted only with the hospital’s name and the room number.
Inside was a checker-patterned envelope stamped with  the words, ‘Sterilized & Inspected’ in big print. The girl held back her eagerness, and cut the seal carefully. A sheet of folded paper emerged from it.
The blue eyes ran through the words written with a simple handwriting: ‘Thank you so much for the gift. When you get well, please come to village. Then let’s have a long talk.’
Then the girl smiled, and on the verge of tears, held the letter closely to her heart.















"
27,v4c1,4,1,"It was inside a forest of snow.
The snow that accumulated in one winter crushed all of the grass underneath. Only the tall trees with long and narrow leaves grew out of the white surface.
Even now, snow continued to fall from the sky through gaps in the branches. Low, dull clouds were spread out, and the sun's light was weak.
It was a quiet place. Nothing could be heard other than the sound of the occasional snow pattering from the branches. The wind was not blowing either.
In such a place, there was a wild rabbit. Its fur was pure white except for the tips of its ears.
The rabbit advanced a little, leaving shallow footprints in the snow. It stopped and moved its ears and head bit by bit. Then, it leapt forward again.
The rabbit repeated this for a while, then stopped. Its ears moved. A red dot appeared on its white head — a red light.


Inside the same forest was a human.
This person was clad in a hooded snowsuit and overpants that covered up to the tip of her shoes. She wore a furred hat and yellow single-lens goggles. A face warmer extended from her neck up, covering her face.
She was leaning against the trunk of a tree, sitting with her legs bent and knees forward. With both hands, she was balancing a hand persuader (Note: A gun. In this case, a pistol) placed between her knees. The persuader was a slender automatic fitted with a harmonica-shaped silencer. A red light extended from the tiny hole under the barrel — a laser sight for alignment with the target. This light was aiming towards the head of the rabbit.
She breathed out a wisp of white air. She slowly pressed the trigger. A clink was heard from inside the persuader.
The next instant, blood spurted out from where the red point of light marked the rabbit’s head.
The rabbit trembled for a moment but soon fell and stopped moving. The blood from its head slightly stained its white fur, and the snow beneath it melted a little.


Inside the forest was one road. The road was perfectly straight, cutting its way through the trees. It was covered with hardened, pure white snow.
On top of this road was a parked motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. It cannot fly). Its back seat was converted into a sturdy carrier. However, there was no luggage on top; only a bag was tied to it.
The motorrad was customized to be able to run on snow. There were studs around both tires to pierce through the frozen road. On the frame in front of the engine, arms resembling a bicycle’s training wheels stuck out on both sides. On the tips of these arms were planks for the feet to be placed in, at the bottom of which were tiny skis. This was to prevent the motorrad from falling down in case the tires slid.
“I caught one, Hermes.” The human greeted the motorrad as she appeared from inside the forest. The rabbit, with its legs tied together, was dangling upside down from her hands. A covered holster was attached obliquely in front of her stomach.
The motorrad called Hermes replied cheerfully, “Good job! With this, you don’t have to lessen your supply of portable rations, Kino.”
The human called Kino nodded, put the rabbit inside the bag, and secured it onto Hermes’ carrier.
Kino took off her goggles and bandanna and lowered her face warmer. It was a person around mid-teens, with short black hair, big eyes, and a face carrying an intrepid expression. She lightly wiped off the sweat on her face and fixed her hat. Then she spoke,
“Now, let’s hurry back. If those guys die, I’ll be in a bind.”
“In a bind?” Hermes asked.
“What I mean is, I would lose face.”
“To whom?” Hermes asked once more.
“The rabbit,” Kino answered.
Kino turned on Hermes’ engine. The sound of the engine broke the stillness of the forest. Kino fixed on her goggles and face warmer, placed both of her feet on the support skis, and launched Hermes off.


In one corner of the white road was a relatively new kind of truck. The tires and lower half of its body was completely buried in the snow, rendering it immobile. Snow had accumulated heavily on its roof.
A bit ways off the truck, on the border between the forest and the road, there was a big tent. Only the place where the dome-shaped tent stood was below the surface, as if the snow there caved in.
Eventually, the sound of an engine was heard, followed right after by the arrival of Kino and Hermes.
One man crawled out and peeked from inside the tent. The face of the man, who seemed to be about thirty, looked like it couldn’t be any thinner. His beard and hair had grown as much as it could, and the winter clothes he wore were dirty all over.
Kino took out the rabbit from the bag and showed it to the man. The man looked up at it with a delighted face and put his head back inside the tent. Then two other men stuck their heads out — a man wearing eyeglasses who seemed to be in his twenties, and a man in his forties who had greying hair. Both looked pitifully thin but smiled from ear to ear when they saw the rabbit.
“I’ll cook it for you. Let me borrow a pot,” Kino said.
“It’s good enough! We’ll eat it raw!” The man in his thirties said, his face wrought with impatience.
The other men pleaded to let them eat it right away, but Kino shook her head.
“That won’t do. It would be terrible if you get infected with Tularemia[2] or something.”
A look of disappointment loomed over the men, but they obediently took out two pots of different sizes from the tent. Kino took the pots and told them,
“I’ll call you when it’s done, so please rest until then.”
“Yes, we understand…. Miss Kino…” The man in his thirties called out to Kino who had already turned around.
“What is it?”
The man gazed straight into Kino’s eyes.
“Thanks.”
Kino smiled lightly. “It’s still too early for that, but… you’re welcome.”


The morning before.
Kino and Hermes were riding on the frozen road, thick clouds overhead.
Thanks to the studded tires and support skis, they were able to ride at a considerable speed.
Other than the bag, Hermes’ rear carrier was loaded with a winter tent, a sleeping bag, and lots of traveling luggage.
Then Hermes spoke all of a sudden, “There’s a truck up ahead.”
Kino slowly loosened the accelerator. She rode using the momentum, and without using the brakes, she slowly stopped in front of the truck buried in the snow. She cut the engine, climbed off Hermes, and let down her goggles and face warmer.
Kino opened the cover of the holster in front of her stomach and took out the persuader inside with her right hand. It was the revolver-type she called ‘Canon’.
As Kino approached the truck, she soon noticed the tent near it. Then she met the gaze of a man who hurriedly poked his head out of the tent’s opening.
The bearded man in his thirties looked at Kino with a surprised face. Kino returned Canon in its holster but did not let go of its grip as she greeted the man with a ‘hello’.
Without answering Kino, the man crawled out of the tent and stood up feebly. From the tent, two other men peeked out with equally surprised expressions.
The man looked at Kino and Hermes, and asked with a weak voice, “Y-you travel with that motorrad, don’t you…? C-can you spare us some food…?”
While looking at their pitiful state, Hermes spoke nonchalantly. “I see. I think I understand what your circumstances are.”
“I’m sorry, but I have none. Since when were you here?” Kino said.
“Don’t be surprised…. We’ve been here since the beginning of winter.”
Kino’s face faintly gave away a look of surprise, while Hermes spoke. “I am very surprised.”
“Yeah. Snow fell earlier than we expected. Soon it turned into a furious snowstorm, and we were passed up here ever since…”
“It’s a good thing you didn’t pass away,” Hermes said, but nobody laughed.[3]
“And I suppose there’s no food in that truck, either,” Kino asked to confirm, and the men replied in anguish,
“There was food, but we ate everything already… that was a long time ago. Of course, we had plenty, but we didn’t expect that we would be held up like this. We were careless. Since then, we’ve been waiting for someone to pass here. We beg you! Please share with us something, anything we could eat…. There are three of us…”
The man pointed to the tent, and the two men looked at Kino with a clinging expression.
“We beg you…”
The man curled his fists together and appealed to Kino. Kino breathed lightly before she replied. “I do have portable rations. But I have to leave enough for myself. The reserves I have would be barely enough for three.”
The men gulped as they listened to Kino.
“However,” Kino continued. The men raised their faces.
“I can hunt something for you. I’m sure there are animals around this area, and since it’s starting to get warmer, I would be able to catch one somehow. If you regain enough strength, you might be able to move your truck. You still have fuel, don’t you?”
“Yes, there’s still some left! Then that means…?” The man happily asked Kino in return. Kino felt the men’s warm, expectant gazes, and lightly nodded.
“Yes. I’ll accompany you for a few days.”
Broad smiles appeared on their faces upon hearing Kino’s words. They thanked her in chorus.
“Your name is?” the man in his thirties asked.
“Kino. This here is Hermes.”
“Miss Kino, eh? Here, take a look at this.”
While saying so, the man took out a small box from his pocket. He opened it and showed it to Kino. Inside was a ring. It was a silver ring set with several small green gems.
“I believe this has a bit of value. It’s our appreciation for your help. Please take it.”
“It’s still too early to thank me.”
“That’s fine. Take it. I wanted to take this back home for my wife, but it would be pointless if I die here.”
“……”
Kino took the box in her hands and looked at it. She gazed at it for a while without any discernable change in her expression.
“I understand. I’ll take this as a reward after everything is over. Until that time, I’ll hold on to it.”
Kino put the box in her pocket and instructed the men. “Please wait here for a while. I’ll catch some game. I’ll leave my luggage here, so please watch it for me until I return. Just so you know, meat is more delicious than my portable rations.”
Kino removed all of her luggage from Hermes and tied up just one bag on the carrier.
And then she went out to hunt.


Kino started to cook.
She dug up the snow beside a tree until the ground became visible. Here she put together solid fuel, old newspapers, and some twigs, and set it on fire. She suspended the pot to the tree with a rope and adjusted it so that it would be on top of the flame. Then she put some clean snow inside.
Kino placed the rabbit on top of the iron plate she normally used for her shooting practice. She looked at the motionless rabbit for a moment, then closed her eyes for a few seconds more.
After a simple silent prayer, she began to cut it apart.
Kino removed the gloves she wore in favor of thin rubber gloves, which she used to cover up to the sleeves of her winter suit.
Then she took out a folding hunting knife and made cuts around the fur near the center of the rabbit’s abdomen.
After this, she pulled the fur sideways with both hands. She continued to pull until the neck and the tips of the feet were bare, and then cut off the rabbit’s hide from the rest of its body.
The rabbit, a size smaller than before, had turned into a pink mass of flesh.
Kino cut open the abdomen of the rabbit from the throat down to the anal area and took out its internal organs. She wiped the hollow interior of the wide-open belly using some snow and paper, and lightly drained the water.
To remove the limbs, Kino made cuts around the region where they connected with the body, broke the hip joints, and severed the hind legs with the knees. Then she chopped the torso into appropriate sizes.
After she finished cutting it up, the rabbit has become ‘meat’ that could normally be sold in shops.
Kino adjusted the bonfire and scooped out the scraps from the water in the pot.
Then she put the meat into the pot. Using snow, she wiped the iron plate she used in place of a chopping board and hoisted it above the fire to sterilize it. For the first time, Kino removed her rubber gloves.
The meat was ready after a while.


The men were called out by Kino, and with their plates and cups in hand, they wobbled out of the tent towards the fire. Their eyes that looked big in their gaunt faces had a bizarre glint in them.
Kino sprinkled the meat with salt and pepper and divided it among the men. The men gazed at the food in front of them in silence for a while. Soon, tears trickled down their dirty cheeks.
“Damn. This better not be a dream…”
“You’ll find out once you eat it. It’s not supposed to disappear… maybe,” Kino said.
The men broke the meat into small pieces with their fingers and slowly carried it to their mouths. They chewed several times before gulping it down, then closed their eyes and inhaled deeply.
“It’s so good…” The man in his forties muttered in between his broken sobs.
“Delicious…” The man in his twenties said as his tears trickled down silently, his hands working on the food slowly but incessantly.
The last man’s eyes remained closed as he chewed on the meat for a while longer, as if confirming that it was real, and swallowed. “Yeah. It’s really delicious. It has been such a long time since we last tasted something this good…. It’s a bit salty though.”
The men laughed as they wept. They rubbed their teary faces with their hands, and the dirt on their faces was washed off, if only a little.
Kino made some tea with the hot water in the other pot and filled the men’s cups. She handed the men some tablets.
“Those are vitamin tablets. They’re my spares.”
“Thanks. It’s a full course meal.”
“Kino, are you fine with us eating all the meat?” the man in his twenties asked.
“I thought there would be more than enough for everybody, but in your condition, it seems like you could finish everything. I’m fine with the usual stuff I have,” Kino said, showing them the square, clay-like portable rations.
“Thank you.” “Thanks.” The men meekly expressed their gratitude.
“If you can, please thank that guy over there too.” Kino pointed to the tree.
On the branch of the tree were the fur and pieces of the upper and lower body of the rabbit. The four looked at the dark, round eyes that has lost its light.
Then, the men put down their plates and cups on top of the snow, clasped their hands together in front of their faces, and closed their eyes.
Kino, and Hermes who was parked behind her, looked at the men as they softly expressed their gratitude to their God.
“God, thank you. For us, the blood of another being was sacrificed…. And God, please forgive us for having to kill others to survive…”
The prayer of the men continued for a while, and Kino looked at them while eating the unappetizing portable rations.
Afterwards, the men took their time in finishing all of the meat.


As the day came to a close, the sky, which was not too bright in the first place, became even darker. The scenery changed into a gray hue that quietly grew thicker.
Kino spread out her one-person tent on the opposite side of the men’s tent, interposed with the truck.
She made some tea for the men by the end of the day. They thanked her once more and returned to their own tent.
Kino covered Hermes’ engine and tank, and slipped into her own tent.


The next morning.
The surroundings were still dark when Kino woke up. As usual, the sky was covered with clouds, and powdery snow fluttered about.
Kino exercised on top of the snow and practiced drawing out Canon several times.
After eating her portable rations alone, she tapped Hermes awake, turned on his engine, and strapped her bag on his carrier.
She asked the men who were stirred awake with the engine’s roar to bring their cups. She put some snow in the cups and placed them on Hermes’ engine and exhaust pipe. The snow soon melted.
“My engine was not made to make hot water, you know.”
“Then that means you can be useful to me in many ways, Hermes.”


That day.
Once again, Kino and Hermes went out to hunt. She brought down two big rabbits in a row.
Upon returning, she cut them apart like she did the day before. She cooked the first one in the afternoon in the same manner.
The men came out of the tent, and once again, gave thanks after their meal. And then, they returned to their tents and rested.
Kino cut down a branch of the tree for kindling and cooked the other piece of meat as evening neared.
The men ate everything. The neatly gnawed bones piled up beside the bonfire.
While eating, the men told Kino about their country with smiles on their faces.
“In case you come to visit, we’ll treat you to anything, you’d get twice as heavy!” they promised Kino.
As they regained their body strength, they were eventually able to walk normally without staggering.


By nightfall, the snow has completely stopped falling and rifts manifested on the clouds little by little. The stars became visible in the sky one by one.
Kino was inside her sleeping bag in her tent. Hermes, who was parked right in front of the tent, spoke. “Kino, are you awake?”
“Yeah.”
“Is it really okay for you to go out of your way like this?”
“It’s not. Even though it’s getting somewhat warmer, I want to get out of this forest as soon as possible.”
“Then why?”
“Because there’s the reward. I accepted the ring.”
“What’s so great about that thing?” Hermes said.
For a while, there was a rummaging sound from inside the tent. And then, Kino gently slipped her left hand under the hem. The ring was inserted on her middle finger.
“What do you think?” Kino asked, turning her hand over.
“It doesn’t suit you,” Hermes replied immediately. She slowly drew back her hand.
“…I think so too. It would be on the way when I grip your clutch. But it must be worth something if I sell it. Besides, it’s not a bad thing to do an act of mercy from time to time,” she answered back.
“Whatever,” was Hermes’ only reply.


The next day, that is, the morning of the third day since Kino met the men.
The sky was tinged a light blue when she woke up. It was absolutely clear and devoid of clouds.
The orange lump of light began to rise behind Kino as she performed her morning exercises. Her shadow became longer and extended on top of the snow.
Soon, the men woke up. They tried to walk steadily and prepared hot water on their own.
“I see you’re doing much better now,” Kino said, and the men nodded.
“Yeah, thanks.”
For breakfast, Kino divided her portable rations among themselves. The four ate their meal rather uncomfortably.
During their after-meal tea, the men talked merrily about their home country.
“Those folks will surely be surprised once we get home. None of them would think that we would get stranded like this. I’m sure they believed that we were shot dead.”
“They probably made graves for us already.”
“Isn’t that funny? We could visit our own graves.”
When the man in his thirties asked Kino about her home country, Kino only answered with a shake of her head.
“I see… sorry about that,” the man said, and brought the discussion to a close.


As the sun went up, the air slowly but steadily became warmer.
The men talked to Kino about moving their truck. If they divided work and dug up the snow around the truck to create a slope, they could possibly get the truck out of its current condition of being buried. As long as the truck was still in running condition, they could get to the nearest country.
The man in his thirties asked Kino, “First, we want to remove our luggage from the vehicle. It would be nice if you can help.”
Kino and the men turned to the back of the truck.
The truck’s loading platform had three locks. The man in his thirties asked for the keys of the other two, opened the door and went inside. After a while, they heard some clicking sounds, and the man in his forties separated Kino a bit and talked to her.
“Miss Kino, will that motorrad be fine?”
Kino, who did not understand what he meant, turned around. At the same time, the man in his thirties quickly got out of the truck’s platform. He was holding a long persuader with both hands and aiming it towards Kino.
The moment Kino saw the man’s persuader, she reached for her holster with her right hand but stopped herself from pulling Canon out. She calmly faced the persuader pointed at her.
“Good decision. If you pulled out that persuader, I would have shot you without a moment’s delay,” the man said as he climbed down the platform. There was no opening in his stance.
“Well, thanks for that,” Kino said with her usual tone without any hint of surprise. The other two men backed off from Kino a few steps, their faces now stern.
The man in his thirties spoke. “The truth is I wouldn’t have fired at you. We take pride in delivering our important goods without a single scratch, you see.”
“Goods?” Kino asked, and the man in his forties answered.
“Yeah. We work for an employment agency. What we refer to as ‘goods’ are people.”
Hermes, who was parked a bit ways off behind Kino, spoke in a tone not different from usual. “Oh, so you guys are kidnappers. Or to be more specific, slave traders.”
“You don’t have to put it so bluntly… but well, that’s correct. Now that we are strong enough to move, we have to do our real job. So, Miss Kino, we will take you with us to a place where someone would buy you. Don’t put up any resistance now.”
“Well, that’s that, but I’m a little concerned,” Hermes said.
“Don’t worry, Hermes. Your partner is quite a beauty. She’ll shine with a bit of polishing, and because she’s young, she’ll definitely be sold for a high price. We always adorn our goods with jewels and pretty clothes; it’s a complete package. We’re not going to give her any injuries,” the man in his forties assured.
“Anyway, you sure make it sound easy,” Kino replied indifferently, her body not moving an inch.
While gazing into Kino’s eyes, the man in his thirties spoke with his persuader still aimed at her. “Please don’t think badly of us. We are truly grateful to you for saving us. It was great… really great. However, you can say that we are wolves. And wolves have no choice but to live like wolves. This is in order for us to survive, you see.”
“I see.” Kino slowly raised her hands.
“Okay. Now, remove that revolver in front of your stomach. Slowly, with your left hand.”
Kino slowly removed Canon’s holster from her belt with her left hand.
“Throw it away.”
Kino tossed it, and it fell between her and the men. There was a thud, and it was stuck halfway into the snow.
The man in his twenties went to pick it up, but the man in his forties beside him stopped him and spoke. “Remove your winter suit. Slowly. One hand at a time, and throw it up front.”
Kino removed her winter suit as she was told. Underneath, she was wearing a black jacket fastened with a wide belt on the waist. There were several pouches attached to the belt.
“Face to the back. Slowly now.”
Kino turned around. Lightly inserted on her belt was the holstered persuader she used to shoot down the rabbits. Kino called this one ‘Woodsman’.
“I knew it. Pull that persuader out slowly with your right hand. Then throw it. Slowly, remember.”
“I’m impressed you knew,” Kino said while looking at Hermes. With her right hand, she gripped Woodsman’s barrel, removed it from its holster and tossed it away.
“Face here, hands up. Slowly.”
Kino raised both hands and slowly faced the men.
Two of them tried to approach Kino, but this time, the man in his twenties stopped them.
“Wait. You have a knife, right? Where is it?”
Kino, with a somewhat dejected look, replied bluntly. “I have them all over.”
“Throw them all away.”
Kino slowly put her right hand in the pocket at her jacket’s hem. She took out the folding knife she used for cooking and flung it away.
Kino slowly reached out for the pouches on her belt with her right hand. From there, she pulled out the grip of a knife, flicked open the folding blade, locking it automatically. She threw this away.
Kino slowly put her right hand inside the left cuff of her jacket and extracted a double-edged knife. She tossed it. And then, she put her left hand inside the right cuff and took out a similar knife, and threw it away.
“……”
The men silently looked on. Kino slowly began to take off her overpants. She zipped down the fastener on her side and removed it one leg at a time. The boots and pants she was wearing underneath could now be seen.
Kino slowly squatted down and took out a thin knife from a sheath tied up on the shin part of her boots. She threw it away. She removed a similar knife from her left leg with her left hand and tossed it.
The knife fell down and hit the other knives on the ground, making a clinking sound.
“Are you… a knife merchant?” the man in his thirties muttered impulsively.
Kino slowly reached at the belt behind her right waist with her right hand and pulled out a sheathed knife. It was a knife with a double-edged blade around fifteen centimeters in length, and a fat, cylindrical grip.
Kino gripped it with her right hand and held the blade part with her left.
She spoke slowly, looking at the eyes of the man holding the persuader. “This one’s the last.”
“Throw it away,” said the man in his thirties. A red dot appeared on his forehead — a red light.
Bang bang bang!
There were three gunshots in succession. Between the blade and the grip of the knife were four small holes, from three of which bullets flew out.
Blood spurted out of the place where the red point of light marked the man’s forehead.
At the same moment, as the shots were heard, the man in his forties saw Kino advancing towards him and flailed his left hand. Kino passed underneath and restrained the man’s left hand from behind with her left. She stabbed all of the knife’s length through the left side of his back.
“Guh—!”
At the same time as the man let out this sound, the man that had three holes opened in his forehead collapsed.
Kino then pushed forward the knife and the man towards the man in his twenties.
As the thin man fell over, Kino retrieved Canon from the snow.
Kino immediately raised the hammer and stood in front of the man, pinned on his back underneath the corpse.
“Aaaah—!”
The man shrieked. Kino took a short glance towards the other man whose face was stained red with blood. And then she pointed Canon towards the last man.
“Save m——”
There was a thunderous roar and a white smoke as Kino’s right hand bounded up. Several of the man’s teeth burst flying like popcorn.
The man’s head leaped as if hit by an electric shock, then became still. Blood pooled from inside his mouth, and at once, the air pushing out of the lungs bubbled out. The blood overflowed, melting the snow beneath the man’s neck little by little.
Kino stood in front of the three men’s corpses. There was a faint steam rising up from the blood.
“That was a close call,” Hermes said to Kino from behind. “Are you hurt?”
“Nope,” was Kino’s only reply. Then she added, “That was scary. I thought it was the end for me.”
Kino stood for a while, holding Canon in her right hand.
In the middle of the clear blue sky and the glittering snowscape, the sound of Kino’s molars grinding in fear resounded.


“Are you fine now?” Hermes asked.
“I’m okay now,” Kino nodded. Steam no longer came out from the corpses.
Kino stood in front of the truck’s loading platform.
While holding Canon cautiously, she slowly opened the door.
“I see,” Kino muttered, and looked for a while inside the truck. And then, she opened both doors. Light shone inside the truck.
A number of white bones rolled off from the narrow interior of the truck.
Human bones. Thin ribs. Small finger bones. Broken pelvic bones shaped like spatulas. Broken thighbones — the marrow inside thoroughly slurped.
Several used up containers of solid fuel rolled off. An iron plate was torn off from one part of the truck. Above it, there were several charred pieces of a backbone.
In one corner of the truck was the head of the person who owned these bones.
Long blonde hair was tied on the truck’s pipe, from which the head was suspended, lightly facing downwards. It was a young girl, perhaps about the same age as Kino.
The eyes and the nose were gone. There were only the silently gaping black holes, the whittled skin and flesh of the cheeks and jaws, and the exposed part of the skull underneath the face. The lower jaw was barely connected to the rest of the head.
A hole as big as a person’s fist was gaping wide on the forehead. All of the brain was gone.
Hung neatly in one corner opposite the head was a bright yellow dress.
“…Hermes, can you see it?” Kino asked.
“Yup. Food scraps,” Hermes answered.
Kino looked at the corpses of the men by her feet.
“Before that, this was their important ‘goods’ eh…”
“And before that?” Hermes asked, catching Kino's mumbled words.
While looking at the glittering blonde hair, Kino spoke gently.
“I don’t know.”
As Kino slowly closed the door, she spoke to the girl.
“It’s not right. But, they didn’t want to die.”


“We’ve been held up so much. Let’s leave as soon as possible,” Kino said, picking up all the knives she tossed earlier.
Snow accumulated inside the Woodsman's barrel. Kino picked it up, and without aiming at anything in particular, fired two shots. Then she closed the safety and returned it behind her waist.
She took the knife piercing the back of the man with one forceful pull. She thrust the bloodied blade in the snow back and forth until it was clean. Then she wiped it with the clothes of the dead man.
Kino opened the screwed lid at the bottom of the knife’s grip. She took out three small, empty cartridges from inside. Then she took out Woodsman’s spare bullets from her belt and put them inside the knife’s grip.
And then she returned this persuader-knife to its sheath in her right waist.
Kino put on her overpants and winter suit. Then she returned Canon to its original place.
She quickly packed her tent and loaded her luggage on Hermes. Then she started the engine.
Suddenly, Kino returned to the side of the truck. She squatted beside the corpse holding the persuader.
She removed the glove in her left hand. A ring was inserted on her middle finger. It was a silver ring, with several small green gems attached to it.
Kino looked at her left hand for a few seconds.
Kino removed the ring and took out the box from her pocket. She put it inside the man’s breast pocket. And then she spoke to him softly.
“I’m returning this to you… because I wasn’t able to save you in the end.”
Then Hermes spoke with a voice as soft as Kino’s,
“What? I thought you liked that thing?”


Kino straddled Hermes. She covered her face with her hat and goggles.
Kino lightly revved the accelerator, and the engine roared in excellent condition.
“Shall we go?” Hermes proposed.
“Yeah.”
Kino turned her head back lightly to check whether she left anything. Then she looked at the remains of the three rabbits lined up on the branch of the tree.
“Please don’t think badly of us. We’re only humans, after all.”
The motorrad ran off. It passed through the truck, the tent, and what remained of the four corpses, and soon disappeared. 















"
28,v4c2,4,2,"I’m home.
The gray edifice visible beyond the thick forest are the walls of the place where I was born in, the country where I spent fifteen years of my life. Thanks to the trees cleared out of the way, I could make out the form of the lofty watchtower. There’s no mistaking it.
Though I haven’t seen it for five years, it was exactly as I remember it. For a while, I was looking dazedly at the scenery as if I was in a dream.
I hoisted my heavy luggage once again, and began to walk slowly along the river towards my hometown.
Just a little bit more. Perhaps I’ll arrive at the gates before it gets dark.


I didn’t have a father; he died before I was born. My mother made a living by selling jam she prepares at home. Her jam had a good reputation, so we lived happily and never had to worry of becoming poor.
Even back when I was a child, this country has always been peaceful, and at the same time, boring. Being a country that lives on harvested crops, our lives consisted of doing the same tasks every day. And on top of this, I would see my mother’s form boiling the same fruits day in and day out.
When I turned eleven or twelve, I started to seriously think about being an adventurer. I’ll get out of this country, go to many different places, and live each day of my life in excitement and discovery.
These feelings grew stronger and stronger, and at last on my fifteenth birthday, I decided to leave the country.


Of course, my mother was strongly against it.
“A human is best suited to live in the place where he was born. Why can’t you understand that?” So my mother said.
But of course, these things did not matter to me. Because she did her best to raise me on her own, I felt a little bad about leaving her, but I was too busy chasing my dreams.
Other than my mother, there was one other person who held me back. It’s Toto.
A girl younger than me by five years, Toto was adopted by my mother when I was only ten. It was because her dead parents were close friends of my mother.
Toto was a very quiet and shy girl. She couldn’t deal with people all that well, and avoided others all the time, so she could not even attend school.
Eventually, Toto learned how to make jam from mother and became good at it in no time. From then on, she always helped mother.
“Unlike the clumsy you, this girl is really useful. After I die, she’ll inherit my recipes and the shop, and you’ll be good enough as a bodyguard, right Schwarz?” I would be teased by my mother, who could now relax thanks to Toto.


Before long, Toto and I became close to each other. We often played together when we have no work to do.
The game we like best is pretending to have a gunfight. With a water pistol, I would hide in ambush and suddenly jump out and surprise Toto.
“If you don’t dodge, you’ll get hit! If you dodge, I’ll hit you!”
If I hit her I win, but when Toto realizes my ambush and dodge, she wins.
At first, I would always win and Toto ends up soaked to the skin. But eventually, Toto would find me no matter where I hide, and would quickly dodge even before I get to say my little speech. And then I wouldn’t win at all. Toto would always laugh heartily, seeing how frustrated I was.


“Do you really have to leave no matter what? I don’t want you to go, Master Schwarz. I want us to live together right here, always.”
These words, which Toto would say while staring intently at me, were much stronger than my mother’s pleadings, and would always sway my decision to leave.
Maybe the one I loved more than anybody else at that time was this little girl who adored me.
Even so, I have already made my decision, and on the morning of my fifteenth birthday, I set off. Those that I left, my country, my mother, and most especially, Toto — I tried my best not to think of them.
And Toto’s words of farewell were,
“I’m sure you’ll come home someday. Master Schwarz, you will definitely return. Until that day, I will always be right here waiting…”


I abandoned my country for a journey. But in the end, it granted me none of the things I desired. My vague dreams of living every day of my life in excitement and adventure, was not there. It was nowhere.
There was a severe drought in the first country I arrived in, and only harsh farm work awaited anyone who came looking for a job. But in order to earn my future travel expenses, I had to live there for a year.
In the next country, I was recruited as a mercenary for a war. I volunteered, hoping to become a distinguished hero, but all I was made to do was carry luggage. To make matters worse, the war did not push through. I was told that I was no longer needed, and I was kicked out of the country once I received my payment.
In the country I lived in next, people excavated jewels for a living.  I gladly joined in, but having no knowledge or experience, I became a mere dog for an opportunist company. I worked every day in a dangerous hole, digging for ore that will never be my own. I quit and waited for spring.
In the last country, I became a prison guard. By chance, there was a vacancy, so I applied. However, this job offered me nothing but free time. The prisoners were very obedient, and have no thoughts of escaping. I got tired of it, and escaped as soon as I found an opportunity. How ironic — it’s the guard who ran away instead of the prisoners.
After that, nothing satisfied me, so I ended up wandering aimlessly from place to place. I was not able to stay long in any one country, and there was no job I was interested enough to take. Day by day, my effort all goes to searching for food inside the forest, the seas, and rivers.
I continued living this way for half a year, before I finally decided to go back to my country.


I walked for some time since I first saw the walls, and just when its height seemed twice as much as before, I heard the sound of splashing water — animals, no doubt.
I couldn’t see through the thick vegetation, but I could hear the noise coming from the direction of my country, just ahead of me. I pulled out the revolver from the holster on my waist. I slowly distanced myself from the river and took a little detour. And then I peered at the river from afar.
There was a human. At the opposite bank, there was a girl with only her underwear on, taking a bath. She was around fifteen years old, with a skinny body and short black hair. I knew instantly that it must be Toto.
It seems that Toto did not notice my presence. I gazed at her figure with mixed feelings――.


It was quite painful for me to admit that I was mistaken.
I couldn’t acknowledge it. Even though I have realized long ago that I was wrong for leaving the country, wandering for the sake of a dream that was impossible to achieve, I couldn’t admit it.
But, as I was looking at Toto’s form like this, a bitter smile came to my lips. I accepted it with utmost honesty; that I was such a big fool, and that mother and Toto were right.
In any country, the people born and raised in it would live each day in search of happiness and purpose in the existence that they were given. I used to think that this was a mediocre and dull way to live one’s life.
Now the idea seemed very appealing to me. Together with Toto, we will make a living by preparing and selling jam. Of course, there was no other way of life for us.  It took five years for me to understand this, to realize how foolish I was. It didn’t go to waste.


Now, there are several things that I want to do.
First, I will apologize to my mother and Toto with all my heart, for making them worry about me.
Then I intend to take jam-making more seriously than I ever had in my whole life. I would take care of Toto more than anyone else, she who works so hard each day to make jam as good as my mother’s. If the house has become old, I’ll bake some bricks to repair it. Collecting, drying, and chopping firewood will also become my daily chore from now on.
But before that, the most important thing of all is to show Toto that I have come back home safely.


I took out all the bullets from my revolver: the nine bullets in the cylinder, and the lead ball inside the barrel protruding from the cylinder’s center. I put all of these in my pocket. So that Toto would not notice my presence, I waded through the grass silently, and approached.
Toto has finished bathing, and turned behind to reach her folded clothes. From the bushes on the opposite side of the river, I jumped out while aiming at Toto with the empty revolver. I’ve already decided what I would say to her first.  ‘If you don’t dodge, you’ll get hit! If you dodge, I’ll hit you!’
“If you don’t dodge——”
As I began to speak, I suddenly felt as if someone smacked my chest hard. At the same time, Toto turned towards my direction, and I saw her right hand reaching straight towards me. That hand, for some reason, is wrapped in a white haze. It’s strange; I couldn’t hear anything.
In the next moment, my vision suddenly turned pitch black.
Why? I can’t see anyth——
I	d	ed
T	can’t
Toto
eh?


From the holster hidden underneath the folded clothes, Kino pulled out a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol), and fired as she turned around. It was a high-caliber revolver with an octagonal barrel, which Kino called by the name ‘Canon’. 
The bullet did not miss its aim. It pierced the man’s chest, destroying his heart.  Another bullet quickly followed and entered through the man’s mouth, penetrating his upper jaw and reaching the brain.
The two shots thundered in the forest, making the birds leave their nests. The dead man, still aiming at Kino, splashed up water ostentatiously as he fell into the river.
Kino wiped her body and dressed up. She put on her pants and boots and put on a long black vest on top of her white shirt. She then tightened the belt on her waist, and attached Canon’s holster on her right thigh.
Behind the bushes near the bank was a luggage-laden motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly). It called out to Kino in a loud voice.
“Are you okay?”
Kino replied with a voice just as loud. “Yeah, I wasn’t shot.”
“That’s great then.”
Kino walked to the motorrad’s spot. “Sorry for making you wait, Hermes.”
The motorrad called Hermes spoke in a suspicious tone. “I wonder if he’s a highwayman. But if that’s the case, it’s really strange for him to be alone.”
“I thought he was just a peeping-tom, but… I was really surprised when he suddenly aimed his persuader at me.”
“Even so, Kino. Why would there be a person in a place like this? Well, except for you that is,” Hermes asked.
“He’s probably headed to that place,” Kino said as she looked at the gray walls, her eyes narrowing a little.
Hermes asked once more, “What would he do there? That place is just full of skeletons.”
Kino gave a slight nod, “Who knows?”
“That country was disappointing,” Hermes said in a matter-of-fact tone. 
“Yeah… An epidemic, I’m sure it’s something like that,” Kino muttered as she fetched out a small wooden case from the box attached on Hermes’ rear wheel.
“Everyone’s annihilated?”
“There’s no doubt about it. From the state of bone decomposition, it probably happened more than two years ago.”
“Ooh…” An impressed voice leaked from Hermes. Then all of a sudden, he spoke excitedly, “Yes, that’s it! Kino, that guy was a grave robber. He must be after gold and silver treasures, and makes a living as a ‘yeager’ or a ‘hunter’. He must have thought that you were a rival, so he suddenly tried to kill you.”
“That may, or may not be the case,” said Kino, while filling Cannon with liquid gunpowder and bullets from the wooden case.
After putting away the wooden box, Kino took out a small mirror. She looked at her face and head, then pinched her bangs a little with her free hand.
“Did I cut it too much? What do you think, Hermes?”
“It’s not bad,” Hermes said without any interest.  Kino put away the mirror just as indifferently.
Kino put on her hat and strapped her goggles on. Then she started Hermes’ engine.
“Well, shall we go Hermes? I hope this time we end up in a country with living people. And safe, to boot.”
“Yeah!”
The motorrad sped away into the forest.
With the man still prone on it, the river continued to flow.














"
29,v4c3,4,3,"The earth was an assortment of colors.
The mountains were comprised of numerous, gently sloping highlands. Its summit, valleys, and spurs were all buried under forests rich in plant life. The yellow and crimson mingled with the thick green color of the leaves, creating a mosaic pattern.
A light blue color pervaded the high, almost transparent sky. There was not a single cloud in it.
And amidst the various trees in the forests shedding their autumn foliage was a lone road.
The road of packed earth was softly canopied with fallen leaves. It sewed its way through the mountain in repeating, up and down curves.
On this path ran a single motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly). The fallen leaves danced away as though disturbed by waves caused by a passing ship. The motorrad slowly traced its path through the road that was abound with curves.
The rider of the motorrad was around her mid-teens. She had big eyes and a fearless expression on her face. She was dressed in a brown coat, the excess hem of which was rolled up to her thighs, and had on a brimmed hat with ear flaps, fixed by the band of her goggles so it would not get blown away by the wind.
Behind her seat was a carrier rack, on which a big bag was tied. Below it was the rear wheel flanked by two boxes.
“To be honest, Hermes,” the rider broke the silence as she rode. “The place we’re heading to has a bit… no, has a pretty bad reputation among travelers.”
“Really?” the motorrad called Hermes replied, rather surprised.
“I was told before: ‘It’s not just unsociability, it’s pure coldness towards outsiders,’ or ‘The concept of ‘hospitality’ doesn’t exist in that country,’ or ‘No matter how hard I try, I couldn’t think of it as a good place,’ or ‘They’re probably under the impression that they are the greatest.’”
“……”
“‘You’ll get sick of their unfriendliness,’ or ‘The children will throw stones at you,’ or ‘The stores put the shutters up when a traveler comes, or tell you that they’re out of stock,’ or ‘There’s nothing but terrible food,’ or ‘Be careful you don’t get overcharged.’”
“……”
“‘They make you wait for one day before they let you in,’ or ‘They believe that all travelers are bad,’ or ‘They won’t even point you to a hotel; you’re better off camping out,’ or ‘I don’t want to get near that country ever again,’ or ‘That kind of country should disappear!’”
“……”
“When I told them I’d like to go see it, they all advised me to stop.”
A light smile drifted on the rider’s lips as she finished. Then Hermes asked, unable to hide his shock, “…And yet you would still go, Kino? Even though there are other roads to choose from? Even if you’re free to decide?”
The rider called Kino answered with a smile. “That’s exactly why. I’m really interested to know what kind of country would get that much bad-mouthing. Besides, things may be a little better now.”
“Okay. What if there’s no change at all?”
“That’s fine. We can complain about it once we’re out of the country,” Kino said decisively.
“Well, I suppose so,” Hermes muttered.


Eventually, the road became rugged and winding. The path running up the mountain turned into repetitive steep curves. 
When Kino looked below, she could clearly see the road they have run through, bordered by the trees.
Soon the road reached its peak. Kino stopped Hermes.
The road beyond the spur becomes downhill. On the right, the ridge lines culminate into the mountain summit. A magnificent U-shaped valley stretched up to the spur of the other side of the mountain. Within it, a country surrounded by round, gray walls could be seen vaguely.
“The view sure is nice,” Hermes expressed his admiration.
“Yeah. But from here we can’t tell if the hearts of the people living there is just as beautiful.”
“Right. Well, let’s go. It may turn out to be very memorable; a country you wouldn’t forget for the rest of your life,” Hermes teased, and Kino smiled.
“That would be great.”
The motorrad descended the gentle slopes.


Right before the tightly shut gates, several soldiers carrying long, rifle-type persuaders (Note: A gun) were waiting for Kino and Hermes.
Kino muttered as she slowed down. “Let’s see if they’ll let us in easily.”
“What will you do if they don’t, Kino?”
Kino stopped in front of the gate. She cut the engine and dismounted Hermes. While taking off her goggles, Kino approached the guards, who were scrutinizing Kino and Hermes with stern expressions.
When Kino was about to say her greetings,
“How many days are you planning to spend here?” A brusque question suddenly came from one of the soldiers.
“Oh, just as the rumors say?” Hermes muttered out of earshot.
“Three days. That is, I would like to stay until the day after tomorrow.”
With Kino’s reply, the tension from the soldier’s faces disappeared, replaced by a calm smile. They looked at each other for a moment. Then they stood in attention and saluted to Kino and Hermes with flawless gestures.
The one who seemed to be their commanding officer spoke with utmost courtesy. “We welcome you to our country. Your visit greatly honors us.”
“……”
Kino was stunned for a moment, then took off her hat. “Good day. I am Kino, and this here is Hermes,” Kino greeted, and at last the soldiers lowered their hands.
“Miss Kino, Hermes, come this way please.”
The commanding officer guided Kino and Hermes not towards the guardroom, but to the gate. Kino, who was again taken by surprise, asked, “What about the immigration procedures? Like inspecting my things, or something?”
“It’s not necessary. We consider that very rude, and will only be done if you are actually suspected of a crime,” the officer said, still smiling. One of the soldiers entered the guardroom, and soon, the gate slowly rose. “Please go ahead. We have to stay outside the gates because of our duties. There should be someone waiting inside, so don’t hesitate to ask anything there.”
With the saluting soldiers behind, Kino pushed Hermes along and passed through the thick walls.
Hermes began, “That was a bit disappointing. Maybe we took a wrong turn somewhere?”
“Nope, that can’t be,” Kino denied. The inner gates began to open before their eyes.


Upon passing through the inner gates, Kino and Hermes came out to the town’s main street.
Right in front of the gates was a park where several people have gathered. When they saw Kino, they gave her a warm welcome and expressed their appreciation for her visit.
More and more people gathered as Kino replied to their greetings, and soon, Kino and Hermes became the center of a throng of people. All of them were smiling, uttering words of welcome simultaneously. As for people who glared, or throw stones, there were none.
With a repressed exclamation, Hermes spoke so that only Kino would hear. “We’ve come to a different country! I’m sure of it!”
“That can’t be… probably.” Kino paused, and addressed the crowd. “Thank you very much. I was not expecting such a big welcome, so I’m a bit surprised. But um… there’s something I would like to ask.”
Everybody hushed to catch what Kino was going to say. With a nervous tone, Kino asked whether they knew a hotel with a shower and space for Hermes inside; one that doesn’t charge so much.
The people began to argue among themselves as to which place would suit Kino’s criteria. At that moment, a girl’s voice was heard from the back of the assembly.
“Our place is like that!”
The crowd parted, and a girl quickly came up front. She was around eleven or twelve, with short hair and big eyes.
The people stopped arguing, and focused their attention on the girl. The girl gave a springy bow, and introduced herself to Kino. “Hello, miss traveler. I’m Sakura.”
“Hi there. I’m Kino, and this here is my partner, Hermes,” Kino replied with a smile, and Hermes greeted with a ‘hello’.
Sakura looked straight at Kino, clasped her hands in front of her, and asked, “My parents run a hotel just over there. I’m sure you’ll like it. What do you say?”
Kino was surprised, and her expression clouded for a moment. 
“Please be our guide.”  
“Yeah. We’ll leave it to you.”
Hearing Kino and Hermes’ replies, Sakura smiled and nodded energetically.
“Sure!”


With Sakura’s guidance, Kino walked, pushing Hermes beside her.
Along the way, she took off her jacket and hung it on Hermes’ carrier. Kino wore a black jacket fastened with a belt on the waist. On her right thigh was a holster containing the revolver-type hand persuader she called ‘Canon’.
“Say, Miss Kino,” Sakura looked up at Kino and began a conversation.
“Hm?”
“Isn’t the name ‘Kino’ wonderful? It’s short, sounds nice, and easy to pronounce.”
“Thanks. I also thought that way a long time ago.”
Kino’s reply made Sakura look puzzled. “A long time ago? What about now?”
Kino laughed and turned her gaze towards Sakura.
“I still think so. It’s a nice name after all. But ‘Sakura’ also sounds good, what does it mean?”
Sakura replied, looking embarrassed, “It’s the name of a flower that blooms in spring. It’s a pretty flower with a pink color.”
“Oh…” was Kino’s short response. This time, Sakura slightly pouted.
“But you know, my friends always make fun of me and call me names like ‘Nekura’ or ‘Okura’. It’s so annoying.”[2]
“……”
Kino fell silent and her eyes stared into space.
“What’s wrong, Kino?” Hermes asked, and Kino gave a quick reply.
“Nothing.” Then added, “It’s not something I can explain.”


Kino and Hermes soon arrived at the hotel.
It was not too big, but it was thoroughly clean inside and out.
The young couple at the front desk greeted Kino and Hermes. “Welcome. It’s really been a long time since we had visitors from outside the country.”
“These are my parents. They manage this hotel, and also serve as the tour guides for this area. And I am their apprentice,” Sakura said. Kino bowed with a smile and introduced Hermes.
“Let’s see, what room would you like?” As Sakura’s mother asked Kino, Sakura nimbly looked into the ledger and suggested, “Is that ground floor room with the wide door available?” Her mother nodded. “Then let’s give them that room so that Hermes can go in and out easily.”
Sakura led Kino and Hermes to the room. Just as she said, it has plenty of space for Hermes to go through, and convenient, for they need not change direction when going out, as it has another door that they could use. When Sakura asked about her impression of the room, Kino replied that it was more than satisfactory.
“It’s almost lunch, so please go to the dining hall. It’s at the right side of the front desk, a door with a big berry drawn on it.”
“Thank you. I’ll follow right away.”
After Sakura left, Hermes spoke to Kino who was taking down the luggage from the carrier. “It’s very different from the rumors.”
“You bet. I was surprised, too.”
Hermes dropped his tone a little, and spoke seriously. “Say, Kino. What if after this good service, their treatment suddenly becomes completely the opposite. With that gap, the traveler will hit rock bottom out of frustration.""
“I wonder if they would make such an elaborate scheme…. Well, that’s fine. I’ll go eat lunch. After that, let’s go around the town. Maybe it’s just as you say, Hermes,” Kino said with a wry smile, and left the room.


After a delicious lunch, Sakura offered her services as a tour guide for free, which Kino accepted appreciatively.
Kino removed the boxes on either side of Hermes’ rear wheel. Then she asked Sakura for a cushion and laid it out on top of the carrier rack to make an instant back seat.
Sakura sat on the back seat sideways. Kino told her to tightly hold on to her waist while they ride, but warned her not to touch Canon on her right thigh.
Kino first asked Sakura to take them to a place where a mechanic could do a check-up on Hermes.
The middle-aged mechanic accepted Kino’s request right away. He checked Hermes from tip to toe, and soon located the parts that were heavily worn-out, damaged, or in bad condition.
“Hmm? What happened here?” The mechanic asked Kino about the cracked nut beside Hermes’ engine.
In fear of Kino dodging the question out of embarrassment, Hermes spoke in her stead. “Kino fired at it with her persuader. Because it wouldn’t come off.”
“Fired?”
“The nut got stuck and wouldn’t come off no matter what she did, so using her persuader with reduced gunpowder, Kino fired at the edge of the hardened putty holding the nut in place. I told her to leave it alone though.”
The appalled mechanic turned to Kino and gave her a sour look. “Miss traveler… that’s some heroic effort, but I can’t praise you for it.”
“I suppose you’re right… I’m sorry,” Kino apologized.
“Mister, scold her a bit more,” Hermes said half-jokingly.
Soon the mechanic smiled with his oil-smeared face. “It seems like it will take some time to fix him. Miss traveler, please have some tea with Sakura while waiting. Now, shall we go Hermes?”
“I’ll leave it to you!” Hermes readily consented as though nothing could make him happier.


Kino and Sakura drank their tea while seated on a bench in front of the mechanic’s shop. The warm sun in the clear sky watched over them.
“He must be a skilled mechanic. It’s rare for Hermes to happily agree to get fixed, you know.”
Hearing Kino’s comment, Sakura, who was seated beside her, looked up at her and replied with delight, “I’m glad.”
Kino added, “And he had no qualms about scolding his client, either.” Sakura giggled.
“The tea’s delicious too.” As Kino remarked, a car passed in front, and through the window, a resident smiled and waved to her.
“Miss traveler, welcome to our country!”


On the second morning, Kino woke up at dawn.
Kino left the soundly sleeping Hermes, who was fixed until he’s good as new, inside the room. She went out of the hotel and went into a small public park nearby. There were no clouds in the clear sky. The peak of the towering mountain on the northern side of the town could be seen very well.
Kino performed her usual workout, from simple exercises to her combat skills. Afterwards, she practiced her quick draw with an unloaded Canon.
As Kino was wiping off her sweat, a man who was jogging approached her. He greeted Kino with a smile, and Kino greeted back. The man asked Kino of her impressions of the country.
Kino truthfully answered that it was completely different from the rumors she had heard. The man smiled bitterly upon hearing her answer, “Is that so? It was really terrible in the past, you see.”
The man pointed at Canon and asked if she had it repaired recently. When Kino shook her head, the man told her about a skilled persuader smith at the southern part of the town, and that it would be great if she could check it out. Then he drew a simple map on the ground.
When Kino thanked him,
“As compared to you dropping by our country, it’s not a big deal at all,” the man said and left with a wave of the hand and a smile.


“The persuader smith at the southern district? Okay. You know, the park at the southern district is beautiful.”
After breakfast, Kino asked Sakura to be her guide once more, and Sakura readily agreed. When Kino thanked her, Sakura proudly declared,
“It’s the job of a tour guide to make sure that the guests are satisfied.”


Just as the day before, the two rode Hermes and headed for the tiny store near the southern walls. With a loud voice, Sakura asked if there was anybody home. After a while, a grumpy-looking old man came out from the interior of the shop.
“I’m closed today… no, I’m closed tomorrow, too. Come back the day after tomorrow.” The persuader smith, who seemed to have been disturbed in the middle of his sleep, said coldly.
“This is Miss Kino. She’s a traveler. She’s going to stay until tomorrow only, so can you please fix her persuader?” Sakura said.
The persuader smith was surprised. “A traveler?”
Sakura nodded. The persuader smith glanced at Kino and asked curtly, “Where is it?”
Kino took out Canon from its holster with a complicated expression. The persuader smith lightly waved his fingers for Kino to hand it over. When he held it, he stared at it with a sharp expression for a while, and muttered,
“…Oh, I see. Let me tinker with this thing, will you?”
The persuader smith demanded Kino to hand over its accessories. Kino thanked him and passed him Canon’s empty cylinders and spare parts.
“The gutter have seen much use, so I’ll have to check the frame. I may have to change parts so it will take a while. Around afternoon, I guess. It’s a good idea to go to the public park for a while. There’s a festival there right now.”
As the persuader smith spoke, he gently took one of the persuaders hanging from the wall. He handed a .45 caliber double-action revolver with a semi-circular clip, as well as several bullets, to Kino.
“This is a replacement. You will have no need for it in this country, but it can serve as a weight. Wear this for a while.”


The traveler, motorrad, and girl left the store expressing their gratitude. The old man glimpsed at the hand persuader passed to him. In the empty store, he muttered,
“What a surprise… You’ve lived a long life.”[3]


There was a large park in a place not too far away from the shop. Inside, there was a forest with a variety of trees left as they were, as well as a beautiful swamp and pond. There were several simple houses made from wood, where children played.
One corner of the park was made into an open-air theater where a lot of people have gathered.
A play was being held in the theater when Kino, Hermes, and Sakura arrived. Sakura explained that the townspeople performed in this play to teach the children the history of their country.
When Kino said that she has great interest in history, Sakura invited her to watch.
Two humans and one motorrad made their way to the end of the line. When the person before them recognized Kino as the traveler, he offered to vacate his position to let them get ahead. The next person also turned over his position, and the next one also gave up his seat with a smile. After thanking one person after another, Kino, Hermes, and Sakura eventually ended up in a guest seat where they can view the play best.
Kino took the seat somewhat apologetically and propped Hermes on his stand. The play has already started. When Kino was about to catch up to the story, the narrator at the side of the stage suddenly exclaimed.
“W-wait a moment! …Oh, sorry. But hold it! You seated over there, could you be the traveler that arrived yesterday?”
The people on stage and the audience looked at Kino all at once. Sakura stood up and replied, “That’s right! She decided just now that she wanted to see the play! I’m her guide.”
The surrounding adults cheered and clapped their hands for some reason. Even the actors on the stage clapped their hands and hooted. The narrator continued, “Everyone! Since we just started the play, what about doing it from the top for the sake of miss traveler over here? She won’t have a chance to see it again.”
Around the dazed Kino and Hermes, the people could be heard saying things like, ‘No complaints!’ or ‘That’s a good idea!’, and broke into applause once again. A young woman stood up, “Please watch out for my boy’s acting this time, okay?! He’s the third tree from the left side!” She shouted loudly, prompting everyone to laugh.
Kino stood up, looked all around her and bowed.
“All right! It’s decided then!”
The narrator declared, and the actors started their preparations. Kino sat on the bench with a flop. “I was so surprised,” she said as she looked at Sakura.
“Same here,” Hermes said.
“Welcome to our country!” Sakura said as the play began.


The play explained the history of this country.
A long, long time ago, a group of people was persecuted and chased out of a distant country. They visited many different countries, but couldn’t find a place that would accept them.
After wandering for a long time, they got lost deep inside a forest.
But the blessings of the forest saved the lives of the starving people. They decided to create a new country in this forest, where no one would hate them.
And time passed by like a flowing river.
“And now, here I am.  At the head of that current,” Sakura said in a whisper, amidst the applause of the crowd.


“Miss traveler, please join us for lunch.”
Kino was overwhelmed with numerous requests like this. In the end, they joined the members of the play in its closing party.
At the barbecue stand in the park, Kino asked if there was anything she could help with, and was given the role of starting the fire. After Kino handled the job in no time, she was then given the task of grilling. After awkwardly wearing the apron handed to her, she skillfully grilled dozens of skewered meat.
Hermes muttered while looking at Kino doing these things. “She actually looks like she’s having fun.”
After the party, Kino looked back at the park one more time, and returned to the persuader smith’s shop.


“It’s done.”
The persuader smith lifted his face and stood up from his chair. He took the cloth-covered Canon placed on top of his work table.  He looked at Kino with his creased, blue eyes. Then he handed it, still covered, to Kino, grip first.
“It’s a very good persuader. You should treasure it.”
“Thank you very much.”
Kino took it, and to check if it’s working well, she raised the hammer and pulled the trigger several times. Her expression changed.
“I’m surprised…. It’s better than the first time I held it.”
“Is that so,” was the persuader smith’s blunt reply.
“Thank you very much. How much do I owe you?”
“I don’t need any.”
“Huh?”
The persuader smith sat down, looked up at Kino, and asked, “You’re good at persuaders aren’t you, miss traveler?”
“Yeah, I guess.”
“There’s something I would like to ask you…”
“Yes?”
“Once there was a remarkable persuader marksman who made her students call her ‘Master’. She was a traveler who would stick her neck into all kinds of trouble. Her skill stood out too much, and various countries would despise, and sometimes thank her for it. …That was a long time ago. If she’s still alive now, she would be quite old.”
“……”
“Miss traveler, do you know of such a person?”
Kino looked at Canon once and put it back to its holster. Then she looked straight at the persuader smith.
“No, I don’t.”
The persuader smith slowly smiled. “I see. Thank you. I don’t need any payment. Moreover…”
He turned his chair around, grabbed a wooden box and held it out to Kino. “I want you to look at this.”
“?”
Upon taking it, Kino opened the box and saw a hand persuader inside.
It was a slim, .22 caliber automatic with a square barrel that has a weight attached underneath.
It was made for a left-handed person, as its safety, slide stop, and magazine catch were all on the right side. Inside the box, there were reserve magazines and parts, a harmonica-shaped silencer and the silencer’s slide lock, a special cleaning kit, holster, and other things.
“What a nice persuader. It’s the first time I’ve seen this type,” Kino said, and the persuader smith nodded.
“It’s called ‘Woodsman’. It’s a .22 caliber model.”
“Oh. It’s such a valuable item.” Kino expressed her admiration and was about to return the box when the persuader smith spoke,
“I want you to use it. Take it.” Kino lifted her face in surprise. The old man explained gently, “A long time ago, when I was still a traveler, this was always on my hip. It protected my life time and again. But I haven’t used it for decades now. I’m already old, and I could no longer travel… but this persuader still has a long way to go. It would be a pity to let it rot along with my body. I want it to go on a journey like before.”
“Is that so… but…”
“Please take it.”
“Um…”
“You’ll take it, won’t you?”
“…But I…”
“You’ll have to take it.”
“……. I understand. I’ll treasure it.”
Upon hearing this, a smile appeared on the persuader smith’s face. It was as if he won the lottery. He suddenly stood up and exclaimed, “Yes! I knew it! Come here! I’ll teach you how to use it. I’ll let you tinker with the holster and the grip too. Come!” 
And then the old man, who did not seem like one at all, almost forcibly dragged Kino to an indoor shooting range.
At the store front, Sakura and Hermes were left alone, dumbfounded.


“I’ll have to tell them that we’ll be home late.”
Sakura said and went to a nearby store to borrow a telephone. Kino and Hermes waited at one corner of the street. It has become dark, and the people on the street have thinned down.

“I didn’t think he would let me fire like that,” Kino muttered, holding a bag with a wooden box inside.
The persuader smith did not let Kino go until she fired three hundred rounds. During that time, he remodeled the holster so that it could be worn in the belt at the back. And at last, he sent off Kino, Sakura and Hermes out of the store with a satisfied look.
“Isn’t that great? I had nothing but free time after all,” Hermes snapped back.
“Well, sorry for keeping you waiting. But this time, it’s not my fault.”
“Hmph.”
Kino lightly lifted the bag. “What will I do with this?”
“Aren’t you gonna use it? After all that trouble.”
“Simple to say. I wonder what Master would tell me if she sees me wearing a .22 caliber automatic?”
“She won’t say anything. She’ll shoot at you.”
“……”
“If she sees you. It’s okay as long as she doesn’t,” Hermes said without a care. 
“You know, I always have this feeling that she would see me,” Kino said.
“My condolences, then… By the way, why did you tell him you didn’t know about Master?” Hermes asked.
Kino answered honestly, “Master told me to answer that way in case someone asked about her…”
“Oh I see. It’s for your protection,” Hermes said in admiration. Kino mused to no one in particular,
“I wonder what that person did in the past?”


Sakura came back.
“Miss Kino, I told my mom we’ll be late for dinner.”
“Thanks. Then, shall we go home?”
As Kino was about to start Hermes’ engine, “Wait,” Sakura interrupted, “Miss Kino, Hermes. Before we go home, there’s a place I would like to take you to. I won’t have any other chance. Is that okay?”
“Yes, I don’t mind. What about you Hermes?”
“It’s fine. What kind of place?”
“It’s a very wonderful place!” was Sakura’s only answer.


“Amazing.”
“Pretty!”
Upon opening the door, Kino and Hermes exclaimed in admiration at the same time. Kino, Hermes and Sakura stood at the topmost part of the wall. Sakura guided them to the workers’ cabin beneath the walls, and rode the cargo elevator.
It was deep red.
The sun that has just set dyed the sky a deep red. It was a strong hue, almost transparent.
From afar, the line of peaks could be seen clearly. The sky began beyond it.
“This is my favorite place. I believe it’s the most wonderful place in the world. Someday, if customers come, I will definitely guide them here. You are the first ones.”
“It’s an honor,” Kino said as she kicked down Hermes’ stand.
For a while, the two people and motorrad remained standing, gazing at the red sky.  
Then Sakura broke the silence. “I want to follow my father and mother’s footsteps, and become a great hotel manager and tour guide…. I wonder if I’ll become one?”
“You will. No, you already are a wonderful tour guide. I’ve had lots of fun these two days,” Kino said with a smile.
“I agree. A wonderful country like this deserves a wonderful tour guide like you,” Hermes slightly put on airs. Sakura was a bit surprised, and replied awkwardly,
“Ehehe. Thank you, Miss Kino, Hermes.”
Kino sat on the walls and looked up at Sakura.
Sakura remained standing facing the evening sun, and told them, “I want to learn more, and become a wonderful tour guide. I want more and more travelers to come to this country where I was born, and create wonderful memories together for them to take home.” Then the girl looked at Kino with a carefree smile, “Isn’t it wonderful to be able to do that?”
Without removing her gaze from Sakura, Kino smiled and nodded several times. “Yeah. It’s such a wonderful job.”
Then she set her eyes on the red sky once more.


They returned to the hotel, and Kino ate dinner with Sakura. Hermes was in the room, asleep. After the delicious meal, Sakura’s mother came with tea and cakes. When she asked if Sakura had been a trouble for them,
“Not at all. On the contrary, we had so much fun.” Sakura smiled a bit proudly, and asked Kino,
“Say Miss Kino. Do you have painful or hard times during your travels?”
Kino nodded, “There are, once in a while.”
“Did you ever want to quit?” Sakura fixed her gaze at Kino, who was drinking her tea.
“Nope, I would still continue.”
“Is that because you believe it is something you have to do?”
Kino shook her head to Sakura’s question, and answered, “It’s because it’s what I want to do.”
With a satisfied smile, Sakura lifted her mug to her lips. After two gulps, she changed the topic by asking, “Miss Kino. During your travels, haven’t you met a wonderful person, the person who is destined for you?”
Kino was slightly taken aback, and with a sour face, “Nope, too bad. However, there were a lot who ran away after seeing my persuader.”
The two laughed. Soon Sakura’s parents came, having finished their work. They sat beside Sakura. Her mother suggested, “Sakura, you can go on a journey if you like.”
“Eh?” Sakura, surprised, looked at her parents’ face.
“Just like Miss Kino, you could go around places, see different things, and study. After that, you can become a tour guide here. When we saw Kino, we thought learning that way isn’t a bad idea.”
“Really…?”
“What do you think?”
Sakura was slightly troubled for a while, but soon shook her head and smiled. “No. I’m not going anywhere. I will study here, and become the number one tour guide here. That is my dream! Besides, I already have wonderful teachers here, right? Father, Mother.”
The two looked at each other. “I see… That’s good too. In a while, you will surpass us and we will be left with nothing to do, huh?” The mother asked, and her daughter quickly replied.
“You bet!”
And the family laughed in joy.
Kino gazed at them, as if she was witnessing something from a different world.


The next day, that is, the morning of the third day since Kino entered the country. Kino did not wake up with the dawn like usual.
The sun was already high in the sky when Hermes woke up on his own, and was quite surprised upon finding Kino still in bed. He then let out a loud voice and Kino woke up.
Kino quickly jumped up from the bed. She looked at the sun out of the window, shock painted all over her face.
“What’s wrong, Kino?” Hermes asked, but with an expression saying that she herself doesn’t know, Kino muttered,
“Strange… Maybe there’s something wrong with my body today?”


“Miss Kino, there’s a wedding nearby, do you want to watch?”
After eating her late breakfast, Sakura came to take the dishes away and asked.
Kino readily agreed, and returned to the room to take Hermes along. Together with Sakura, they headed to a nearby church-like building. Since it was not too far, she just pushed Hermes.
Beyond the crowd, the bride and groom stood, wearing clothing with muted colors.
They were young. Both looked only in their late teens.
“They sure get married young,” Hermes noted.
“Normally, people get married after they’re twenty. It’s strange,” Sakura answered.
The couple raised up a big bag onto a platform. The female guests rushed up in front. Sakura explained quickly.
“Together, they will throw lots of small bags to the guests. Mixed among those bags are a few containing a single tree seed. The number of bags containing tree seeds is the same as the number of children the couple wanted to have. A legend goes that a person who greets the next morning with those seeds in her hands will become the next happy bride.” While explaining, Sakura also looked like she wanted to participate. Kino noticed, and offered,
“Then let me also look for them. Two heads are better than one.”
Sakura asked in surprise. “Is that okay?”
“It’s all right. Let’s go.”
The two joined in with the crowd of women.
“Hmph.” When the neglected Hermes grumbled to himself, the couple shouted out,
“We would like to have five children!”
Then together, they started to distribute the small bags. They threw one after the other, and the female guests frantically gathered the falling bags. They opened them, and when they found out that it was not the one they were looking for, they threw them near the other guests.
As Sakura searched just as desperately, Kino took her hand and pulled her out of the crowd.
“Here.” Inside the bag Kino held out to her was a single big seed.
“Wow! …But how did you find one so easily?” Sakura asked in amazement.
“I’ve always been lucky,” Kino said coolly.
“…Can I really have it?” Sakura asked to confirm, and Kino answered.
“Of course. It may not be enough to thank you for being our guide.”
Sakura shook her head. “That’s not true! I’ve never had one until now. I’ve always wanted it. Thank you very much, Miss Kino!”
“You’re welcome.”
Kino said to Sakura, who was embracing the bag affectionately.


When they returned to the hotel, several unarmed soldiers were standing in front of it. They looked at Kino, and saluted when they arrived.
“Miss traveler, it’s time for you to prepare for your departure,” one of them instructed.
Kino considered for a while, and asked casually, “Um, can’t I stay for one or two more days?”
Sakura looked up at Kino’s face in shock, and Hermes asked loudly, “Wha-! K-Kino, what’s wrong with you?!”
“Nothing… You don’t have to act that surprised.”
Without changing their stiff countenance, “…I’m sorry, but when you came in, you declared only three days. It’s a rule…. Please make your preparations immediately.”


Kino reluctantly began her preparations.
She refilled fuel nearby, and bought portable rations. The shopkeeper was a middle-aged lady with a stern expression, but when she asked for the price of the items, her answer each time was, “It’s free.”
“Is that all right?” Kino asked in disbelief.
“Of course. Because you’re a traveler, overcharging is a problem. In exchange, please tell other travelers about this store. Tell them to shop here. If they buy in other places, they’ll get bad luck,” the woman said and gave a not-so-charming wink.
Kino and Hermes returned to the hotel, and quickly arranged their luggage. Sakura, her parents, and the aforementioned soldiers were all waiting for her at the front desk.
“If you’re going to camp out on the western side, you should go to that mountain spur. Before that, there is a danger of falling rocks. Moreover, the road afterwards will be downhill,” Sakura’s father described. “Indeed, that’s a good place. There’s also a small swamp nearby, and the scenery is fabulous,” the soldiers added, and drew her a simple map. 
“Here take this.” Sakura handed Kino two bundles. Sakura’s mother explained, “It’s our country’s traditional picnic food. Sakura helped me make it. You can eat the small package in the evening, and this one in the morning. It will hold out for a day.”
Kino received the bundles, and faced all of the people gathered there.
“I’m truly grateful for everything.” Then she held out her hand to Sakura and gripped the tiny hand, “Thank you. I’ve really had wonderful memories here.”
Sakura squeezed the hand tightly,
“You’re welcome.”


Kino, who was now wearing her coat, and the luggage-laden Hermes, were in the plaza in front of the western gates. A large crowd has gathered in it, this time to bid farewell to the traveler.
For the last time, Kino faced the residents. “Everyone, thank you very much. I have been to many different places, but this is the first time I have received so much kindness.”
Everyone there smiled, and clapped their hands on impulse.
Sakura squeezed her small body in front of the crowd and gave a springy bow. “Miss Kino, Hermes. Thank you very much for staying with us. Next time you visit, please come together with a nice person for your honeymoon. I’ll reserve the best room for you,” Sakura offered like a brilliant hotel manager.
Kino smiled. “Sure. See you again someday.”
The crowd’s cheers gushed forth.
“See you again someday!” Sakura said as she waved her little hand, and Kino returned a smile.
Then Kino pushed Hermes out of the inner gates. She didn’t look back even once.
When she has passed through the outer gates, Kino started Hermes’ engine. The soldiers sent her off. 
“Please be careful,” the soldiers said. Kino faced them, took off her hat, and bowed. After she was saluted, she launched Hermes off.
The soldiers did not loosen their stances until the motorrad was out of sight.


“Kino? That’s rare of you to want to stay for more than three days.”
Hermes talked to Kino as they rode through the forest.
“Yeah, I was surprised with myself too,” Kino said and dropped the gear. Then she continued. “But this may be for the best. If I had stayed any longer, I may have wanted to stay some more, and eventually, I wouldn’t be able to will myself to leave.”
“…You’re really saying some strange things today. Oh, right, haven’t you heard? It may be an omen for a calamity.”
“How rude,” Kino said with a light laugh. 
Hermes turned solemn. “It’s a great country, isn’t it?”
Kino nodded. “It was really fun.”
They ran for a while, and Hermes spoke as if he recalled something. “It was totally different from the rumors.”
“Yeah.”
“I wonder why?” Hermes asked.
“Who knows. I was worried about it at first, but I stopped caring along the way,” Kino said, and a satisfied smile appeared beneath her goggles. Then she continued.
“If other travelers ask me what kind of place it is, I will tell them that it is a very welcoming and kind country.”


They rode until it was evening, and arrived at a mountain spur. It was the place Sakura’s father and the soldiers were referring to. Kino decided to camp out there.
She passed over a rope between Hermes and a tree, and stretched a tarp above it to protect against the rain. She spread out a blanket and placed her sleeping bag under it.
She opened the small package Sakura gave her. Inside it was a well-roasted wild bird. Kino ate it all up.
She boiled water drawn from the swamp and made tea. While holding her cup, Kino looked at the eastern scenery.
The moon gradually ascended from the ridges of the mountain, dimly illuminating the forest. Several clusters of artificial lights could be seen from afar. It was Sakura’s country.
Kino lightly lifted her cup to a toast.
After finishing her tea, Kino entrusted the watch to Hermes. Then she crawled in the sleeping bag with her jacket and boots still on.


When the full moon has reached its highest,
Kino stirred from inside the sleeping bag, and quickly rose up. Hermes asked, “Kino? What’s wrong? There’s nothing suspicious. There are no animals nearby. The weather also seems nice.”
“I couldn’t sleep…” Kino crawled out of the sleeping bag and stood beside Hermes.
“Is it because you woke up late today?”
“No, that’s not it.” Kino asserted, her expression stiffening.
“I have a bad feeling…. I have this strange, grating sensation.”
Kino slowly extracted Canon from its holster. Hermes looked on nervously, “W-what?” he asked. Kino did not answer, and looked alertly around her. Hermes also surveyed the surroundings for some reason.
The sky’s light purple gradated to a white towards the moon. From afar, the silhouette of the lined-up black peaks could be clearly seen. The tiny clusters of light at the ground were from some people in Sakura’s country who were staying up late.
Kino’s expression was like that of a novice soldier about to ambush the enemy.
“There’s nothing. Don’t worry too much.” Just as he tried to appease Kino, the ground began to shake weakly. A low rumbling sound echoed.
A dark mass rose up from the towering mountain on the northern side. It was like a gigantic cumulo-nimbus cloud in mid-summer, slowly swelling out.  Except that under the moonlight, it had a thick gray hue, and it was born from the mountain.
When it has swelled to its maximum size, the edge began to crumble and roll. While the low rumbles resounded, it lapped up the slope downwards with an intense speed. From Kino’s point of view, it was from left to right.
The molten mass eventually engulfed the tiny lights.
“What…? What is that?!” Kino shouted, pointing Canon’s barrel towards it. Hermes explained absent-mindedly,
“If my memory serves me right, it’s a volcanic eruption.”
“A what?” Kino turned around and asked. Hermes spoke with a tone of a professor,
“Volcanic ash and pumice stone spouted out at high temperatures, flowing down a mountain surface at high speeds. A pyrotechnic show.”[4]
“…You mean a pyroclastic flow?!” 
“Yeah, that’s it!” Hermes said and fell silent.
The pyroclastic flow surged towards the valley. Kino spoke as she looked at the vanishing lights. “If I go there now, will I be able to do anything?”
“No,” Hermes answered in a flash.
“……”
“The temperature of that flow is nearly a thousand degrees Celsius. A person would die before he knows it. The blood in their whole bodies would boil, and they will die from shock. Everyone’s dead. No one had time to escape. Even if you go there, there’s nothing you could do, Kino. You will just die,” Hermes calmly explained to the dumbfounded Kino.
“……” 
Amidst the low rumbles, Kino flopped down right where she stood.


After some time, the surroundings became quiet, and later, the view to the valley became clearer. The moon has inclined to the west, and the sky to the east became paler. Kino had been sitting and gripping Canon in her right hand the whole time. Kino did not say anything, and Hermes did not ask anything.


When the night has fully subsided, the sky and the mosaic-colored forest returned to view. However, the country within the valley was now covered by a single ashen color.
Kino stood up. She returned Canon to its holster.
She mutely folded the tarp and collected the blanket and sleeping bag. She took out the big bundle inside the bag.
“Once I finish eating… let’s leave,” Kino said as she sat down near Hermes and opened the bundle. Inside was hard-baked bread and salted meat.
Kino ate everything in silence. Then as she was about to fold the bundle, she noticed a letter and a small package inside.
Kino took out the letter. The address and the sender’s name was written.
“…It’s a letter for us. From Sakura’s mother.”
“Read it,” Hermes urged.
Under the sky that has brightened up considerably, Kino began to read the letter.


To Kino and Hermes. To the last travelers to visit our country.

By the time you read this letter, we probably are no longer in this world. Our country and our scorched bodies must already be buried underneath ashes. And perhaps you have witnessed it yourselves.
It has been exactly one month since we learned of that mountain’s imminent eruption. From our scientists’ investigation, we knew that a large-scale pyroclastic flow would raze our country. We were left with two choices: to stay or to abandon our homes.
We have made our decision. We chose to stay.
This may seem foolish to a traveler like you. But we were born and raised here. We know nothing of other places or ways of living. Perhaps we were not given a choice in the first place. Even so, we do not bemoan our fate. After that decision, we felt somewhat relieved. We decided to live our remaining days as best as we can. Without cursing our destiny, or feeling hate and sadness, we spent every day to the fullest.
At that moment, we were overcome with surprise. By the time we disappear from this world, there is not a single outsider, that is, a traveler, who would remember us. I’m not sure if you are aware of it, but in the past, our country had acted impudently towards travelers, knowing full well that they were offended by it. We realized that the only memories that will remain of our country, is that of its rude inhabitants.
We vowed since then that if someone visited our country, we will give a heartfelt welcome. We want to leave that person with wonderful memories of our country and its people.
Ironically, no traveler came just when we have decided to change. Perhaps we were cursed by the bad reputation we have built for ourselves. Time silently flowed by. We were about to give up. But when there were only three days left, you came.
In behalf of our country, I receive you with all my heart.
Miss Kino, Hermes. Welcome.

P.S.
I was conflicted on whether I should write to you or not. But I want to tell you about this.
We made this fact known only to adults, to people over twelve years of age. On the day after the eruption, that is, by the time you read this letter, it is Sakura’s twelfth birthday.
Miss Kino. When I saw you getting along well with her, we thought we could entrust her to you, even though it’s painful for us. But last night, that child declared that she wanted to follow our footsteps and become a tour guide in this country. Since that is her dream, we decided to take her along with us, selfish though it may be.
Thank you for reading until the end.


“I see. Now everything makes sense,” Hermes said.
Kino contemplated for a while, letter in hand.
Eventually, with a low, almost moaning tone, she muttered. 
“Ego… This is ego.”
Hermes spoke softly. “That may be true. But there’s nothing you could do about it anymore. Either way, it’s impossible to travel with two people on board.”
Kino folded the letter and returned it to the envelope.
She took the other, smaller package. Inside was a folded piece of paper and a small bag. For a moment, she thought it resembled the bag she gave to Sakura. When she opened it, the seed was indeed inside.
Kino hurriedly opened the paper and read what was written in it.
“‘Miss Kino. There is no…’”
Kino stopped. Her eyes opened wide and she stiffened. Hermes urged her to read the rest.


Miss Kino
There is no reason for me to hold on to this. It is yours.
Please take care. And please do not forget about us.
Sakura


Kino took a long breath and looked up to the heavens.
She stayed like this for a while.


Eventually, Kino slowly and carefully put away the letter and the bag inside her luggage.
At the same time, Kino took the box she received from the persuader smith. She attached the holster to the belt behind her waist.
She filled the magazines with small bullets. She put some inside her pouch, and one inside Woodsman. She loaded it and locked the safety, then installed it in the holster.
The Woodsman adorned Kino’s back with its barrel inserted in the holster, looking almost bare in a glance.
“Looks great on you,” Hermes said. Kino said nothing, but smiled a little.
Kino strapped the luggage on top of Hermes. When she started Hermes engine, its well-regulated roar resounded through the forest.
Kino wore her coat, put on her hat, and hung her goggles by her neck. The sun was slowly beginning to show itself. It shone vividly on the mix of green, red and yellow. Kino squinted and put her goggles over her eyes. The lens reflected the light, hiding Kino’s expression.
“It’s a great country, isn’t it?”
“Yeah. It was so much fun. …I have no complaints whatsoever.”
Kino straddled Hermes and, “Shall we go?”
“Sure.”
Kino looked back just once, gazing at the gently sloping valley painted with gray. She looked at the country buried underneath the ashes.
Then she looked ahead.
Eventually the motorrad rode away, leaving the place in silence.














"
30,v4c4,4,4,"“A citizen card? But I’m not a resident of this country.”
“……? Oh, you’re a traveler? You must be the one who came riding a motorrad this morning.”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“But you didn’t bring a book with you.”
“Excuse me?”
“Ah no, never mind, I’m sorry…. Well, do you want to borrow a book here?”
“Yes… can I?”
“Let’s see… your name is?”
“Kino.”
“Miss Kino, where are you staying right now?”
“A hotel around that corner. As for the name… I’m sorry, I forgot. It’s the one with the blue roof.”
“That’s fine, I understand. How long are you planning to stay in this country?”
“The day after tomorrow. I’ll return the books by tomorrow.”
“If that’s the case, then it should be fine. I’ll make you a borrowing card, so please put your name and signature over here. You don’t have to fill in the address and social security number.”
“Yes. ……. Here it is.”
“Thank you very much. I’ll input this in our records, so please wait for a while.”
“Sure, thanks.”
“……. By the way, if you don’t mind telling me, what are your impressions about our country so far, Miss Kino?”
“…Books. I was really surprised with the amount of books here.”
“Isn’t it?! In our country, there is nothing more popular than reading books.  The people in this country read all the time except when they’re sleeping. I don’t know about other countries, but I believe our country won’t lose in terms of the number of libraries and bookstores.”
“That may be true. At least among all of the countries I’ve seen up to now, only this country has lots of impressive libraries in each and every corner.”
“By all means, indulge yourself with reading during your stay. There’s nothing more enriching than reading books. …Here is your card. Tomorrow we’ll be open from five in the morning until midnight. If you can’t return it by then, just drop it in the return box by the entrance.”
“Got it. Thank you very much——”


“Hermes! Are you awake?”
“*Mumbles*”
“Hermes?”
“Ah, you want to send a telegram? Roger.”
“…Wha—? You’re still half-asleep. He—llo?”
“Ah? Uh… oh, it’s just Kino.”
“Let’s return to the hotel, Hermes. It’s going to be dark soon.”
“It’s that time already…? By the way, what was that heavy stuff you loaded on me just now? Did you buy some explosives?”
“It’s just the books that I borrowed.”
“Huh?”
“I’ll take them to the hotel room and read before I sleep.”
“You’re going to read again? Kino, weren’t you in the library since morning?”
“Well, it’s not a bad idea to do this from time to time. And now that I feel like it, maybe I’m going to do the same tomorrow too.”
“……”
“Why not come with me, Hermes? Let’s go library-hopping.”
“…Motorrads were not meant to fly, nor read books. Not that I’m jealous. Hmph——”


“Good morning, Kino. I woke up the same time you did. On the dot. I was quite surprised at myself.”
“Good morning, Hermes.  You waking up the same time as me… that’s rare.”
“Well, it’s only because I had a good afternoon sleep yesterday. I didn’t have to sleep that much last night. I’ll probably be able to sleep this afternoon too.”
“I see… Say, Hermes. Was I saying anything while I was asleep? I had a weird dream.”
“Ooh, it’s rare for you to have a dream, Kino. What sort of dream? Tell me before you forget about it. You weren’t talking in your sleep.”
“Well, it’s like this… I was lost in a dark yet somewhat bright place, but for some reason, it’s very familiar. I couldn’t tell whether it’s in the past or future. I don’t know why, but I was being chased by a white wolf. Apparently, a person who looks like me stole something valuable. There was a red-eyed witch by my side, always attending to me, healing my wounds and singing a relaxing lullaby from time to time.”
“……”
“After a while, I found myself drinking tea leisurely with that witch. Then, we had a quiet walk in the middle of a snowy plain. However, a child came out saying some naughty things and the witch dragged him off. The child died. The next day, the witch’s head was gone, and I was sad. And then, the white wolf transformed into a gorgeous woman. She told me to come with her. And I came along without thinking.”
“……. Kino, what sort of weird books were you reading yesterday?”


“——Miss traveler, how was it?”
“Hmm? What do you mean?”
“About that book you returned in that wagon.  You’ve read all of it, haven’t you?”
“Ah, yes…. It was interesting.”
“What else?”
“What else?”
“Yes. There must be something else you can say. For instance, as to whether it was nicely written or if the feelings of the characters were portrayed well. I would really like to know what a traveler thinks about it. You must have a different point of view from a person who was born in and grew up here.”
“Even if you say that… it’s hard to give an opinion right off the bat.”
“I see… As for me, I would give that book 69 points. Of course, the perfect score is 100.”
“Uh… huh…”
“The main character was well-written. However, the influence of the supporting characters to the protagonist was quite weak. If only it cleared that criterion, I would have given it a higher score.”
“So it’s like that, huh…”
“This author is very thorough when it comes to describing action scenes. I could almost hear the main character’s kick cutting through the air. That aspect was very well done. On the other hand, his descriptions of nature are always vague; phrases like ‘blue sky, flowing clouds’ were used thirteen times in the first half of the story. It makes the reader lose interest.”
“……”
“Wait a minute! What are you saying? That was the author’s distinctive style. He probably thinks that his work doesn’t need superfluous descriptions.  You haven’t analyzed his style well enough.”
“Oh? Well, how would you assess his work then?”
“I give it 92 points! Without a doubt, it was this author’s greatest piece of work.”
“Really now? You must have a good reason to say that with so much confidence.”
“U-uhmm…”
“Why, of course! You noticed it yourself, haven’t you? The abundant presence of action scenes. But that’s not all. This author’s depiction of the protagonist’s grief about being obligated to fight for his life was really good.”
“Oh! You sure paid attention to that point.”
“…Uhm, it’s about time for me to be on my way, if you’ll excuse me…”
“Naturally! That point will not be put there by the author directly. If he were to say it explicitly, the reader, captivated merely by the action, will not care to think about anything else. The stuff you said about nature descriptions, etc. is correct. I agree with you. However, how much help would including descriptions like those in ‘Let’s Meet at Roult River’[2] do?” 
“Uh-huh. But wasn’t there a need to tone down the tempo? ‘Roll River’ was a cool choice, though.”
“I’ll be… going.”
“Did you know? The author lost his father and uncle in a war when he was just a child. In ‘Bobby and Lemons’, he assimilated those feelings into the main character. In ‘Brau Frau Brau’, killing to survive combined with the idea of a female boxer was pretty disconcerting. The cold-hearted presentation of the nature of being caught up in a fight was an indication of the painful and sorrowful state of a human deep inside, though externally it may be perceived as simple, to aim towards something like that is——”
“——In short, to place something like that in his work——”
“——The so-called ‘Tendalens’ school of thinking authors aim for was something to the degree of ‘Real, Moral and Neutral’. This thesis——”
“——As I thought, when the important supporting character died in such a commotion, they——”
“——That was a technique to explore the root of being a mother——”
“——I see… I’m beginning to agree with you. Wow, you really read into it very well.”
“It was no big deal.”
“Now that I recall, miss trave… huh? She’s not here.”
“Have you read ‘Relter · Tensun · Rojijiko Nerusare’? That one will get over 80 points, without a doubt.”
“Yes, I have. I give it an undisputed 89 points.  The essential part was the bed scene in the second chapter, don’t you agree? That was a homage to ‘Wheels Only Turn’. Though that scene was indeed necessary for the author to become a more mature writer, the truth is, he just really wanted to write it.  This can also be seen in ‘Package Nineteen’ and his first masterpiece, ‘Gravity Breaking a Window in Forty-Five Years’.”
“Oh. That’s also a great way to read into it. Have you read ‘Bolt Up ~Three-Forked Road of Destiny~’?”
“Of course! I gave it about 88 points. That was the best among the abridged works.”
“What about ‘Kelistoneltones’? A must-read.”
“Five years ago. I read it together with ‘Lulutoneltones’. Well, have you tried ‘So Said the Lamb’?”
“Why of course. What about ‘Tomomma Redeyatsui ~My Love Song~’?”
“It inspired an entire generation. Of course, I’ve read it. What about——”


“——More free time… Hmm?”
“…I see. So the luggage is piled up on top and on both sides… and this one is——”
“Hey! Are you a motorrad thief?”
“Ah! N-no… Uhm, I-I’m just…”
“Hello!”
“Aaah!”
“Yo, Kino. You’re early.”
“Because I saw you from inside.”
“U-uhm…”
“Mister thief, let me introduce you to Kino.”
“Hello. Sorry for surprising you. This is Hermes. Well, if you’re planning to steal Hermes, I’ll have to stop you. I’ll be in trouble, you see.”
“N-no. I just approached a little bit to look closer. I’m sorry for creating a misunderstanding.”
“That’s it?”
“Are you interested in motorrads?”
“No… Well, maybe… I thought you could travel with it.”
“Travel?”
“Yeah. I am interested in traveling…”
“It can certainly be used for traveling. That is, if you know how to ride a motorrad.”
“…No, that’s impossible. I can’t even ride a bicycle. If you’ll excuse me…”
“Uhm, wait.”
“Yes?”
“That’s unusual. Were you possibly thinking of leaving this country?”
“Y-yes. That’s right.”
“Ah, could it be that you have a big, big, big hatred towards books?”
“No. I love books. By that alone, there’s nothing more wonderful than this country. You can read all sorts of books here, you see.”
“That’s it?”
“That’s true. I too, like it. …Even so, you still want to travel?”
“…Yes. …M-miss Kino. Do you have time? Will you listen to my story?”
“I do. Certainly, I’ll listen——”


“The truth is… it is my dream to someday have my own book published. I want everyone to read what I have written. That’s why I want to go on a journey.”
“Eh? Can’t you do that here?”
“That’s correct.”
“Why?”
“Miss Kino, Hermes. I guess you don’t know… it’s possible, but in this country, there’s not a single person who would think of writing something on his own. That is because what they enjoy most is reading. And so, there are neither publishers nor printing presses here.”
“Then where did all those books came from?”
“Several times a year, traders from the so-called ‘bookstores’ would buy up books here and there on wholesale. Everything was brought in from outside, not a single one was made from this country.”
“Oh.”
“I’m surprised.”
“I’ve… loved fantasy ever since I was a child. I enjoy the solitary activity of imagining all sorts of dialogues in my head and conjuring up my own characters. For instance, before going to bed, or when I was supposedly listening to the teacher’s lectures in class.”
“I know what you mean.”
“I don’t.”
“It was also like that when I read books. While I’m enjoying a book, there are moments when my fantasies will be triggered. I think that’s what you call ‘ideas running wildly’.  It was as if, in the middle of reading, I would run and jump into another boat, take the rudder suddenly and change its direction. It would gradually turn into a fantasy story of my own. It’s really fun. There are times when I get lost in my fantasy world, and couldn’t continue reading the book.”
“It happens to me too.”
“Nuh-uh.”
“I couldn’t be satisfied with all of those remaining as mere imaginings. Those fantasies, my stories, I want them to remain. I want them to be passed on in written form. I began to have such thoughts. I want them to be read and known by someone. I want those things that moved me to move others. I want someone to enjoy the things that I enjoy.”
“I get your drift.”
“…No comment.”
“These feelings got stronger each day. That which holds my feelings inside would overflow each time I read a book. In this country, there are many books written by other people. These books are interesting and I love to read them, but this time, I want to try writing my very own book. I am tempted to tell them of my own story every time I hear them talking about something interesting. I don’t know whether it’s a feeling of competitiveness because I know that my story is better or a feeling of jealousy and frustration because they don’t know about it. Maybe it’s both.”
“Uh-huh, go on.”
“I want to publish my own book. That is my dream…. But I am the only one who would think of such a thing in this country. Maybe I’m an oddball. Everybody else would say something like, ‘There are already many books to read in this country, and it’s fun to criticize and award points depending on how much you enjoyed them, so why bother writing your own book?’ Once my friend also said this to my face: ‘Writing? Why would you want to do such a thing?’”
“……”
“……”
“But I couldn’t help it. Within me, there’s something that urges me to write… There’s this thirst that has to be satisfied.”
“And so, you would face the dangers and hardships of traveling for that sake.”
“Exactly! If I can’t do it here, maybe I can do it somewhere else. Maybe I could grab hold of a chance somewhere! Maybe there’s a person or a publishing company who would approve of my work! …But, the thing is, I know next to nothing when it comes to traveling. Like I told you before, I don’t even know how to ride a bike.”
“……. If that’s the case…”
“Yes?”
“If that’s the case, then you have no choice but to remain here. Even if you give up your dream, staying in this country and reading books for the rest of your life is not a bad deal at all, in my opinion. You can think of it as your fate. At least, you can go on living without risking your life.”
“……. I see… to stay here forever. Then all of my fantasies would vanish… no, eventually, I would even forget how to imagine, and live on——” 
“……”
“……”
“Hahaha! There’s a way! For some reason, I just saw a part of my future right now before my eyes! It was like a near-death experience. It was so vivid!”
“I see, so it’s possible for you to imagine your future.”
“That’s right! I could imagine my own life. Like a story in a book. All I need to do is to read that story.”
“Yeah.”
“And I can imagine very well. My own fate is not like the library bookshelves, carefully divided into different genres! Nothing yet! Nothing is written!”
“……”
“……”
“Thank you very much for listening to me. I’ll think about my future one more time.”
“I see. But don’t think too much. There’s no end to thoughts.”
“Kino’s right. Like they say, ‘When an inept person thinks, he grins in his sleep.’”
“Huh?”
“…‘When an inept person thinks, it’s as if he’s asleep’?”
“Yeah, that’s it…”


“Good morning, Hermes.”
“*Yaaaawn* Good morning. …Ah? Huh? Are we leaving already?”
“Yeah.”
“It’s still so early.”
“It’s okay. I’ve eaten breakfast already. I’ve also prepared the stuff we need.”
“That’s not it. I thought you wanted to read books up to the last minute.”
“Nope. Reading is fun, indeed. But we don’t see countries just for that. Other than the books, this country is pretty boring.”
“Uh-huh…. Well, I’m ready to ride whenever. The weather today is great too.”


“…Here. The departure procedures are done. Thank you for staying with us. Please be careful and have a nice trip.”
“Thank you very much.”
“Thanks.”
“Well, shall we go now, Hermes?”
“A’right——”


“Kino, there’s somebody beyond that curve. He’s carrying some big luggage.”
“That is… the person we met yesterday. Stop——”


“Good morning, Miss Kino,  Hermes!”
“Good morning.”
“Morning.”
“I know the road right ahead. Would you like to go together until that place?”
“It’s fine with me. What about you Hermes? Is it okay if I stop your engine? I’ll push you for a while.”
“Sure, do as you like.”


“To tell you the truth, I was really surprised to see you outside the country.”
“Yeah. I was also surprised. Though it’s only by chance, I was really glad we bumped into each other…. As you can see, I have decided to go on a journey from here on.”
“It sure seems like it…. Did something happen?”
“I told my parents about what I was thinking, but then they told me, ‘Even though you’re living a perfect life here, why were you having such stupid thoughts? It’s futile no matter what you do,’ and they restrained me by force. And so, I made a little promise with them: ‘I understand. Father, Mother, I’ll stop thinking about these things,’ and left early this morning.”
“Way to go!”
“Then that promise is a ‘work of fiction’.”
“Hahaha, that’s right. But, when I was about to leave a while ago, I met my friends lined up in front of the library. They spoke to me.”
“What did they say?”
“‘Even though you’re leaving, this place is still the best. We’ll stay here forever. If ever you change your mind, come home. It would be nice to see you again.’”
“…I see.”
“I told them, ‘The next time we meet, even if I’m nearby and right in front of you, I will not listen to you. I don’t care what you tell me, or how many points you give me, I will not respond.’”
“……”
“What’s so funny, Kino?”
“Ah, nothing.”
“In the end, none of them told me to have a nice trip…. Well, that’s okay.”
“……. How in the world do you intend to travel?”
“Now that you mention it.”
“I was thinking about that yesterday. I can’t drive a car or a bicycle.  But, I realized there must be at least one way for me to go to places — I can walk with my two legs. Besides, I was pretty good with skiing a long time ago. And so, for now, I will travel by walking. I’ll go south where snow must be falling soon, and go skiing from there. It will take a long time. But for me, this is the best way. I don’t know where my travels will lead me, or if I would arrive anywhere at all.” 
“I see… It’s good to have that resolve.”
“That’s a pretty big luggage. What’s inside?”
“The long ones at the side are my skis. I’ll use this backpack as the sled. Inside are some clothes and portable rations. But most of it is paper. Half contains what I have written until now, and the rest are for what I will be writing in the future.”
“Oh…”
“Do you have a persuader with you?”
“Yes. I took the lightest one in our house without asking for permission. It’s this here.”
“Ooh. Well, Kino. What’s this?”
“It’s a 2340 model attached with laser sight. If it’s this type, you probably won’t have any problem with bullets. But you should always keep as much ammunition as food. Also, be ready to fire anytime. Disassemble and clean it every day.”
“…I understand. I’ll take care of it.”
“There’s one more important thing.”
“Yes?”
“Whenever you fire, do not waver; whether you’re shooting at an animal that you would eat, or would eat you. At all times, it’s not the survival of other living things, but your own, that should become your priority…. Remember, a corpse cannot hold a pen.”
“…I understand. I won’t forget that.”


“——The leaves are already falling.”
“Yeah. It’s going to be cold soon——”


“We’ll go our separate ways from here. I will walk along the forest to the south.”
“Is that so? …Take care.”
“You too.”
“Thank you very much. …Miss Kino!”
“Yes?”
“I don’t know what will happen from here. But if I happen to survive this winter… I will probably return to my home country to cheer myself up.”
“…That’s a good idea.”
“Thank you for everything. I’m really glad to have met you. Well then——”
“Have a nice trip.”
“Have a nice trip.”
“……! Miss Kino, Hermes…”
“Yes?”
“Yep?”
“I’m off!”


“——After we pass that mountain, we’ll be going through a road heading northwest. After that we should see a wide highway.”
“Okay, I got the route. …By the way, Kino.”
“Hmm?”
“Do you think… things will turn out well for that guy?”
“……”
“Well?”
“No, I don’t think so.”
“Why?”
“It would be nice if you could make a wish come true on your own; especially if it’s something that would take at least ten people to accomplish. That’s why I don’t think things will turn out well.”
“……”
“Chances are it’s going to be like that.”
“…Oh, well. Anyway, what you told him earlier was the same as what Master told you long ago.”
“That’s true. And so——”














"
31,v4c5,4,5,"“Isn’t it a great piece of art?”
The hotel manager asked of the traveler, when he found the traveler looking at a portrait of a battle tank decorating the lobby. In it, the tank was in the midst of blasting away at the enemy.
“I have seen many pictures of tanks by the same artist. Is his work very popular?”
“Good question,” the manager replied, nodding his head several times before continuing in a hushed tone. “There was a civil war between the races here about ten years ago. Neighbor killed neighbor for four years and six months before we finally realized the futility of the war.”
“…Does the war have anything to do with this picture?”
“This portrait reminds us about that foolish war that every citizen in this nation abhors. The artist rekindled our disgust with war by painting images of battle scenes, strengthening our resolution against war. That is why his works are common in the nation.”
“Ah, I see.”
“Two years ago, this artist appeared out of nowhere, painting nothing but tanks on the battlefield, every one of them a great piece in itself. Not only has he become famous for his works, but he was also appointed as our Ambassador of Peace. Traveler, have you been to the city hall?”


After stepping into the richly built stone and mortar building, an open gallery stood to welcome all visitors. On one of the gallery’s walls was a huge painting. It was a battle scene on a wide open field, and tanks could be seen in this piece as well. Below the painting was a stone slab with these words:
[Behold! Behold the hands of the dead reaching for the sky from their burning tank, telling us to learn from our mistake and aim for a higher purpose called Peace.]
“Amazing isn’t it? Those words were written by the current governor.”
Announced a man in his fifties, who proclaimed himself the headmaster of a primary school that had just purchased a piece of artwork from the artist.
“I plan to have it on display so that the students will learn the horrors of war. That battle tanks are not objects of admiration, but merely tools for ravaging the lives of many. It cost a heavy sum but I believe it will serve better than a book in telling the lesson. Traveler, have you seen the art book?”
Stacked in the most convenient spot were copies of the aforementioned art book. Even before the traveler managed to reach down for a copy, another copy had just been sold at the counter.
On the cover was a note,
[Rebuilding the Nation with Canvas, a must read for all citizens.]
The traveler flipped through the art book.
Sure enough, it was filled with the images of tanks in war. One of them had a comment made by the book writer.
[We can only watch as the tanks grind mercilessly over the flowers, each one of them representing the lost life of a nameless soldier.]
Also included were comments made by the gallery owner who first discovered the talented artist.
[…although his works are only of battle tanks, it is not the image that matters but the message of the artist itself. The tank may have powerful weaponry and great armor, but on the field of war it is not invincible. This painting symbolizes the strength and frailness of man’s determination. Which is…]
The traveler closed the book with a thud and recalled the words of the excited hotel manager.
“A masterpiece has great power, and it deeply moves the emotion of the viewer. Five years, ten years, maybe even twenty years from now, how will I feel when I look upon this portrait again? I hope that, at that time, I feel the same way toward it that I do now.”


On the morning of the third day, Kino rose with the sun as always.
“Good morning, Hermes.”
Luggage was piled on the motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) called Hermes, and they left the inn shortly after.
Later, as they were traveling along a stretch of lonely road in the outlying farmland, they came across a young man sitting alone on a stool.
“Wow, that is a nice motorrad you’ve got there. Are you a traveler?”
Kino and Hermes slowed to a stop.
“Yes, we were just leaving.”
“What are you doing out here?” Hermes chirped.
“I’m a painter, and I’m here to gather inspiration.” Leaning on his stool was a folded easel, a huge canvas, and a bag stained with different colors of paint.
“Hmm… are your works popular?”
“Yep, my works are everywhere. There’s even one at the city hall.”
“Are they about the tanks?” Hermes asked again.
“Yeah, you have seen them?”
Kino nodded. “Yes, they are everywhere. Can I ask you a question?”
“Sure.”
“Why do you only draw tanks on the battlefield?”
The painter beamed and replied, “Good question!” He answered happily.
“I love tanks! Aren’t they cool? They have great armor, a powerful arsenal and treads that grind over everything! They are the kings of the battlefield!”
A grin slowly crept on Kino’s face.
“I just love to paint tanks running through the battlefield, that’s why I draw them and nothing else. One day I took a painting to the art gallery and they told me it would sell very well. I was speechless! They kept saying something about ‘never repeating past mistakes’ and then offered me a large sum of money. Now I could eat anything I want and buy all the materials I need. And the best thing of all is I could spend the whole day painting!”
“You seem to be doing very well.”
Hearing that from Hermes, the young painter nodded eagerly.
“I am very happy with my life now. Why, I get to do what I love! Hey traveler, you get to see a lot of places right? I bet you have seen different types of tanks in other countries. Maybe there is a tank that can submerge in water, have multiple turrets, or fires armor-piercing uranium cores or maybe fragment shells that explode inside the tank.” The painter stared dreamily into space, and then his eyes suddenly brightened.
“That’s right! That’s why I love tanks! I’m getting some much needed inspiration. This time I’ll draw a turretless type, with its cannon fixed on the frame, and aims using a hydraulic suspension system! Oh! It will have a dozer that ambushes the enemy in their foxholes! And with one hit of its 105mm cannon, the enemy’s tank will be set ablaze and the soldiers inside will come out dancing like dolls on fire!  Yeah, serves them right! I’ll annihilate them all! Cool! It will be an amazing picture!” 
The painter trembled, his hands formed into fists. Then he immediately set up his easel and put the canvas in place.
“It’s about time for us to go.” Kino started Hermes’ engine and turned to the young man who was starting to slab paint on his palette. “Please take care, and continue to draw nice pictures.”
“Thank you! You take care, too. Have a nice trip!” The painter answered with a smile.
And the motorrad rode away, leaving the young man painting another battle tank.














"
32,v4c6,4,6,"It was the second day in the country. 
While on her way to pick up Hermes at the car park after lunch, Kino encountered a bickering couple in front of the motorrad. They appeared to be a married couple in their thirties, and beside them stood a boy, about ten years old and looking more than a little lost. 
The father spoke. “That’s why I’m telling you —— you’re being overprotective!” 
The mother retaliated. “No! You are being stubborn. This is for his own good!” 
The three were blocking her way to Hermes.
Kino began by clearing her throat, “Ahem!” 
Before she could manage to say “Excuse me, may I pass through and get to my motorrad behind you?” the father noticed her and asked,
“What do you think?”
“About what? I didn’t hear the conversation…” Kino cocked an eyebrow, amused by the sudden question. But before the father could explain himself, the mother interjected,
“This stubborn man insists that our boy doesn’t need a bulletproof vest.” 
“Why would he need something like that?” asked Kino. 
“The war, of course! Our son is joining the army,” replied the father. 
“War?” 
“Yes, it broke out a few months back. It is the first one we’ve had since the country was founded. The army has been recruiting soldiers for the front lines. My son will be joining the army today. Not to boast, but he will make a fine soldier, and probably return a hero too! But this foolish wife of mine keeps insisting that he wears a bulletproof vest. What nonsense.” 
“Honey, the vest will protect our son from shrapnel!” 
“He just needs to crouch down to avoid that, not to mention there are trenches to take cover in.” 
“Even so, it will protect him from all sorts of things. He can’t be a hero if he gets hurt; our son needs to be able to do his best to become a hero.” 
“But won’t the vest be heavy? He can’t move freely if he’s bogged down. Soldiers should have the grace of a butterfly and the sting of a bee! Also, his squad will ridicule him if he’s the only one wearing one.” 
“All he needs to do is say it’s a gift from his loving mother.” 
After listening to the parents, Kino glanced at the boy and said in a carefully neutral tone, 
“Why don’t you ask the boy’s opinion?”
“Oh… you’re right! What do you think, Timmy? You will listen to mommy, won’t you?” The mother bent down to gently place her hands on his shoulders.
The father also squatted down next to him, and held up an encouraging fist. “Come on son! You are a man, right? Real men don’t need this junk.” 
“Don’t worry, mommy and daddy will respect your decision.” 
“That’s right, boy!” 
The boy answered with a quaver in his voice, “I… I don’t wanna go to war!”
The father immediately stood up, and with a tone completely different from before, “We’re doing this for your own good!” 
The mother also stood up and stared down at her son. “You need to join the army and become a hero. That way, you will be able to enter a good college and university, and then you will get to work for a large company. Don’t you understand? We are doing this for you. Didn’t you say that everyone in your class is joining? Do you want to lose to them? Is it okay with you if you get left behind?” 
“But… Johnny’s parents won’t let him go.” 
The mother began to raise her voice at her son. “What Johnny does is not our problem. You should decide for yourself!” 
“That’s right! You shouldn’t compare yourself to others!” 
The poor boy’s face went pale with terror after this outburst from his parents. 
The mother took out a brand new bulletproof vest from her bag. The small vest was still wrapped in plastic. An attached card read: “To our brave young soldiers! Specially designed to reduce stress on the shoulders. Now with adjustable height to suit growing children. Ideal for long term use.” 
She half-squatted and placed one hand behind her son, gently urging him. “Put this one on and let’s go to the recruitment center. Don’t be scared. Mommy will be with you.” 
“See? Like I said, you are being overprotective.” 
“I just want the best for our son!” 
“I know. Just stop overdoing it.” 
And so the bickering began anew. In the midst of it, the boy timidly said again, “I don’t wanna go.” 
“Not again! You must have inherited that cowardice from your mother’s side.” 
“What?! Ooooh! He’s as stubborn as you are, you old mule!” 
Again the boy protested, now almost crying, “I… really… don’t want to go!” 
Kino interjected, her voice still carefully controlled,
“Maybe you should rethink this with the boy.” 
The parents gave Kino a horrified and insulted look. 
“Why don’t you mind your own business? This is a family matter.” 
“Yeah, this is our problem! We are doing this for our child.” 
“Right,” Kino nodded. “I’ll do that.”
“Come on.” The mother grabbed the boy’s hand and began to drag him away. “We should head to the recruitment center before it’s too late. We’ll decide about the vest once we get there.” 
“Let’s go, Timmy.” 
Kino watched as the parents dragged their son away.
She shook her head, and turned back towards Hermes. The motorrad greeted Kino as she kicked up the stand. 
“Must have been tough.” 
Kino answered honestly before hopping onto Hermes.
“Yeah. It was.”














"
33,v4c7,4,7,"Amidst a sultry marshland was a lone road.
This flat land was mottled with stagnant pools of water blanketed with water-dwelling vegetation. The road twisted and turned as it traced a path around the swamps.
The road made of reddish-brown earth was wide, but its edges had been completely decayed by rainfall. Not even its center was spared from dampness. It seemed to have melded with its surroundings due to the intense heat and humidity.
The brightly-feathered waterfowl creating a clamor in the swamps with their choking caws suddenly took flight all at once. A lone motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) emerged, making its way through the slushy road.
It was a motorrad which, instead of a back seat, had a carrier loaded heavily with traveling luggage. The raucous roar of its engine reverberated freely.
Its rider donned a black vest on top of a shirt, lapels undone. A wide belt was fastened around her waist. She wore a brimmed hat on top of her black hair, and had goggles strapped over her eyes. The face beneath it was young, around mid-teens.
A hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun, in this case, a pistol) was installed inside a holster over her right thigh. It was a single-action revolver, which means that its hammer had to be raised every time was fired.
The rider drove the motorrad prudently, yet thick mud would occasionally accumulate inside the front wheels, making her lose balance. At times, she would have to make the rear wheel spin madly, hurling sludge all over, just to escape from a muddy rut.
“I’ve said this many times over… this is such a bad road.” The motorrad spoke to its rider.
“Yeah. I wonder if this takes us longer than expected. Here goes…” The rider answered as she hoisted up the motorrad that slipped on its rear wheel once more. Beads of sweat formed on her cheeks.
“But you know, Kino,” the motorrad initiated after running for a while. 
“What?” the rider called Kino replied.
“After suffering this much, it would be a real waste if the country we’re heading to is a bore.”
“That’s true, but like we were told before, ‘There is always something worth seeing in any country, one way or the other.’”
“I wonder if that’s true.”
Kino loosened the gaze beneath the goggles.
“But if that’s the case, then it wouldn’t really matter where we go…. Hermes, since it’s not yet too late, how about we change our route?” Kino suggested. She stopped the motorrad called Hermes on a relatively dry part of the road. “What should we do? Anywhere’s fine. There’s also a road just a bit to the south. There should also be a country over there.”
Hermes considered the proposition for a while before he replied,
“It’s nice asking my opinion for once, but it’s your call.”
“All right… Then let’s continue this way.”
“Okay. But why?”
“Just a hunch. It’s not like there’s anyone waiting for me, or there’s anyone who needs me badly in some country. I just thought it would be troublesome to go back. Besides, there’s no assurance that the other road will be better than this one.” 
“That’s it?”
Kino launched Hermes, and pressed forward, cutting through the mud. They ran as slowly as ever.
Kino complained teasingly. “It would be great if you could run over water, Hermes. That way we could cross the swamps and run in a straight line.”
“That’s absurd. Motorrads can’t run over water.” Hermes spoke with utmost seriousness that Kino had to ask,
“Wanna try?”
“No need, I already know. There are many things motorrads can’t do. We’re different from humans.”
“What, I can’t walk on water either.”
Hermes immediately countered, “But you can build a boat and ride it… because you’re human.”
“I see…. But,”
“But?”
“I can’t do it after all. I may have grown fond of traveling on you, Hermes,” Kino answered after a pause.
“Ah! You just told me something nice! Let’s go faster!”
“Okay!”
And so Kino and Hermes proceeded with much enthusiasm.
But soon after, the rear wheel got stuck in a deep mud, rendering the motorrad immobile once more.
“Ah!” “Ah!”


“Welcome, traveler! Welcome to our country! It has been a long time since we’ve had a guest. This is really fortunate! Did you have any trouble on the way here?”
The soldier who stood eagerly in front of the towering walls and gigantic gates beamed at the rider coming with her motorrad.
“Not really.”
Kino took off her hat and goggles and replied with poise despite her legs being caked with mud from sole to knee, and her gloves and shirt sleeves in no better state. There were even tiny splotches of dried mud on her face. Meanwhile, both of Hermes’ wheels had been dyed brown, and the clods of mud that clung onto his engine were baked dry with the heat.
“That’s great!” the guard said with a smile.


Kino and Hermes passed the gates as soon as they finished the entry procedures.
Before the gates was an elliptical plaza. Just a bit ways off was a row of wooden, one-storey houses crowded together. Every single one was elevated, with stout, wooden pillars that pierced the ground. The narrow road was entirely paved, a step higher than the ground itself.
There were several men in the park. They approached with smiles, perhaps in anticipation of Kino and Hermes.
“Good afternoon, traveler. Welcome to our country. I am the person who was given charge of this country’s affairs.”
Kino took off her hat and gave a slight bow to the middle-aged man who introduced himself as the chief.
“Good afternoon. I am Kino, and this is my partner, Hermes.”
“It’s really wonderful of you to come. You are the first guest we’ve had in five years. There’s no hotel in our country, so we’ll have to accommodate you in our country’s reception hall. Of course, we won’t ask for payment of any sort. You deserve no less, being our country’s guest.”
The chief then bowed deeply, and the other men followed suit. 
Hermes voiced out a whistle. “Isn’t that great, Kino? It’s the first time you get to be treated like this. It’s a good thing we chose this road – just how many times did we think of turning back? That road was so horrible; you couldn’t blame anyone thinking that the country ahead’s inhabi––”
Kino kicked Hermes in the middle of his dialogue, and bowed to the chief and his followers. “That’s really kind of you. We’re very grateful.”


Kino and Hermes were guided to the reception hall.
Though it was called such, it was only a larger version of the stilt houses they saw earlier. When Kino inquired, she was told that this building was typically used for harvest festivals, concerts, and elections. Around it was the town hall, the chief’s residence, the courthouse, and so on, but it was really hard to tell which one is which.
The only difference is that the road facing these buildings was more impressive. It was wide, and paved like a highway. More importantly, there were magnificent bronze statues standing at its center.
The chief introduced it as the country’s one and only main road. And that the bronze statues on its center were of those leaders who have accomplished great deeds for the country.
Then, as if in a trance, he spoke fervently of how he was working hard to attain his lifetime dream of someday having his own statue that can watch over this road for eternity.
Kino borrowed a tap and thoroughly washed the mud off herself and Hermes. By the time she finished, the beautiful orange rays of the evening sun was already shining across the sky.
They were given a fine room. Kino placed Hermes in one corner and removed the luggage from him.
The chief eagerly invited Kino to that night’s welcome party. But some sensible person suggested pushing the event to the next day, as the traveler must be tired.
Kino ate her dinner in the dining hall, took a longed-for shower, and went straight to sleep.


The morning of the next day.
As usual, Kino woke up at dawn.
She performed her exercises in the spacious room, then cleaned and practiced with ‘Canon’, the persuader on her right thigh.
Just when Kino finished her free breakfast, the chief came to invite her to a welcome tea party in his official residence.
“It will be boring. I’m sure of it,” Hermes commented in a voice audible only to Kino.
“I know,” Kino said with a nod. “But they lent us a room. We have to get along with them, you know, to return the favor.”
“Hmph.”
Kino and Hermes went out to the main road. The weather was good, but there was a strong, damp wind blowing. The chief explained, “During this season, there is a strong wind that blows only during the morning. But it will be calm for the rest of the day.”
Kino drank tea together with the chief, his wife, and his followers in the lobby of the official residence.
At first, they were talking about Kino’s travels, but after a while, the conversation turned into a solo recital of the chief, who rattled on about the greatness of their country.
Originally, this country was part of a swampy, uninhabitable region. But with the persistent efforts of their great ancestors, it turned into a fertile agricultural land. Though small, it was abundant in food. Everyone lived in harmony with each other, and the public order was good. Just as he said the day before, the chiefs who had achievements worthy of merit will have a bronze statue made for them.
“Well as for me, I haven’t done much yet. It’s embarrassing.” Then the chief added confidently, “But since my appointment, the grain harvest has improved by three percent!”
While Kino interjected as appropriate during the chief’s harangue, she noticed that Hermes had fallen asleep behind her.
Kino was invited for lunch in the official residence’s dining hall. After the splendid meal, they went back to the lobby again, where tea has been prepared.
“Oh right! There’s this story too…” the chief began. It was time for another long story.


“Chief! I have a request!”
Along with the high-pitched voice, the door slammed open and a woman in her late twenties came in. With her oil-stained overalls, she headed straight to the chief’s seat.
The people around tried to stop her, but wasn’t able to do anything. Without giving so much as a glance towards Kino and Hermes, she stood in front of the chief and took out a letter from her breast pocket.
With a look of exasperation, the chief read her letter. Soon his face stiffened, and he raised his voice,
“Absolutely not! How many times do I have to tell you before you understand?!”
The trespassing woman and the chief began to argue.
“Just two would do! And it’ll be only for that time!”
“Even if it’s only one, I won’t allow it! What do you take our great leaders for?!”
“Didn’t you want to be merited for great achievements? I can help you get a bronze statue for yourself, Chief.”
“You can’t grant it! Not with something out of a fantasy!”
“We won’t know if we don’t try!”
Kino drank her tea as she watched the two.
“We know even if we don’t!”
“We won’t!”
“Good grief, please come to your senses!”
“You’re the one who ought to do that!”
“Enough!”
“I won’t give up! Eh… wait! Let me go!”
Before the argument turned to insults, the woman was dragged out of the building.
The chief drew a deep breath and shook his head several times, then explained to Kino, “Ah, that was unsightly. But it was decided that the chief had to listen to the citizen’s appeals no matter where or when.”
“I see. Then, that person just now, what was she appealing about?”
“She was asking to take down the bronze statues. …Well please don’t concern yourself with it, traveler…. More than that, let’s return to our stories.”
“Ah, I’d love to but,” Kino slowly stood up and politely,
“I have learned a lot about your history. Thank you very much. Next, we would like to tour the country on our own. Is that all right?”


After finally being released, Kino and Hermes exited the chief's residence and rode among the pedestrians.
“You were asleep the whole time weren’t you, Hermes,” Kino grumbled with a hint of envy.
“Yup, I had a good sleep. That racket woke me up, though.” Just as Hermes replied, Kino saw the woman before. She was on a bicycle, but she rode with the speed of a motorrad.
“It’s that person.” Kino overtook the woman and gave her a bow without stopping Hermes. The woman spoke to Kino as she rode her bicycle.
“You were that traveler earlier, right?”
“Yes,” Kino replied out loud.
“I’m sorry for causing such a ruckus.”
“I don’t mind. I was able to escape that place thanks to you.”
The woman snickered at Kino’s answer.
“By the way, why do you want to have the statues taken down?” Hermes asked. The woman looked at them for a while.
“Oh, about that… do you have time, traveler?”
“We have. As long as it’s not another boastful speech about this country.”
“You’re a frank one, aren’t you? Anyway, I’ll show you something interesting. Come with me.”
Then the woman swiftly turned into an alley. It was so sudden that Kino rode past it, and in a flurry, turned around and followed the woman.


As they neared the country’s outskirts and the walls became more visible, the number of houses lessened and the view became increasingly dominated by fields and paddies. People doing farm work could be seen everywhere.
Without slowing down, the woman made a turn at a narrow and winding road, and stopped in front of a warehouse surrounded by fields. Nearby was a splendid manor and a crane truck.
The woman slipped off the upper half of her overalls and tucked it at the waist over her shirt. She poured tap water over her sweaty head and dried it with a towel. Then she faced Kino.
“Welcome to my house. I’m Nimya, Nimya Tchuhachkova. Nice to meet you.”
“Hello. I’m Kino, and this here is my partner, Hermes.”
“Hi there.”
Nimya half-opened the door to the warehouse and invited Kino and Hermes inside.
The interior was dark, humid, and reeked of machine oil.
“Now I’ll answer your question. I want to turn the main road into a long, straight path. That’s why the bronze statues have to be moved,” Nimya explained. 
Still doubtful, Kino asked. “What for?”
“It’s… for this.”
At the same time, Nimya pressed a switch in her hand. The lights hanging from the ceiling slowly lit up, and  ventilation fans also started to run.
There was a transport crane dangling from the ceiling. The floor was lined up with various construction machines, and one corner of the room was littered with a mountain of scrap metal. There were several desks cluttered with documents. There were also a number of bicycles hanging side-by-side in one corner.
And at the center of the warehouse was a silver machine.
Roughly the size of a truck, it had a body like that of a fish with its streamlined form and dorsal and tail fins. At its tail end was a device that looked like a three-bladed fan, and arranged symmetrically on its sides were two panel-like protrusions, the span of which was longer than the machine’s overall length. And below these protrusions were two legs that had tires at the end.
“What… is this thing?” Kino asked after trying to figure it out for a while.
“It doesn’t have a name yet, but…” Nimya turned to Kino and Hermes. Then she declared with a bold yet beautiful smile, “With this… I will soar to the skies!”
Kino asked immediately, “You can fly with that? How?”
Nimya nodded and quickly explained.
“If you hold a plank horizontally against the wind, nothing will happen, right? But if you place it at an angle, even if it’s only a little,  a force that moves the plank forward and upward is generated. The same idea is in effect when you raise your head while riding a bicycle, causing your hat to fly off. So using this concept, if you attach an angled plank to an object – it doesn’t have to be a bicycle – and let it run at a particular speed, it will be lifted to the air by the plank. And that object should be able to fly.”
After listening to her words, Kino only muttered, “How… nicely thought out.”
“I guess. But I haven’t had the chance to test out this machine yet. For it to fly, I need a long, flat, and perfectly straight road. No other place could meet those conditions inside or outside this country, except for that road. But those bronze statues are in the way. I’ll do whatever it takes to have them moved!”
“Now I understand. But the chief is against it…. Does he think it’s impossible?”
“Yes. And not just him. Everyone in this country thinks that it is not possible for humans to fly using a machine. No matter how many times I explain the theory to them, it’s no use. That’s why I wanted to show them proof!”
“Oh…”
Kino stared at the machine in its bare, metallic form, and observed a nine-cylinder engine installed in front of its body.
Meanwhile, Nimya prepared Kino some tea. As it was served to her, Kino asked, “It has an interesting scent. What kind of tea is it?”
“Hmm? It’s tea brewed from the gallnut of a tree in this country. Oh, and it’s very nutritious.”
Afterwards Nimya sat on a desk, and offered Kino a chair. Then as if finally having gathered up her resolve, Nimya asked, “Hey, Hermes. Since you’re a motorrad, do you know whether it will function just as I imagined it? Or won’t it?”
Hermes answered right away. “I do. I’ve known the moment I heard your explanation. I don’t mind answering, but before that, let me ask you the same question. What do you think? Do you honestly believe it will fly?”
“……!” Nimya was tongue-tied for a moment, then answered without hesitation, “It will fly! I can’t be wrong! It will fly!” 
Nimya gripped her mug so hard that the tea slightly spilled. Kino sipped a mouthful from her own.
“Correct. Judging from its appearance, it can fly. You can also control it. The only thing you need is a long and level runway,” Hermes said.
“I knew it!”
“Hmm…”
Kino only muttered as Nimya leaped in joy.
But Nimya’s joy soon turned into a deep sigh, “A road, eh? But that’s the toughest hurdle of all…”
At that moment, a car’s engine was heard from outside followed by a violent rapping at the entrance.
“Nimya Tchuhachkova. Please open the door. It’s me.”
It was the chief’s voice. Nimya clicked her tongue and pressed the switch beside the desk. The warehouse shutters opened, allowing the sunlight to get in. Footsteps of more than ten people, led by the chief, came in.
“Good afternoon, Chief. For you to pay me a visit… could it be that my appeal was already approved?”
“Of course not. …Oh, traveler, how come you’re here?”
“I invited her out for tea and told her my story. I’m just welcoming our honored guest, am I not allowed to do so?”
The chief made a sullen face, but finally calmed himself after some effort.
“Nimya. There is something I would like to tell you.”
“And what would that be?”
“All citizens are free to do anything they want as long as they don’t commit crimes or create trouble for the community. However, this country’s council has decided that you shall no longer be allowed to waste time and money on this ‘flying machine’ and other worthless matters.”
The chief delivered his speech with a dignified and deliberate tone. Nimya only glared back, though not impolitely, and gave a curt reply, “It’s not ‘worthless’. That’s all I have to say.”
Kino and Hermes could almost hear the molars of the chief grinding in frustration.
A middle-aged man spoke up. “Chief. It’s no use no matter what you tell her. This woman has gone crazy. Just look at this weird machine.”
“Don’t you dare touch it!” Nimya gave a piercing shriek to the man who tried to approach the machine.
“Hah!” he jeered. “I’m not going to touch such a bizarre object.”
The man peered at the machine from the front, and with a tone full of mockery, “Oh my. To use such a fine engine on a thing like this… You can see for yourselves, this is nothing but an enormous fan!”
“Exactly. In theory, it’s the same as a fan.”
“Ohh? So you’re saying that if I use a fan in a particular way, it will fly! Care to tell this foolish old man the trick?”
Laughter erupted from the crowd. Nimya, unfazed by the taunt, began her explanation.
“The machine will be drawn forward by that.”
“Drawn forward? By this fan?”
“Yes. The wind that it generates can produce the force to move it towards the opposite direction. When these ‘wings’ turn at a high speed and send wind towards the machine, it will move forward. It will run.”
There was a two second gap before the man burst into laughter.
“Hahahahahaha! Isn’t that amazing!”
“What’s so funny?!”
“Hahaha. Come to think of it, I have used fans for years — haha — But not one ever moved from my desk! —ahaha— Isn’t that funny?”
The man doubled up in laughter. Several people from the crowd also started to laugh.
“For it to work in the case of a normal fan, it needs to overcome friction with the desk! You should try it on a big flat, frozen surface, and you’ll see how strong wind power is!” Nimya insisted.
The man continued as he wiped his tears from laughing too hard. “Okay—. Then, what sort of magic spell should you use to get this giant fan moving?” 
Laughter resounded once more in the warehouse. Nimya muttered, “These ignorant geezers.”
After some time, when the laughter has completely subsided, another man spoke to Nimya.
“Assuming that this thing does move… well, it does have tires. But you also claim that it could fly?”
“Yes. If it moves at a fast enough speed, it will be lifted by those wings,” Nimya explained as she pointed to the panels at the sides.
“By wings, don’t tell me you mean those flat protrusions from the sides?”
“Yes.”
“How do I say this… there must be some mistake in the design,” the man pointed out seriously, and Nimya promptly retorted.
“What did you say?!”
The man put on airs, and continued, “But see, if they’re fixed on the body… there’s no way they could flap.”
Another round of laughter from the crowd. And another explanation from Nimya.
“They don’t have to flap! As air flows from the front to back, a difference in the amount of air above and below the wings will develop. When that happens, there will be a force that will make it move upwards. I can show you my experiment!”
Nimya flicked the switch of the fan on the table.
A board placed perfectly in front of the wind moved diagonally, and then it floated.
“What do you think? It uses the same principle.”
The man was not particularly surprised, and answered without hesitation. “Such a light plank must be able to float. But how heavy do you think this weird contraption is? Perhaps as heavy as you are?”
“……”
For the third time, laughter filled the room, and Nimya became silent out of disgust. The chief finally spoke, “Good grief. To go along with this frivolous talk.”
“All of you…” Nimya spoke slowly. “Won’t you let me test it at least?”
“If you’re going again about tearing down the bronze statues for the sake of that test, then no way. Do you feel like destroying your house just to see if you can talk with ants?”
“If there is any possibility at all, I’ll do it as early as tomorrow. I will need your help then.” Nimya glared at the chief. The chief shook his head.
“Dear, dear. If only you made a machine that can be helpful in farming…. To waste the hard-earned fortune of your parents like this…”
“It’s not a waste! This will fly!”
“Only if you are a wizard! Oh my, isn’t that thing too fat to use as a broom, miss witch?”
Another one mocked, and everyone laughed. The chief issued a final warning to Nimya.
“Tomorrow afternoon, we will come to dismantle this weird machine. I’m afraid to say that as long as this thing exists, you will not be cured of your delusions. This is a final and immediate decision by the council. We will buy the engine and use it for a generator. Do you have anything to say?”
“I have.”
“What is it?”
“Won’t you move the bronze statues?”
The reply came immediately.
“Rejected.”
“……”
“Now everyone. That’s it for today. Go home. We’ll continue this tomorrow.”
The chief turned away and the rest of the crowd also left the warehouse.
The low hum of the ventilation fan echoed in the empty warehouse.
Nimya gulped down the already cold tea, and spoke to Kino and Hermes, who only looked on quietly from the start.
“Phew. It’s just as you’ve seen. Not so boring, huh?”
“Well, yeah. …But there’s one more guy left.”
“Eh?”
Nimya turned around. There was indeed one person left — a young man wearing a neat, wrinkle-less, uniform. He gazed at Nimya grimly.
Nimya turned to Kino and Hermes, “Let me introduce you. This is my fiancée. It has been a long time since we met.”
Kino bowed. The fiancée talked as he approached Nimya, “Nimya. You should understand by now. Won’t you stop doing this sort of thing?”
“What do you mean by ‘this sort of thing’?”
“Dreaming of riding this machine and flying. I don’t want to say this, but I know that there’s almost nothing left of the fortune you inherited from your parents. I also know that you haven’t eaten any decent meal recently. And that you will most likely be broke by next week.”
“……”
“You can live with me starting tomorrow. Move out of this place.”
“……”
“There doesn’t seem to be any malice in his proposal. But you know——” Hermes spoke to Kino who formed her fingers into a shush gesture.
The fiancée pleaded gently to the wordless Nimya.
“Can I stay here for tonight? I have something I would like to discuss with you.”
“…I’m sorry, I have something to do.” Nimya answered brokenly.
“What is it? Can I help you?” The fiancée offered at once, but Nimya only shook her head. Then she grabbed him aggressively at the collar and planted a light kiss on his lips.
“No… just go home for today, I’ll get in touch with you tomorrow.”


The warehouse shutters were firmly closed as soon as the young man left.
Then Nimya walked briskly towards the flying machine and slapped its silver body with her palm.
“I have no time to waste! This will have to fly by tomorrow morning. And when it does, those obstinate mules will have to acknowledge it!”
“If only we have a road,” Hermes quipped.
“Yeah! It will fly if only we have that. I’ll be satisfied as long as it flies – even if it’s just once! After that, I don’t really care. I don’t even mind crashing it in the chief’s house!”
“Really?” Hermes asked amusingly, and Nimya’s tone reverted back.
“…Well in any case, I’ll have to think things through calmly.” Nimya returned to the desk, handing a chair to Kino, who lightly thanked her and seated herself. Kino leaned on Hermes.
“At things stand, the gliding distance is still too short. I’ve computed it many times already, but even with the strong wind in the morning, there will still be at least one bronze statue on the way. It will be able to lift, but it will get dragged by that one statue,” Nimya said as she looked at a piece of paper full of calculations.
“Even if you maximized the engine output?” Hermes asked.
“It won’t be enough.” Nimya and Hermes whined. Kino, who had no chance to speak earlier, casually chirped in.
“What about making a ramp before the statue to jump from? That’s what’s normally done to clear obstacles in the case of motorrads. This machine should be able to do the same thing…” Nimya stared at Kino dumbfoundedly. Kino added, “…Maybe?”
Nimya considered it for a moment before speaking. “That’s right. If we do that, we don’t have to move the statues…. That may work!”
“Kino, you’re so smart!”
Kino slightly scratched her head at Hermes’ gleeful praise. “Eh? Well, thanks.”
“Just wait! I’ll make the calculations.” Nimya got to work on her desk and made numerous calculations. But her face returned to its bitter look after a while. 
“It won’t work. Even if I make a ramp before the statue, it will still require much speed. If I jump with what I have, I’ll fall immediately.”
“So it won’t do, huh.”
“But I’ll work on this idea! I only have to do something about the launching speed. That’s the only thing left for this to work.” Once again, Hermes and Nimya grumbled, and once again Kino casually remarked.
“Well you could launch it with a gunpowder explosion, the way bullets are propelled in a persuader. Maybe…”
Nimya took one glance at Kino but quickly shook her head. “That’s not possible. I understand that idea, but to propel something this big, we will need a tunnel just as huge. Besides, even if we do have something like that, the machine will break.”
“Is that so…”
“Rejected. Sorry,” Hermes said. Kino pointed her finger at Hermes beneath her. Then,
“Bang.”
She mimicked the firing of a hand persuader. Then she lifted her right hand.
Nimya who was looking at her, knitted her eyebrows together and asked, “Kino. Just now, you were pretending to fire a persuader, right?”
“Huh? Yeah.”
“But you raised your right hand.”
“Of course. The recoil of this persuader is pretty strong,” Kino said as she tapped Canon on her thigh. Nimya’s gaze froze, though she was not looking at anything in particular.
Then she cried out, “That’s it!”
“Huh?”
“I don’t need the blast, the recoil would be enough! Just like in a persuader, I’ll put gunpowder inside a pipe, ignite them consecutively to produce a gas at high speeds! If I put several such pipes on the machine, it will be able to dash!” While pointing inside the warehouse, “I have pipes! I have gunpowder! I can do this!”
“I get it! Kino, you’re smart after all!” Hermes squealed in excitement.
But Kino could only mutter.
“What?”


The next day, that is, the third day since Kino entered the country.
The chief did not wake up at dawn.
He continued his pleasant slumber on top of his bed, where a refreshing wind passes through.
The sunlight filtered through the windows, and just when a powerful breeze blew in, noises coming from the main road wakened him: the low drone of a truck’s engine, and the crashing sounds of something being laid down.
At that moment, fierce knocks were heard from the door, and his subordinate entered in a panic.
“Chief! Y-you have to see what’s happening outside!”
The chief hurriedly put on his clothes. And upon coming out to the main road, he was rendered speechless.
In front of the official residence, the shortest bronze statue had turned into a ramp. It looked as if it was saddled with pipes and iron plates.
“Good morning, Chief.”
The one who greeted the chief with a smile was Kino, who was going through the road placing ropes on the boundary with the walkway. The ropes were wrapped in yellow cloth printed with the words ‘Danger. Please do not go to the road beyond this line’ in black letters.
The chief turned his gaze to the nearest bronze statue. Just before it was a machine, glittering silver underneath the morning light. It was the flying machine from the warehouse. But it had an added touch that was not there the day before – several thick pipes attached below its body. Nearby was the crane truck owned by the Tchuhachkova family.
The chief shook his head several times, and blinked his eyes.
On the opposite walkway, Kino was briskly laying down the ropes. Several people have come out, staring in shock and wondering what was going on. Kino addressed them with a smile.
“Everyone. Please do not go beyond these ropes. It’s dangerous.”
Hermes was parked obliquely in front of the plane. Nimya in her overalls was tying a rope on Hermes’ carrier. The other end of the rope was tied to the tires of the flying machine.
Nimya climbed up the machine and sat in its cockpit. She put on her working goggles and gloves, and fastened the four-point seat belt. Then she waved to Kino who was now sitting astride Hermes, and gave her a thumbs up.
Kino started Hermes’ engine. The boisterous roar of the engine reverberated across the road. The chief rushed to Kino and asked, “Traveler! What in the world is happening here?!”
“Chief. It’s extremely dangerous, so please stand back.” Right after saying these words, Hermes’ engine let out three explosive roars. The engine of the flying machine roared, and the giant fan began to turn. 
The chief tried to say something, but Kino could no longer hear it.
The explosion prompted the people to gather, and soon the sidewalk was filled with bystanders. There were also those who looked out from their houses.
Kino gestured to the Chief to stand back, and then turned to Nimya who was looking back at her.
The roar coming from the machine became even louder.
Nimya raised both fists high in the air, and crossed them over her head. Then the moment she opened her arms, Kino quickly launched Hermes. The tirestops of the flying machine disconnected at the same time.
The machine began to slide forward. At the next moment, its engine gave off a roar that seemed three times louder. The pipes underneath its body spouted white smoke with great force.
“It exploded!”
“No. It’s fine.”
The chief shouted and Hermes muttered to no one in particular. The machine accelerated, as if it was kicked by some invisible giant, and sped to the ramp in no time. The buildings trembled with the explosion, and the necks of the onlookers turned swiftly towards one direction.
The machine ran up the ramp in an instant, and leaped against the wind while spouting out smoke from its rear.
Kino lost sight of the flying machine amidst the smoke. By the time the wind cleared up the fumes, she found its tiny form with the blue sky as its backdrop. The pipes that no longer emitted fumes became dislodged and fell away. It fell on the marshland outside the country, piercing into the slushy earth.
When it was almost invisibly small, it made a turn and returned towards the country and became bigger and bigger in view.
Soon, the people craning their necks into the sky gathered on the road. Everyone except for Kino had their mouths wide open in shock. They muttered simultaneously.
“It flew. That heavy thing is in the sky…”
“The machine is flying…”
“I don’t believe this… it’s impossible… but…”
“A human… flying…”
Kino, who had a smile on her face since Nimya dove to the sky, asked Hermes, “Any thoughts?”
“I’m a bit jealous. That’s all.”


Meanwhile, Nimya was yelling to the top of her voice.
“What now?! Didn’t it fly?! It is flying! I was not wrong! Not my calculations, not my experiments! Nothing was a waste!”
Then the flying machine suddenly ascended even more, and just as it is, turned in the air.
“It’s working perfectly! It can be maneuvered flawlessly! I was not wrong!” With utmost faith in her machine, Nimya turned in the air many times over, flying up and down and making abrupt turns again and again.
Eventually, it settled down with Nimya muttering.
“Ugh. I feel sick…”


“Everyone!”
Kino suddenly called out to the enthralled citizens.
“For the flying machine to land safely, it needs a long and perfectly straight road. If you wish to send back that person, who had done such a great deed, back to the ground, kindly move at least three of the statues. It will be even more helpful if you move four of them.”
“U-understood! Right away!” The chief said with several nods.
“Everyone! Those statues are in the way! Move them, quickly!”
On the command of the chief, the people snapped back into reality and quickly took action. Using Nimya’s crane truck, the bronze statues were rooted out, foundation and all. Then the planks used for the ramp were laid out above the holes. In their panic, they moved away seven statues.
In no time, they completed a long and perfectly straight path, on both sides of which gathered numerous people.
Soon the flying machine glided down to the main road. It lowered down slowly; its three tires touched the ground at the same time, then its engine stopped.
The machine ran from the momentum and stopped right before Kino.
The crowd timidly surrounded the machine. As Nimya took off her goggles and stood up from the cockpit, a noiseless stir spread through the crowd. Kino and Hermes watched from behind.
“Nimya…” The first to speak was her fiancée.
“See, it’s just as I told you!” Nimya exclaimed happily, tapping the machine.
“Let’s go on our honeymoon with that. Let’s get married tomorrow!” The fiancée gently proposed as he looked up at Nimya.
“I didn’t know… you… no, everyone…” Nimya said doubtfully and her fiancée cried out.
“You’re a mage, aren’t you?!”
“Huh?”
“We didn’t realize it, and until now, we were acting foolishly and have been very rude to you. Please, forgive us helpless fools!”
“What?” As another question leaked from Nimya’s lips, her fiancée dropped on his knees before her.
Forgive us! We’re sorry! Please forgive us! Our apologies! Pardon us! We beg your forgiveness! We apologize! Sorry! Sorry! SORRY!
The people dropped to their knees one after another. It was like a spreading ripple, with Nimya and the flying machine at its center.
“Eh? W-wait, everyone!” Nimya became flustered.
“Lady Nimya! Oh, great mage! We truly regret our actions!” The chief, on his knees like the rest, pleaded with only his face raised.
“Please guide these helpless beings with your power! By the authority vested upon me as this country’s leader, I hereby proclaim you governor! Please accept it.”
“……”
While Nimya received expectant gazes from the chief and the citizens, Kino was busy packing her luggage on Hermes.
Someone noticed her and talked to her with an equally eager tone. “Great traveler! Could it be that you are a mage as well? If so, then by all means——” 
“No, thank you! I’m about to go!” Kino said decisively as she tied her luggage firmly to Hermes.
Kino fixed her hat and strapped on her goggles. Nimya got off the machine and approached Kino. The crowd parted to make way for her.
Kino spoke to Nimya, “We’re going to leave right now.”
“Eh? But, wait——” Nimya asked in surprise.
“I’m really sorry. I have to go. Things might get complicated…. By the way, congratulations.”
“Congratulations. That was very impressive!”
Nimya looked around her and took a big breath. Then she looked back at Kino and Hermes, “You have my gratitude. This is all thanks to you.” And with solemn eyes, “…It may only be chance or a whim that brought you to this country, but for me, it’s fate. If it weren’t for you, the machine would have been destroyed, and I would have lived the rest of my life in disappointment… I’m serious. Words can’t express how grateful I am to you.”
Nimya smiled and stretched out her hand. Kino gripped the hand offered to her, and once more,
“Congratulations. …I had so much fun.”
“Me too. …Take care.”
Nimya did not take away her glance from the motorrad until it vanished at a bend in the road. Then she gazed at her followers prostrate before her, and muttered,
“Then, what should I do from now on?”


Kino and Hermes passed through the unmanned gates and came out of the country.
It was filled with swamps like before, but not as muddy. It was much more easier to run through it than when they first came. Hermes spoke happily as the gates got smaller behind them.
“Wow, that was amazing! Just look at those surprised faces! They were like peas hit by a dove shooter!”
“…Doves hit by a peashooter?”
“Yeah, that’s it,” Hermes said and fell silent.
And the motorrad continued to make its way through the marshland.
After a while, Kino broke the silence. “Even so, that was unexpected. I was really surprised.”
“Wasn’t it? They shouted ‘Mage! Please forgive us!’ out of nowhere. It will take a while before the misunderstanding gets cleared. I’m sure a statue will be erected for her very soon,” Hermes said, and now it was Kino who turned mute.
“…Nope. I wasn’t referring to that…”
“Eh? What do you mean?” Hermes probed into Kino’s ambiguous reply.
“I didn’t think that machine could really fly,” Kino answered.
“Kino… what did you just say?”
“I said, I didn’t think that there could be one — a machine that could fly. I understood the theory she explained to me, but I didn’t believe it was possible…. It was really amazing.”
For a while, only the hum of the motorrad’s well-regulated engine could be heard. The waterfowl at the side of the roads let out choking cries, and flew away all at once.
“Kino! Then why did you cooperate in the first place?”
Hermes’ question was met with an impassive response. “Why? Well, if it worked I would see something interesting. If it didn’t, that person would probably give up. Besides…”
“Besides?”
“I was bored.”
Dead silence. After a while, Hermes asked reluctantly, “…T-then, assuming you weren’t bored in that country, would you have helped her?”
“I may not have. Why, under normal circumstances, if you told me a thing like that could fly, I wouldn’t have believed you.”
“……”
And Kino dealt the final blow to the speechless Hermes. “It really flew — just like magic.  To see something that amazing was worth going through all that mud. …What’s wrong, Hermes?”
“Oh, nothing. I was just pondering over the range of potential human beings have.”
“Uh-huh…”
Kino replied half-heartedly to Hermes’ serious ramblings as they leisurely traversed the road by the side of the swamp.

5th of Doe, Year 893

TRAVELER SHOT MAN, THE POLICE DEEM SELF-DEFENSE
The 4th. Daytime. At West 56th Street, a traveler (age unknown) who entered the city two days before, shot a businessman (age, 55), inflicting severe injuries. The police recognized that it was an act of self-defense on the part of the traveler, who was able to leave the borders that evening. Police will further discuss enforcement of laws regarding self-defense and persuader ownership.

MALE BUSINESSMAN WOUNDED SERIOUSLY FOR “SUSPECTED THEFT”
Morning of the 4th, around 11:29. On 56th Street in the western district, a visiting traveler who entered the city two days before got into an argument with a male company executive who wished to take a closer look at the traveler’s motorrad. When the man tried to approach, the traveler quickly shot him twice with a persuader, hitting him in the right shoulder and right leg. The man was immediately taken to a nearby hospital by medics but would require a full month to recover from his severe injuries.
The traveler stayed for police interrogation, where the traveler claimed self-defense against the company executive, who allegedly attempted to steal the motorrad. The police accepted the explanation, and the traveler was allowed to leave the country the same evening without any further incident.
The case took place in the crowded shopping district in front of the western gate, causing quite a commotion among the onlookers. Luckily, no one else was hurt by stray bullets.
In relation to “justifiable self-defense”, there was a case four days ago in the southern district where a policeman fired without warning at a young man who attacked his fellow police officer. The young man died from 14 bullet wounds. The police also deemed the shooting as an act of self-defense, but many who believed that it was an act of police brutality took to the streets in protest. (See page 39 for details.)

STREET KILLINGS? THE TRAGEDY OF “SELF-DEFENSE” SHOOTINGS
A peaceful street was disturbed by a loud gunshot, followed by cries of panic. All this happened in broad daylight and in plain view of pedestrians.
At the scene, a man was found curled up on the pavement, his shoulder and leg bleeding profusely. A frantic young woman was at his side providing medical assistance. Witnesses reported that the traveler with the smoking persuader did not act to aid the wounded man, but merely stood and looked on coldly.
The 55-year old man is a company executive from a leading medical equipment firm. On the day of the incident, the man was visiting the area for business reasons. He was dining with his colleagues at a nearby restaurant before the shooting occurred.
According to his colleagues’ statement, the man was engaged in lively conversation when he noticed the parked motorrad by the street. He purportedly remarked that it was “a nice motorrad.” Its owner appeared shortly and sternly warned the man to stay away from the motorrad.
Although the man gently rebuked the young traveler for his tone, the traveler paid no heed and shouted at the man to stay away from the motorrad. When he attempted to step closer, the traveler open fired without warning. The man was wounded in his right shoulder and right leg, and the pain caused him to collapse onto the pavement.
He was immediately sent to a hospital to undergo an emergency surgery, but due to the severity of his wounds, it would take at least a month for him to completely recover. The shot to the leg was particularly treacherous, narrowly missing major arteries by a few inches. The lead surgeon commented that if the shot was any closer, it would have sent him into a critical condition. The trauma from the injuries affected the man’s memory of the incident.
The man’s family also gave their statements about the incident. Unable to hide their disbelief, one of them remarked: “How could something like this happen?” Later that evening, upon learning that the police had marked the case as rightful self-defense and allowed the traveler to exit the borders, the family member was outraged further into saying, “Even though he (the man) had done nothing wrong, he was shot, while the shooter was able to walk off scot-free! This is unjust!” The man’s attorney expressed, “We can’t let the police continue with their tyranny.” They are considering filing charges against the police who resolved the case as a mere act of self-defense.

EXPERTS’ VIEW
JUSTIFIABLE SELF-DEFENSE WILL BE THE DOWNFALL OF THIS NATION 
(Tony Methone - Former Judge of the South District Court)
I believe that the traveler had chosen to fire unnecessarily. It would not be hard to imagine that the traveler believes himself to be above the law and beyond retribution, just because of the fact of him being a foreigner. To shoot a citizen without provocation tells us that the traveler is a bloodthirsty fiend. It greatly disappoints me that the traveler was not arrested and brought to a court of law. This was indeed a failure for the nation.

TOLERANCE TOWARDS SHOOTING INCIDENTS
(Nihal Ruthbator - Chairman of Citizen’s Eye on the Police)
Lately, there have been many cases where the police use rightful self-defense as an excuse for shooting incidents. Since the fatal shooting four days before, persuader ownership and the definition of self-defense have been a hot topic on everyone’s lips. Now with the latest shooting, I can’t help but think that this is too great a coincidence. Could it be that someone is manipulating the situation behind the scenes? The traveler probably was in no danger of being arrested in the first place. The traveler could be getting paid for his involvement this very moment just beyond the border!

READER’S REVIEW CORNER
STRICTER IMMIGRATION INSPECTIONS
(Betty Teteths — Female, Age 28, Homemaker)
“Ouch! Ouch!”
Was my first response when I heard about the west district shooting on the radio. The one where a man was badly wounded by a traveler with a persuader.
I also heard there was an uproar over the police’s decision regarding the shooting. But what troubles me is how someone like that could be allowed to enter our border? I demand that the immigration office take responsibility!
For us law-abiding citizens, to own a persuader would require a strict background check, especially for small firearms. Yet, this traveler who openly displays a persuader was allowed to enter the border. I was even more shocked to learn that the traveler was allowed to leave the country on the same day after the incident. It pains me to hear the situation of the hospitalized man.
When the news was released, I was called back to reality by my 5-year-old son. He was asking me with a serious face, “Where did it hurt, Mommy?” I hurriedly told my boy, “Don’t worry, mommy’s fine now.” To think that my dear boy would be worried about me, it fills me with tears. As I hold him tightly, my heart is filled with rage towards the callous traveler. To let someone so dangerous enter our country armed is a huge mistake! For the safety of my child, I hope immigration will impose stricter regulations.

“PLEASE THROW AWAY YOUR PERSUADER, TRAVELER”
(Anne Yelets — Female, Age 7, Grade school student)
Something bad happened near my home: a man who was looking at a motorrad was shot by the owner, hurting the man’s shoulder and leg.
Why would the traveler do that? I don’t understand why.
“He was trying to steal my motorrad,” the traveler said. But I think the man just wanted to take a closer look at the beautiful motorrad. I think the man must be really hurt, and his parents must be hurt too. Can’t the traveler feel their pain? I believe the traveler has a waiting mommy and daddy at home, too; how would the traveler feel if they were hurt? I would like to know.
Persuaders are bad things that are used to hurt and kill people and animals. I wish they would disappear so that no one will get hurt again. Please throw away your persuader, traveler. And please have a heart for others.

ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF COMPETITIONS’ CLOSED-DOOR SCREENING
(Eliza Blau - Female, Age 64, Homemaker)
A few days back, this paper announced the results of the naming contest of a 2-month-old forest panda. I too have participated in the contest and eagerly awaited the result.
To conjure up the serene image of adorable pandas living peacefully in the lush green forest, I named the newborn “Woods”. A simple name that even children can easily pick up, yet still carries the majesty of the forest, I believe there can be no better name than this and was very confident with the contest.
But my heart sank when the results were announced.
Not only did my submission not make it into the consolation, the biggest shock was that the winning name was “Woody”, a mere single character’s difference from mine. I would not have minded so such if they were both vastly different, but this result makes me doubt the decision of the panel of judges.
The winning name came from a 17-year-old girl from the northern district. Could a girl shallow in life’s experiences come up with a winning name?
I know that my suspicion seems beastly, but I think the panel of judges took my submission and altered it slightly. Pretending it was submitted by the pre-selected girl, they announced her as the winner.
There have been previous cases of corruption between the organizer and the judging party, and it would be hard to warrant that such handy-party did not happen this time also.
So, for future contests such as this, there should be a neutral third party audit overseeing the process much like the Anti-Corruption Agency for the government.

TRAVELER SHOT MAN, THE POLICE DEEM SELF-DEFENSE
On the 4th, a traveler (age unknown) who entered the border two days earlier, shot a man at West 56th Street in broad daylight. The man (age, 55) was reportedly fiddling with the traveler’s motorrad. As the man refused to stop even after repeated warnings, the traveler fired his persuader out of necessity. Police deemed the shooting as a case of legal self-defense, and the traveler was able to leave the country the same evening.

ATTEMPTED THEFT? MAN RECEIVES MINOR WOUNDS
At around 11:29 on the morning of the 4th, on West 56th Street, a traveler who entered the country for sightseeing found a man trying to mount a motorrad that belonged to him without permission. The traveler issued several verbal warnings to the man, but he was too drunk to take heed and replied with threats. When the man grabbed the traveler, the traveler was forced to shoot him with a persuader (a .22 automatic) twice. The man was hit in the right shoulder and right leg and was rushed to the hospital with minor wounds. Doctors reported that recovery would take no more than a week.
The traveler was questioned by officers at the scene, and after collecting reports from witnesses, the police deemed the traveler acted in self-defense and was released from custody and allowed to pass through the border that evening. According to the police, the traveler held no grudge towards the country for this incident.
The man was under the influence of alcohol during the incident and was unable to recall what happened after he was sent to the hospital. He was given a stern warning by the police.
Crime is on the rise in our nation, and it has become a serious concern. Four days before in the southern district, there was a case of a drug addict injuring his physician-in-charge to escape the hospital. He later attempted to take a patrolling police’s persuader by force with a knife, and another officer was forced to shoot the addict to avoid a catastrophe. (More detail in Local News Section)

ARROGANT BEHAVIOR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL; NO CHARGES FILED
At the time, the man probably thought he was allowed to do whatever pleased him. He meddled with another person’s possession, attempting to handle and operate a motorrad without permission from its owner.
The thing of note in yesterday’s incident was that the man was clearly intoxicated and was barely standing when he was shot by the traveler.
He was participating in a company function at a nearby restaurant. According to restaurant staff, they had been drinking a lot and were being loud and disrespectful to other patrons. One of the staff who tried to calm them down received a face full of vulgarity.
After the man left the restaurant, the motorrad caught his attention and he immediately went to it, grabbing the handles and knocking on the gas tank. He was on the verge of hopping onto the motorrad when the traveler returned carrying fresh sandwiches for lunch.
The collection of witnesses reported that the traveler was being tactful with the encounter, but the man would have none of it, spouting phrases such as, “You’re not the boss of me!”, “I once rode something like this, so this is mine!”, “Show your respect, youngster, and get lost!” and more unintelligent babble. The traveler continued to request that the man leave the motorrad several times in a cool and calm voice, but the man somehow took offense at the traveler’s tone and kicked the motorrad several times. He also repeatedly threw curses and tried to grapple the traveler. This is when the traveler was forced to shoot him.
Even though the bullet hit him in the shoulder, the man continued to yell and stagger toward the traveler, forcing another shot to the leg from the traveler to finally stop his rampage.
Examination reports from the hospital tell us that the persuader used was of low caliber range, and would not be fatal as long as it did not hit the head or chest. In the man’s case, the wounds he received clearly show that the traveler is a highly-skilled persuader-user, as he was able to avoid major arteries and bones.
Being the victim of this incident, the traveler was released and allowed to leave the country that evening. No charges were pressed against the man, thus no punishment was issued and his name was not revealed.
But that was probably not the end; the rampaging of drunks might not only cause trouble to travelers but could also quite possibly harm citizens.

EXPERTS’ VOICE
THE CAUSE AND EFFECT OF SELF-DEFENSE SHOOTINGS
(Ole Tucker - Retired Director of Ministry of National Defense)
The traveler acted to protect the safety of his life and property, a fully understandable act of self-preservation. The man had been messing with the traveler’s property and chose to ignore repeated warnings by the traveler. Witnesses of the incident point out that the man was shouting gibberish and was prepared to attack the traveler. Under no circumstance should violence be used as a solution, but I would like to applaud the experienced and cool-headed officer for classifying this incident as legal self-defense.

INTENSIFY ALCOHOL INTOXICATION LAWS
(Timothy Tenostor — Chairman of “Parents Who Lost Children to Alcohol Abuse”)
“Lawless, shameful and childish” might be the words the traveler would think of at the mention of this nation. If he or she were to be further charged with criminal offenses, that would truly be tragic. I wish to applaud our police force for their correct decision, for we always turn a blind eye to drunks. Now is the time to face this growing social issue! Including the problem of underage drinking, laws against alcoholism need to be enforced now before our children become the next victims because by then it will be too late.

CITIZENS’ OPINION
ONE STEP AWAY FROM VICTORY
(Eliza Blau - Female, Age 64, Homemaker)
A few days back, this paper announced the results of the naming contest of a 2-month-old forest panda. I too have participated in the contest and eagerly awaited the result.
To conjure up the serene image of adorable pandas living peacefully in the lush green forest, I named the newborn “Woods”. A simple name that even children can easily pick up, yet still carries the majesty of the forest, I believe there can be no better name than this and was very confident with the contest.
But my heart sank when the results were announced.
Not only did my submission not make it into the consolation, the biggest shock was that the winning name was “Woody”, a mere single character’s difference from mine. I have participated in similar public contests before, and this was the first where I was so close to victory, making the defeat all the more bitter.
But I will not give up and will use this experience as a drive to perform better next time, even if my friends call me stubborn and out of league. (Editorial department: An edit has been made.)

“ARMED EQUALS VILLAIN” MENTALITY
(Norgen Heidini — Male, Age 76, Unemployed)
There was a case of a shooting on the 4th involving a man and a traveler, and when I heard the man’s family attempted to sue the police force for their decision, it filled me with disgust.
The man was drunk in broad daylight, disturbing other’s property, and was ignoring warnings from the owner while being aggressive towards him. It boggles my mind that the man still thinks he is innocent and not in the wrong. I would very much like to see the people who raised this brute!
Some might think the traveler had murder in mind, but the traveler only shot him in the shoulder and leg after repeated warnings. As someone who has served forty years in the police force on the front lines against crime, if murder was the motive, the traveler would have aimed for the head or chest instead. If we were to frame the traveler as a criminal just because of the shooting, that would have been a grave mistake.
Can we afford to hide our heads and assume that “all those who use weapons, e.g. persuaders, are bad guys,” making judgments without considering the circumstances? Imagine you are caught in this situation; what actions would you take? I hope everyone would cool their heads and not overreact over this incident.

TRAVELER’S ACTION REMINDS ME OF A DARK PAST
(Anonymous — Female, Age 30, Company Employee)
The incident reminds me of something that happened to me before.
I was sexually assaulted by a drunk when I was fifteen.
Although it was broad daylight, a red-faced drunk in his 50’s suddenly grabbed me on the street. I wasn’t even able to scream out of panic. The man continued to grope me, and with his breath stinking of alcohol, he spat obscenities at me before staggering off laughing.
It was several hours later before my mother found me crying by the street, and took me to the hospital, reporting the incident to the police.
The police brought the man shortly, and in my rage and shame, I vowed to bring him to justice. So I identified him as the culprit. But the man proclaimed loudly, “I am the headmaster of a renowned high school, there is no way that I could have done this! If you continue this nonsense, I will sue you and your parents for defamation of character!”
Suffice to say, he was released due to lack of evidence. He left not before hurling more obscenities and threats, and my father later found out that the man truly was as he said, a headmaster of a renowned high school and quite high up in the education ministry.
When he passed away several years later, rumors of his past started to surface. That he could not hold his liquor and had repeatedly used obscenities in PTA meetings. But I don’t wish to dig up filth on a dead man since I have no proof that the incident even took place.
I just wish to express my admiration to the officer who decided to let the traveler go.


“——and that’s it, Hermes.”
Someone spoke in the middle of a desert.
She sat on a sea of hardened sand that spread out in all directions. The sun was setting in the west, staining the earth and sky a bright orange.
She was about fifteen, with a mop of short black hair. Large eyes adorned her fearless face, and she wore a black jacket over her shoulders, a simple but thick belt around her waist, and a holster containing a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) over her right thigh.
In her hands was a newspaper that she had just finished reading out loud, and scattered all around her were more newspaper sheets that she had finished perusing.
Parked nearby was a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly).
A rifle-type persuader was leaning against the motorrad, next to a large travel bag.
Hermes, the motorrad, happily chirped in. “A persuader-user who travels on a motorrad? That sounds just like you Kino! I bet anyone who has read the news would have gone ‘Oh! That’s Kino!’”
The girl named Kino smiled sourly and said, “You are being rude…. I would never open fire on a street like that.”
“Oh well, maybe.” Hermes paused and asked, “Why do you think the fellow opened fire?”
She stared at the dipping sun in the far horizon and answered honestly.
“I don’t know. I can’t make a sound conclusion from these reports. He might be a trigger-happy sadist who likes to taunt his victims, or he could be a man of justice who only retaliates when forced. Or he could be both.”
“Is that so… but Kino, have you realized the most critical thing that is missing from all of these reports?”
“Hm? What?” Kino tilted her head to one side with a look of confusion. Hermes quickly solved the mystery himself.
“The motorrad’s side of the story, of course! They never bothered to interview the biggest witness to the incident! And they call this unbiased reporting?”
Hermes continued to fume, while the orange in the sky was slowly replaced by shades of purple, with stars beginning to appear.
Kino removed a blanket from the luggage and laid it out on the ground, then put on her brown coat. She picked up the rifle that was leaning on Hermes and checked its chamber to see whether it was loaded. After readjusting the scope on the persuader, she laid it down next to the rug.
“Why do you carry those newspapers anyway?” The question suddenly popped into Hermes’ mind.
“The news is just a coincidence… as to why,”
Kino started to remove single sheets of paper from the stack, and twisted them as if drying a towel, then laid them out in a sunburst formation.
“When there’s no firewood around, they become a useful replacement.” Kino lit a match with a single stroke on her boot, and as she let the tiny flame lick the newspapers,
“What’s printed on them doesn’t matter.”


Under the deep, starry purple sky, the earth was pitch black.
Except for a tiny dot of light.














"
35,v5c1,5,1,"Hey, Kino. Is there really a country here?”
Hermes asked Kino this while he ran.
“Dunno…”
She cocked her head as she replied.
Kino and Hermes were in a desert. The hard-packed white earth stretched from horizon to horizon, as far as the eye could see.
Clouds covered the sky without fail; a single white sheet. A white sky and a white earth. The farther you looked, the blurrier the distinction between the two. In such a blank world stood a lone motorrad.
Kino wore her yellow goggles and a bandana was wrapped around her face. She also had a long, brown coat on, with the excess of the long hem rolled up to her thighs.
“Whaddya mean, Miss Dunno?”
“Actually, I don’t even know why I’m even driving here. It’s strange.”
“I knew it. Well, it’s camel flag around here, I guess.”
“…I think you mean camouflage.”
“Yeah, that’s it! —Nice work.”
“Uhm, but… What is this ‘camouflage’ for?”
“If we go along further, we’ll figure it out.”
As Hermes said these things and made Kino tip her head again, she drove along. The scenery hardly changed, so it became even more doubtful whether they were moving at all. When some time passed in this manner,
“Ah…”
This was what Kino found.
It was a very big sign. Half-buried and slanting in the white desert. There were huge letters inscribed on it—
Kino stopped Hermes before the sign. She let down the kickstand and got off, wobbling over to it,
“Uuugh…”
And at length sunk down to her knees. On the sign was written thus:
“The afterword of Volume X begins here, so best regards.”
‘How can this be?’ Kino muttered as she beat her gloved fists into the white desert.
“‘So this was an afterword! —dammit, that blasted author did it after all!’”
So Hermes yelled enjoyably for and behind Kino. And then it whispered quietly.
“An afterword all of a sudden in the book—it’s within the expectations of many readers, though. This is just one of them.”
“Not only in the last volume but this one, too—how can he do this to a character?!”
Kino became angry, but we’ll ignore that as the afterword begins.


Okay, so, the afterword.
As usual, no spoilers. Reading this before the subsequent stories in this book is fine, too.
So now Kino’s gone up to X.
“Volume 10” is just one word, but since the year 2000 when the first volume went on sale, six years have passed. So if you’ve been reading since you were in sixth grade, you’re a high school senior, now. Amazing. As for me, it’s been a plentiful six years of experience and growth, I believe.
In all that time, Kino got a drama CD, an anime, video game, a signing at Entama, an anime movie in theaters, a speech on that stage, a signing in Taiwan, a second game—lots happened.
That a manuscript initially entered into the Dengeki Game Novel Prize came this far is because of the support of all of you, readers.
I am grateful once again as I reach this turning point of a tenth volume. Thank you.
However…I must deliver some very disheartening news.
I’ve started to run out of material for the Kino series.
I’ve been doing my best writing this far, but…I can’t go on any longer.
I can’t think of any more…
Interesting afterwords!

36,v5c2,5,2,"This story takes place in the dining hall of a hotel of a country.
The dining hall took up the first floor of the wooden building. The floors were paneled with wood, the walls likewise, and wide beams crossed the high ceiling.
Between each beam, as well as between the beam and the wall, hung thick ropes.
They were the kind you could find on sailing vessels. Tens dangled low enough to touch a person’s head.
About twenty round tables were arranged on the floor. Only one had chairs, and it was there where four travelers had gathered.
All of them just came into the country that day.
One was a man in his fifties, traveling by coach.
One was a woman in her thirties going around in a four-wheel drive.
One was a youth in his twenties who befriended the woman and got a ride, but otherwise went on foot.
The last was a short-haired teenager with a large revolver hung by the hip who rode a motorrad. (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only denotes that it doesn’t fly.)
After the four took their meals, they had their usual information exchange as they sipped tea. No other customers were present. Even the bartender was not at the back counter. And then,
“There’re travelers here!”
The residents gathered round, talking loudly. All at once, some thirty people crowded around the surprised guests.
After exchanging simple greetings, one countryman said this.
“Say, travelers. When you guys say stuff like, ‘These are the places I’ve seen up until now’ and people don’t believe you because they’ve got no way of checking the facts, you end up having to lie to satisfy them, right? So how about it? Tell us what kind of lies you make up when that happens. Something very imaginative, full of strange things that aren’t possible in reality—we’d like to hear those.”
This surprised the travelers, but if you were told that the meals would be free of charge if each one shared such a story, how could you keep quiet?


The old man spoke.
“This, I once saw. In one country, everybody was a tub of lard—so obese that you’d think they weren’t human. Beauty and fat went hand-in-hand in their minds, I suppose, but anyhow, they pigged out every day. Obesity-related diseases manifested one after the other in them, but they didn’t care one bit. And when they finally got to the point where they can’t walk anymore, they were hailed as ‘saints’, taken care of by someone, and led a life wholly devoted to eating until death. Body weight always exceeded 300 kg. The sheer load causes the flesh to separate from the bone, so that’s how they can’t move. Such things can’t be called human.”


The woman spoke.
“The country that surprised me the most would have to be this one. Its custom was to lop off a baby’s arm or leg once it was born. They considered having a full set of limbs too perfect and how ‘it wasn’t beautiful for a human’ so they simply cut one off. They were even selling tools for that. Of course, that meant everyone there was missing an arm or a leg, and since it was their standard of beauty all this time, wherever I went, they always asked me with a frown, ‘Aren’t you ashamed to have all of your arms and legs?’ And eventually they got this close to cutting something off of me, so I shot off.”


The youth spoke.
“The one I went to was amazing. They had a law called the Middle Age Act. It says that if middle-aged people—adults who’ve developed their judgment—commit a crime, they’re innocent. As long as they agree to some simple reformation, they won’t be put in jail. It seems that their justification is this: ‘For such sensible adults to have committed the crime, they surely must have had no choice at the time. Hence, they cannot be charged with the crime.’ So there was a proverb like this in that country: ‘If you’re going to commit a crime, wait until middle age.’ Of course, most of the adults there were normal, but outrageous crimes cropped up every so often and gave me the creeps. I left pretty soon.”


The motorrad rider spoke.
“I once saw an entire land moving. It was about the size of this country we’re in, though beneath the huge walls were millions of caterpillars that never stopped moving. The people lived above them and traveled leisurely like that. When I got on, there was another country blocking its way, but the moving country used high-power lasers that burned through the walls like paper and reflected every missile that came its way, so it went on in a matter of minutes. Even now, I believe that country must be wandering somewhere.”


The stories were finished.
The stories highly amused the residents, whose eyes opened wide, laughed and exclaimed, “There’s no way that could ever be real!”
So they thanked the travelers for the good time. ‘We’ll go pay the meal costs now, and the morning is nigh, so we’ll be taking off,’ they said.
Just like the way they came, they left in an instant.
The four sat there all alone. To break the sudden silence in the dining hall, the old man spoke.
“Everyone— You thought that thinking up of a lie was too much trouble, and ended up telling your real experiences in the places you visited, didn’t you?”
The other three nodded. As they stared at the old man,
“Yeah. So did I.”
He matter-of-factly confessed the same. And then,
“Although the places we spoke of earlier were shocking…”
The three nodded. Then all four looked up at the hanging ropes.
“This country is quite amazing itself.”
And the three firmly nodded to the old man’s murmur.
For the residents who had just been there were dangling upside-down from the ropes. All four continued staring up at the ropes.


At the bar counter, the bartender too hung upended from the rope tied to his knee.
“Would you like seconds?”
And asked this as he polished a glass.


"
37,v5c3,5,3,"One summer, there was a tiny car running on a prairie.
It was flat all around as far as the eye could see. The flowering plants danced comfortably with the wind, and there were but a few trees. The clouds scattered in the sky sparkled a bright orange from the glow of the evening sun.
The vehicle that made its way through this plain was a very tiny, yellow rundown car. One would think that its exhaust pipe, which spouted black fumes and rattled with each bump on the rough road, could fall off at any moment. Through its cracked side mirror, the rust-colored and fragmented corners of the car’s hood could be seen.
Nevertheless, the car ran with all its might through the enormous grassland.
As it was summer, the air was warm in itself. But the climate in these parts was not humid, so crossing this place was not a grueling task. The man seated in the driver’s seat, as well as the woman in the left-hand  
passenger seat enjoyed the gentle wind coming in through the window, their shirt collars swaying with the breeze.
While keeping one hand on the steering wheel, the slightly short but handsome young man in the driver’s seat spoke to the woman beside him, “Master, don’t you want to rest? Once we get to the country, that is.”
The woman with long black hair, the one who the man referred to as Master, returned a question without looking back at the man.
“And what do you mean by ‘rest’?”
“Why, just as it says on the tin. We’ll take a break from work and spend our time in the country relaxing. With that gem we got from the trader, we don’t have to worry about food expenses for a while.”
The woman did not say anything, but did not seem to be against the idea either.
“I would also like to savor three delicious meals a day for once.”
At the same time as the man’s words, the walls appeared from the bottom of the horizon.
The car feebly made its way to the walls. On both sides of the road, they could see something moving.
The man slowed down the car. The things that stirred in the meadows were animals.
It was around sixty centimeters in length. At a glance, it seemed to be a penguin, having the appearance of a bird that walks, but it had two arms like that of a monkey.
Its color was a mottled brown and cream, with fur like that of a cat and tail like that of a dog. Its face resembled a tiny bear, with its nose right in between its beady eyes.
“Oh, it’s my first time seeing something like that,” the man said. The woman remained silent, but poked her head out of the car and looked at the animal.
While being watched by around thirty such creatures, the car disappeared beyond the gates.


The place the two arrived in was neither big nor small. Its main industry was agriculture, and as it has no nearby enemies, it was a rather laid-back country.
Upon entering the country, the pair sold the gem and checked-in at a splendid hotel. After taking a long-awaited shower, they ate delicious food and spent their time relaxing.
The next day, while they were having their late breakfast in a sparsely occupied restaurant, an animal came in.
It was the same kind of animal that they saw outside the country. However, its color was slightly different; it was a mottled black and brown and had a more striking appearance.
This creature walked in brisk, small steps with its two legs. It approached the table where the two travelers were having their meal.
“So they can also be found inside the country. I wonder if it’s a pet?” the man asked.
“I don’t know,” the woman answered without much interest while she drank her tea.
The animal came up to the side of the man and hopped up. It landed on the table with its feet, then fixed its glittering gaze on the cream-filled pastry that the man picked up to eat.
“No, you don’t dare.” The man raised his right hand to drive it away when,
“Ah! Stop, traveler!”
The man suddenly stopped his hand on the waiter’s shout. The woman, her lips still on her cup, lifted her gaze.
And at that moment,
“Kyokyokyokyukyo”
The animal uttered these sounds, then jumped away after nimbly grabbing the pastry from the man’s hand. It started to eat the pastry, smearing its face with cream.
“Ah!”
It gobbled up the pastry while the man held his mouth open in disbelief. The waiter ran quickly towards them.
“Traveler, you mustn’t lay a finger on that animal.”
“Why?”
“Because we have a law that protects it.”
The waiter explained that this animal used to thrive in these areas. However, when people started to live in this country, its population dropped due to excessive hunting.
And just before it became extinct, the country passed a law to protect it. They gave it food, and soon its population grew.
To prevent its extinction, a law was passed forbidding everyone, without exception, from harming it. And so, no matter what it did, the people had no excuse to hurt it.
Even during the explanation, the animal indulged itself with the man’s share of the pastries, and at last when it has finished eating up everything,
“Kyokyakyakyukyukyukya?”
It opened its cream-smudged mouth and vocalized what seemed like a question. The man and the waiter remained mute, having no idea what it was trying to say.
The animal then looked at the woman’s plate. There was one more delicious-looking pastry left in it.
“Kyokyukyakyukyoo. Kyukyukyo”
The animal yammered, and stretched its hand towards the plate.
“Kyukya?”
Just before it snatched the pastry, it met gazes with the woman who was staring it down.
“Kyuki-…”
The animal averted its eyes.
And then it jumped off and ran to a different table at the other side of the room. It also climbed up and started to wolf down a barely-eaten pancake of one customer.
The middle-aged man let out a deep sigh, and stood up from his seat. He abandoned his half-eaten meal, and went out of the restaurant.
“It’s just as you see. In this country, you can’t hurt this animal. If you wounded this animal by chance, you will have to serve five years in jail, even if you are a traveler. If you killed it, you will have to face a life sentence. Be careful.”
“Wow.”
The man was in shock. And as he was not able to taste the pastry, he ordered one more from the waiter. However,
“I’m very sorry, but it’s sold out.”
The waiter bowed and left.
When the man saw the woman eating her share of the pastry,
“Can I have half, please?”
“No.”
The woman replied coldly.


After that, the pair came out for a stroll and looked around the country.
“Anyway, that’s one menace of an animal.”
Just as the man said, the animals all over the place behaved outrageously as if there was no one around.
One group crossed the street, causing the cars and carriages to stop. Another skillfully climbed a wall and threw away the hung laundry. Some ate and laid waste to the fruits in front of a store. And some left footprints on a table that was just cleaned. They scattered droppings just about everywhere, destroyed crops, and played with those that cannot be eaten.
There weren’t really much of them, but they’re not particularly rare, as they could be seen just about everywhere.
According to the citizens, perhaps because of recent success in breeding, their numbers have suddenly increased.
And then a few animals came and flocked around the strolling pair. However,
“Do you need something?”
The group left as soon as they met eyes with the woman. Then they set their sights on a girl walking on the other side of the street. They snatched the little girl’s bag and chucked it in the middle of the road. A truck passed and ran over it.
“How terrible… After being able to buy it at last…”
Seeing the flattened bag, the girl cried in anguish.
“Kyukyakyaakyukyo!” “Kyu-kyokyu!” “Kyakyukyokya!”
The animals cried out, as if they were laughing in glee.
“They choose their opponents wisely. Pretty smart, eh,” the man said.


That evening.
As the two relaxed in the hotel’s lobby, the middle-aged man who managed the hotel came to greet them. He gave a warm welcome to the travelers, who rarely come to their country, and served them some tea.
When the travelers told him that they planned to leave the next morning,
“This is a good country, so please come again,” he invited.
The woman talked about a traveler who once stayed in the hotel. It was a story from a long time ago, when this magnificent building was yet to be built. The owner pointed to a picture hanging from a very high place in the lobby.
It was an old-looking, black and white picture showing a young couple smiling brightly in front of a small building. The owner explained that it was a photo of his parents.
Several decades ago, his parents built a small inn in this country, and it has since then became a magnificent hotel. It was evident that he was very proud of it.
“That’s the only picture I have of them. It’s this hotel’s treasure.”
“I see it’s very important to you,” the woman said.
“Yes. That’s why I placed it in such a high place. I would really like to display it on top of the fireplace where it could be seen very well, but the circumstances in this country is not so favorable for that, you see,” the owner said with an intricate expression.


The next morning,
An incident occurred while the travelers were having their breakfast.
“Ah! Stop! Stop it!”
A man’s scream was heard from the lobby.
The male traveler raised his eyebrow, and several guests went to the lobby out of worry.
“That’s the owner wasn’t it?” the woman said, and stood as she wiped her mouth. The man also hurried to the lobby.
What they saw there was,
“Stop!”
The screaming owner, and
“Kyakyu!” “Kyakyakyu!” “Kyakyuukyukyokya”
Three creatures that were happily stomping on something.
“Kyukya!”
“Kyukyukyo!”
“Kyu-kyukyukyu!”
What the animals continued to stomp on, while they grunted as if conversing with each other, was the photo of the owner’s parents, which should have been hanging from a high place.
The animals trampled on the picture frame, and as if that was not enough, they stepped on the picture and dirtied it with their drool and droppings.
“…”
The owner sank down to the floor right in front of them, and could only stare at the treasured picture that has turned into a sloppy mess.
“How come?”
The man tilted his head and looked at the wall where the picture hung. Then he noticed three long poles leaning against it.
“Oh dear…”
The female workers in the lobby told them that the animals came carrying those poles, propped them against the wall to climb up, and dropped the picture.
“Kya-kyukyaa!” “Kyukyokyuu!” “Kya!”
While the animals happily wrecked the photo,
“Ah…”
The guests could only look on silently at the owner who knelt before the scene as his eyes became flooded with tears.
“Kyakya?”
One of the animals trotted with its dirty feet to the guests, who drew back. They were grinding their teeth in frustration, but no one had the nerve to lay their hands on it.
“This country’s kings, huh?” the man muttered.
Soon this animal scampered in front of the woman. But it did not approach any more than necessary.
“Kya-kyakyu!”
It voiced out, and jumped up several times before returning to its fellow creatures still standing on the picture.
“Kyakyuu!” “Kyakyu!” “Kyaakyukya!”
The picture, which had no hope of getting mended, was further shred to pieces with the animals’ feet. The animals danced around as if in celebration.
And at that moment.
Bam.
A staggering roar shook the lobby.
All humans present except for one almost jumped in surprise. Likewise, all animals save for one almost jumped in surprise.
The lone person was the woman who had her smoking revolver poised by her waist.
And the lone animal was the one who received the bullet in its chest, blown away by a few meters, and collapsed with its face up. Blood spurted from its wound, and it has stopped moving except for a faint twitch. It was the animal that, only moments ago, mocked the woman.
“And here we go.”
The man mumbled to himself as he took out a slim automatic hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) with his left hand.
“Kyakyu?”
He switched on the laser sight, and the tiny circle of red light settled right in between its eyes.
Bang.
The animal flopped face up along with the firing sound that was much quieter than the first one.
Right before the dumbfounded guests and the only remaining animal.
“I’m sorry. My persuader fired by accident,” was the woman’s only explanation. The man also holstered his persuader and,
“Mine too. Oh, I’m really glad no one got hit.”
“T-travelers… This is…outrageous…”
At last one of the guests was finally able to say something.
“What are you talking about?”
“W-what… You just killed an animal protected under our laws… That’s a felony…”
“Animal?” The woman tilted her head innocently, and fixed her gaze at the two dead animals and the remaining animal frozen in shock. “Where is this animal you speak of?” she asked without hesitation.
A wave of comprehension swept the crowd.
“Where is this animal you speak of?”
She asked one more time.
“Yes, indeed…”
The owner stood up unsteadily.
“Kyu?”
“Everyone here… There’s not a single animal here, is there?”
“Kyukikyo…”
The owner wiped off the tears as he stood up, and lifted a chair by his side.
“DIE!”
And hit the remaining animal with all his strength.
“Kya—”
There was a tiny shriek, and the unpleasant sound of several bones breaking.


For a while, the owner continued to cry in front of the ruined picture.
“Oh my.”
The humans around gazed at the pair of travelers. The woman remained silent while the man only shrugged his shoulders.
Things like “What should we do?” or “Should we call the police?” could be heard among the crowd, but no one took initiative.
When the lobby has quietened down like a funeral service,
“Kyakyu?”
The door opened with a thud. Dozens of the animals entered the lobby. And upon seeing the corpses of their fellows,
“Kyakyu!” “Kyakyuu!” “Kyokyu!” “Kyaakyukyukyu!” “Kyakyu!”
They shouted out unanimously, and plunged themselves towards the humans.
Bam. Boom. Crack. Bang.
The pair of travelers pounded away like precision machinery. When the woman changed her magazine, the man would cover for her. And she would do the same when the man ran out of bullets.
The lobby was soon filled with sounds of explosions. After all the noise has subsided, there was not a single animal left moving.
The woman once again addressed the speechless crowd, “Where are the animals?”
“T-that’s right!” someone shouted. It was as if a switch was turned on.
“We have to protect the animals, but there’s not one of them here!”
“Yes, yes! —There are no such animals in this country!”
“And there’s no need to protect something that is not here!”
And everyone raised a cheer.


That day, the country experienced a day of celebration noisier than any they’ve had before.
“Have you seen any animals?”
“No, I haven’t.”
Such dialogue propagated like a wave throughout the country from the drop that originated in the hotel.
The citizens picked up bludgeons and farming tools.
“Kyakyuu!” “Gyokyu—”
And beat to death every single animal they could find.
At first the police considered doing something about it, but eventually, all of the citizens started doing the same thing, and they were forced to choose between arresting every single person in sight, or turn a blind eye to what they were doing.
“There aren’t any animals here…right, officer?”
“Yeah…there’s not one, inspector.”
And such was their choice.
“Kyukyukyaa-!”
The whole day, angry bawls and shrieks were heard throughout the country.
The travelers also took part with their recurrent accidental firings that hit ‘nothing’. And when they ran out of bullets, the stores gave them more for free.


And soon it was evening.
After being sent off with words of gratitude, the small, yellow car ran towards the gates.
There, the guard thanked them and invited them to come again. And the moment the car started to pass through the open gates,
“Kyakyuu!”
An animal hiding in the bushes jumped on the roof of the car.
“Ah! That basta— I don’t see anything!” the guard exclaimed and considered thrusting his sword to the top of the car. However,
“We’re leaving, so it’s okay,” the woman spoke, making the guard stop. At that moment, the car passed out of the gates.
“Well, since you’re out of the country now… Please take care,” the guard said before he returned to the gates.
“Master?”
The man in the driver’s seat set his gaze on the animal clinging desperately, and perhaps trembling in fear, at the roof,
“Kyukyukyuu…”
The woman asked the man to drive for a while, and as told, he rode the tiny car into the prairie. Then they stopped.
The woman alighted from the car and talked to the animal on top of the roof.
“Please get off.”
“Kyu-kyakyuu!”
“We can’t take you with us.”
“Kyukyukyu?”
“No.”
With the woman’s glare, the creature reluctantly jumped off the car’s roof.
“Kyukyuu…”
“It seems that you’ve misunderstood things a little.”
“Kyu?”
“‘Protection’ does not equate to ‘power’. The ones who have real control in that country were its people, not you.”
“Kyuu…”
“Now, go wherever you like.”
The woman pointed her finger to the prairie. The animal looked in that direction.
And over there, he saw many other animals. A group of around twenty animals of various sizes put out their heads from the grasses and looked back at them. It was the same kind, with only the color and size being slightly different.
“Kyu-kyukyu…”
“Goodbye,” the woman said and boarded the car and asked the driver to depart.
“Bye-bye,” the man said, before launching the sluggish car.


As they rode through the prairie road,
“I see you have a kind side too, Master. I thought you were going to kill it immediately like before.”
“No and no.”
Having heard the word ‘no’ twice, the man tilted his head in confusion.
“Master?”
He looked at the woman who sat on the left-hand seat. The woman was smiling.
“I’m not kind at all. And there was no need for me to kill it immediately.”


When the yellow car has left under the evening sun,
“Kyu-kyukyuu!”
The animal that was left behind looked at the group of animals.
“Gogagagagogaa” “Gogagagagago” “Gogogogogaga” “Goga-gagogaga!”
They communicated with domineering tones, and the lone creature replied,
“Kyoyu…”
And slightly drew back.
Then the one that seemed to be the boss of the group addressed it,
“Kyokyukyo?”
“Kyokyu-! Kyokyukyo-kyokyu!”
“Kyo-. Kyokyukyokyukyo”
Having said such, the boss turned back to its group.
“Gogagogogago!”
And spoke with a short yet mighty-sounding tone. Its peers tensed.
And then the boss,
“Kyokyukyo”
Spoke to the creature gently. It waved its hand, and invited it to come.
“Kyu! Kyuu—”
It replied happily, and approached the group. The group spread out and ushered in the newcomer.
And then,
“Gogagoo-!”
Within a moment, the boss began to beat up the lone creature together with everyone.
“Kyaakyuu! Kyakyuukyakyuu!”
The shrieks got louder, but they continued to beat it down without paying heed.
And soon, silence returned to the prairie.


"
38,v5c4,5,4,"Kino and Hermes were in a country.
Anywhere you were, you could see the border walls in the small, flat place. It was another one of those places with an alternating layout of houses and fields—a carefree scenery of a country just as carefree.
So that was how Kino was, cruising the place on Hermes under the warm sunlight when—
“Say, traveler. Would you like to have some tea and snacks with my family?”
She had no reason to refuse the passerby, so Kino let herself be treated.
Kino followed the countryman as she pushed Hermes along. She turned to enter the house grounds from the wide gravel road when—
“Oh, watch out there.”
He warned her. She stopped in her tracks and looked ahead, where a thick wire lay, stretching into the house.
“What is that?” she asked.
“Power lines,” he responded, “to connect the houses together. If you touch it, you get electrocuted and may die, so one must always be careful.”
“My, that’s serious.”
“But as long as you’re careful, you’re fine. Look at the end there.”
Kino and Hermes followed the line until it terminated at a pillar. It was very tall and pointed at the tip. They went the other way and sure enough, there was a pillar there, too, set in a very firm foundation made of stone.
“Huh—that’s true, you see these near lots of houses,” Hermes commented.
Then Kino asked what they were.
“Electric poles,” the countryman replied.
“Electric poles?”
“Yes, that’s right. Actually, a traveler like you came here many years ago and passed on the knowledge to us. Just like I did now, I cautioned her about the wires in the ground, but then she said, ‘Then just set up an electric pole between the wires.’ That was a brilliant idea. So we erected them up right away. Now whenever you see an electric pole, you know where the power lines are. No more need to look at the ground; ‘Oh, there’s an electric pole, so there must be power lines.’ The number of people electrocuted dropped down drastically.”


A few days after Kino and Hermes left.
“Ack…oh, no!” the countryman exclaimed. His neighbors asked him, ‘What’s wrong, what’s the matter?’
“We loathe the birds that eat the biting lice—our religious figure. So we couldn’t hang the electric wires up in the air because the birds will perch on them. And since we cannot put the wires underground because it is forbidden by law to dig in any place other than the farmland, we have no choice but to place them on top of the ground!” 
“Sure. What’s the big deal?”
“I forgot to say that! To the traveler and motorrad who were here days ago! They probably think we’re idiots, now! Absolute nincompoops!”
“Well, that’s not a problem. Travelers are travelers. They might come back again, but the chance of them not coming again is very high.”
“And I’m telling you, we lost the chance to correct that! What if they go to other countries and tell them about us? What if they all start thinking how stupid we must be?”
“Like I said, don’t worry about it. We don’t know everything about that traveler either, let alone other countries.”
“That’s…true, but…”
“No worries, no worries. Now, it’s time for prayer. —O sacred, sacred biting louse, bless us with your gift.”














"
39,v5c5,5,5,"My name is Riku. I am a dog.
I have long, white shaggy fur. My face makes me look like I’m always happy and smiling, but it doesn’t mean that I am. I was just born this way.
My master is Shizu. He is a young man who always wears a green sweater, and who has been traveling by buggy ever since he lost his homeland due to complex circumstances.


“I’ll leave everything to you then.”
Master Shizu set out early that morning, even before the sun has risen. Because the country we have come to this time was rather unstable and the public order pretty bad, he has given up on immigration. However, Master Shizu decided to accept a high-paying job for our traveling expenses. 
I did not ask him any details about this job, but seeing that he brought his well-maintained katana with him, it’s probably nothing decent. I did not pry.
But more than that, the problem is the white-haired girl who lay face down on the bed even at this hour—Tifana or Ti.  During our crossing to this continent, we were caught in various circumstances, and she has become our traveling companion as a result.
“I’m counting on you.”
So Master Shizu said, but to tell the truth, I was not too keen on this task.
For the whole day, it will only be Ti and me. Master Shizu is the one who is good in communicating with her. Surely I’m not expected to talk to her?


We were inside a room of a cheap hotel, an old decrepit building built in a place quite far from town.
The wallpaper of the room was peeled off all over the place and it was full of cobwebs when we entered it yesterday. The mattresses of the two beds even had holes in them. Right now Ti was sleeping on her own sleeping bag placed on top of a blanket that can’t be considered clean by any standard. Her usual grey short pants revealed her stick-thin legs, and on top she was wearing a light brown, long-sleeved round-necked shirt. Even though she has other clothes, this is all she ever wears in her sleeping and waking hours, as long as the temperature would allow it.
It was already late in the morning, halfway till noontime. If only she slept like this until evening, I would have nothing to worry about. But the moment it entered my mind, Ti woke up.
“…”
As quiet as ever, she raised her body as if she was doing a push-up. She stuck her upper body ten centimeters out of the sleeping bag. Then, like a fort’s cannon, slowly turned her white head towards the right. That is, towards me, who lay comfortably beside the bed.
Whether she was only sleepy or passing on me her usual silent judgment, her emerald green eyes stared at me for four seconds.
“…”
I rose up and sat beside the bed, then gazed firmly at Ti.
“Good morning.”
“…”
“Um, Master Shizu’s out to earn some money. If all goes as planned, he will be back late this night. So you will be spending the whole day with me.”
“…”
“You understand, don’t you? —Gah!”
I was hugged tightly by a Ti charging straight from the bed, and was knocked down to the left. Heavy…
Then she shook my body before abruptly releasing it after a few seconds.
I tried to ask her what that was all about, but since she probably wouldn’t answer anyway, I decided to forget about it. When I glanced up, she was looking at me. Then she spoke with a tiny voice.
“G’ning.”
And disappeared into the washroom.
It was only after several seconds that I realized that she was telling me ‘Good morning’.


Master Shizu left beforehand the croissant he bought last night, as well as a brand new bottle of marmalade.
Ti began eating these for breakfast and lunch. But I was flustered when I saw her scooping out a large portion of the orange marmalade with a big spoon.
It’s not a good idea to eat that much all at once. When I said so, Ti looked at the super large serving of marmalade and asked,
“Poison?”
I didn’t mean to put it that way.


Upon opening the curtains, the clear weather greeted us from outside the window. The early summer morning brought warmth upon the world.
From the window, we could see the geometric patterns formed by the ridges of the cultivated fields, in which grew carrots and whatnot. Visible beyond the scarecrows swaying with the wind was the sideways stretch of grey walls.
Ti leaned on a chair.
“…”
And continued to stare at the scenery for a long time. Meanwhile, I lay comfortably on top of the carpet beside her.
As the window was facing north, the sun’s rays were not too intense. Time flowed quietly like this, with no one speaking. And soon it was well past noon.
It would be nice if this day passed peacefully like this. But the moment the thought entered my mind, Ti suddenly got up.
“Going out.”
If only the thought did not occur to me.


“You can leave that behind, Ti.”
There’s no need to carry around a grenade with you on a stroll.
“…”
After staring at me for a while, she reluctantly returned the five grenades from her shoulder bag back to Master Shizu’s bag. I don’t know about casually leaving a grenade in her clothes pocket, but I guess it wouldn’t accidentally explode since she wound a tape around the lever. I thought it would be a good idea to do something about Ti’s attachment to grenades, but Master Shizu doesn’t really pay it any mind.
I proposed that she bring a bottle of water with her. Ti obediently followed, filling a plastic flask with water. She wrapped it in a towel and put it inside the bag. 
And finally Ti slung the bag on her shoulder. Clutching the key bearing Master Shizu’s memo: ‘Don’t forget when you go out,’ she approached the door.
When I followed her from behind, I noticed a very faint scent of oil from the bag.
“Ti, what did you put at the bottom of your bag?”
Ti took out a metal baton-like object.
“You can also leave that behind,” I said.
There’s no need to take a ballistic knife with you on a stroll.


“…”
“Little lady, I won’t understand you if you just stare. What do you need?”
Having grown tired of Ti’s stare, the middle-aged man seated in a tall chair behind the front desk who first looked back to us with a start from his magazine reading, asked. From behind, I told Ti that she had to hand over the key since we’re going out.
“…”
Without a word, she put the key on top of the table with a clunk.
“Ah, going for a walk, eh? Have a good time.”
“…”
But even after that, Ti continued to stare. And stared some more.
“Is there something else?” The man asked, again becoming impatient of the long silence. This time, Ti answered.
“Stroll.”
“… I know that already.”


Just as expected, there was nothing but fields outside. From time to time, trucks passed on the paved road that was full of cracks. Both sides of the road were lined up with fields. And until the walls there was nothing but fields.
“Where are we going?” I asked.
“…”
Silently, Ti headed to the direction of the walls, walking on the road headed northeast with the sun at her back. As she proceeded speedily, I followed.
When the road turned slightly to the right, it became clear that we have no particular destination, just as I suspected.
“The end.”
Ti said all of a sudden, and stopped on her tracks. When I asked ‘Of what?’ Ti gazed at her feet and tapped the ground with the tip of her shoes several times. Eventually, Ti’s shadow fell on the side of the road, on the grass-filled slopes of the fields, and became blurry and indistinguishable.
“Are you by any chance stomping on your own shadow?” I asked, and Ti looked at me and nodded.
“Shadow. Dark.”
“Well, that’s true, but…”
“Gone.”
“I can see that…”
“But it’s okay.”
“Ah, is that so…?”
“It’s okay now.”
“…”
“It’s okay.”
I don’t get it.


Ti turned back and retraced our steps, and walked beyond the hotel entrance.
The fields continued for a while up to the end of the road, and soon houses began to appear one after another. At the end of it, that is at the circular center of the country, a random ensemble of tower-like buildings could be seen rising above the urban area, which to my knowledge, has a rather bad public order.
We’d better not go that way. When I told her this,
“…”
Still quiet, Ti sat down on an old, neglected bench by the roadside. It probably used to be a bus stop. Only the round, concrete base of the signboard remained intact.
As Ti seated herself, I also settled by her side. The urban area was right before us. From time to time, Ti would take a gulp of water from her flask, and would also allow me to have a sip.
And until the evening rays of the sun dyed the sky, she patiently sat and gazed at the town. I don’t know what she finds enjoyable in it, but she just continued to look ahead.
And when the sun was almost invisible beyond the walls, and the moment the sky became dim, a light shone upon the group of buildings, illuminating them all at once. It was different from the glows that leaked one by one from the tiny windows. The buildings were floodlit by an intense light that seems to be advertising their existence. It’s probably some huge kind of spotlight.
A group of brightly lit buildings—I have no idea at all how she knew about this, and just when I thought how strange the country was,
“…”
Ti stood up and began walking towards the hotel. It’s about time for us to go home. I was finally relieved that our little walk culminated with no trouble. Ti, who was quite talkative today, mumbled once more.
“Different.”
Again, I don’t get it.


We got back into the hotel before it became dark.
“Here you go.”
We received our key back and returned to our room. On another note, there were no other customers besides us. Just when I was worrying how this hotel could keep up their business, I noticed the agricultural calendar on the wall and noted that people could be staying here during the busy farming season.
Dinner was croissant and marmalade again. Ti smeared plenty of marmalade on top of the halved croissant.
“…”
And silently handed it to me. While I was overcome with confusion, the marmalade began to drip.
“Oops!”
I caught it in the air, accepted the croissant and started to chew on it.
“Thank you.”
I thanked her, and Ti looked down at me, not showing a smile.
“Friend?”
“What? —Um, I guess so. Even if Master Shizu’s not here at the moment, we’re all traveling buddies.”
“Good.”
“Yes.”
“No problem.”
“Yes…?”
This day is filled with things I don’t understand.


Late that night, Master Shizu returned in the buggy. Just like that morning, Ti was already asleep, lying face down on her bed.
I welcomed the rather worn-out Master Shizu. He came into the room with both arms around a box about thirty centimeters wide and one meter long. Its lid was tied with a string.
Master Shizu quietly laid the box on the floor. When I asked him what’s in it, Master Shizu, now seated on a chair, answered somewhat awkwardly.
“That’s my reward for today’s work.”
Reward? Master Shizu confirmed that Ti was asleep, 
“I was asked by this country’s police to assist in obliterating a crime organization’s hideout. I was supposed to get money in return, but things suddenly changed when it’s over. I ended up being given some of the supplies that was confiscated from the hideout. Just as they say, problems exist in the police force of a country with problems.”
“I see. So what did they give you?”
“It’s…something that would probably be useful to us. There was nothing else but this.”
Master Shizu opened the lid of the box. Inside,
“What is this?”
It was more or less seventy centimeters in length. At a glance, one could tell that it was a persuader (Note: A gun). It has a stock that goes on top of the shoulders, a trigger, and an oddly thick barrel.
“It’s a ‘grenade launcher’.”
“A persuader?”
“Kind of. Because it has a thick barrel, it’s used exclusively for shooting out grenades.”
“… And will you be using that, Master Shizu?”
“No, I thought maybe I could give it to Ti. It seems she liked grenades a lot, but she’s not too good at throwing them.”
“…”
“Better than nothing, right?”


Master Shizu ate what was left of the croissant, and after taking a breather,
“How’s today?”
First I answered that we were safe, and that Ti talked more than usual, then I told him about the stuff that I did not understand.
“…Heh,” Master Shizu looked surprised. “That’s interesting. —It’s the first time for the two of you to be alone together for a whole day, wasn’t it?”
“Yes.”
“And so Ti probably thought she had to behave herself.”
“Really? —Well, indeed I may not have seemed too reliable because I am a dog…”
“I am very well aware of how dependable you are, Riku. But maybe Ti did not know that. —It just amuses me how she tried to demonstrate leadership between the two of you.”
“Well, it’s not like I wasn’t happy that she sees me as part of the team.”
“What do you mean?”
“I almost begged Kino to kill Ti in order to save you, Master Shizu.”
“Don’t dwell on it. We have avoided the worst.”
“I doubted that Ti considered someone like me a friend.”
“I think she does. I believe Ti thinks about a lot of things more than we think she does.”
“Really…? I’m afraid to say I don’t quite understand.”
“For instance, I think there might be some meaning behind her strange actions today.”
“Oh… How so?”
“First, as soon as I heard you say that she stomped on her shadow until it was gone, I thought Ti was trying to recognize anew the fact that those people in black that she lived with back in that country were gone. And that she stays strong in spite of it. That she’s ‘okay’.”
“Isn’t that a bit…far-fetched?”
“Maybe, but then there was that group of buildings at the country center. While observing them, Ti thought that those buildings at the center were like the Tower. But when they were lit up, she realized that they are ‘different’ from the Tower she knew, which always remained dark.”
“…”
“And during dinner… Wasn’t that Ti’s way of sharing her food with a friend? That makes me believe that you and Ti got along really well today.”
“…”
I didn’t say anything and kept silent, just like Ti. 
“But maybe I was just overthinking things.”
Master Shizu said with a shrug of his shoulders and laughed.


The next morning.
We were in the buggy outside the walls.
The weather was good. A green meadow spanned the entire surface ahead of the perfectly straight road.
“Shall we go then?” Master Shizu said in the driver’s seat while fixing his goggles.
“Yup,” Ti said on passenger seat as she stroked my head.
“Let’s go,” I said while settled between Ti’s legs and my head being stroked.
Then Ti embraced my head and spoke as she rubbed her cheeks on it.
“Yup. Let’s go together. Riku’s a friend.”


My name is Riku. I am a dog.
My face makes me look as if I’m always happy and smiling. But it doesn’t mean that I am. I was just born this way.
But right now, I am happy and smiling.
Shizu is my Master. He is a young man who always wears a green sweater, and had been traveling by buggy ever since he lost his homeland due to complex circumstances.
Another fellow traveler is Ti, a quiet girl with a fondness for grenades, and who has become part of the team ever since she lost her homeland due to complex circumstances.
The buggy took off.


"
40,v6c1,6,1,"It was a small room.
At its center was a single wooden bed. There was no way two such beds would fit in the room.
A painting was hanging from the low, light brown wall. It was bordered in such a way that made it look like a large window. It depicted an angel with fluttering white wings amidst a scenery of blue sky and animals feeding on the grass of a green prairie.
There was not a single real window in this room. It was being faintly illuminated by a dim light bulb suspended from the ceiling.
A human was lying on the bed.
It was a middle-aged woman. She was covered in a thick blanket of a light green color, and her head was sunk into a big pillow. Her eyes were open and looking straight ahead, but there was nothing she was gazing at in particular. Her slow, thin breaths escaped from her lifelessly opened mouth.
There were five people around the bed.
Four of them were two men and two women who were wearing the same clothes. They were clad in no other color but white from head to toe — white aprons, white caps, and white masks. They were standing on both sides of the bed.
The fifth was a young person wearing a black jacket. Perhaps around mid-teens, she had a fearless face framed with short black hair. She was standing at the foot of the bed with a big cloth bag hanging down from her left hand.
The four in white gazed towards the person in the bed and began to chat. There was no reply, but as if there was, they continued the dialogue meant for five people.
It was talk about the past. It was a recollection of the things the five of them shared and enjoyed together. Occasionally, the four would laugh merrily.
The person dressed in the black jacket looked on and stood quietly without saying anything. It’s as if she were looking at a distant and alien world.
The conversation continued at length. As the four broke into a fit of laughter, a faint smile slowly formed on the feeble mouth of the person on the bed who was only strong enough to breath.
One of the four noticed this, and quickly called the attention of the other three with a gesture. The four peered at the face of the bedridden woman.
The person in black inserted her right hand inside the cloth bag. With her left hand, she separated the cloth bag from a smaller bag, and let it fall to the floor without a sound. The form of the object she was grasping with her right hand was gradually revealed.
It was a long and narrow black mass of plastic and metal.
She lifted it up. It sent forth a thin red light which stopped precisely into a tiny dot on the bedridden woman’s breast.
The four in white did not pay heed.


A low explosive sound echoed in the tiny room. Three times in succession. Three dry, metallic sounds were heard right after.
The person the four were watching intently suddenly trembled as if hit by a small amount of electric shock. The person’s head rose a little from the pillow, and as if it lost strength, sank back into the pillow once more. Her eyes were still slightly open, but her thin respiration came to a stop. Slowly but steadily, a dark red stain appeared on the portion of the blanket where the chest was located. It didn’t spread out any further.
The person in black was gripping the hand persuader (Note: A gun. In this case a pistol) with both hands. It was a 9mm automatic with a built-in safety in the trigger. It was attached with a laser sight and a cylindrical suppressor (restrains the sound of the gunfire). Three empty cartridges rolled on the floor.
The four turned around.
One pair of eyes between the white mask and cap glared at the person holding the persuader.
“[Heretic, what a thing to do!]” The man said with a soft voice.
“[I killed because I wanted to kill.]” The person in black answered in a similarly soft voice.
“[Heretic, leave this place.]”
“[That I shall do.]”
After the short interchange, the person in black returned the persuader in the bag. She laid her hands on the door behind her and pushed it open.
One of the four gently closed the eyelids of the deceased, and then called out to the person in black who was about to go out.
“Thank you. …Thank you very much.”
Without answering the voice heavy with emotion, the person clad in black quietly disappeared from the room.


There was a gate.
The country was surrounded by high walls made out of gigantic rocks put together. There was only a single enormous door made of steel. It was tightly shut.
There was an expanse of forest just outside the country. It was a forest dense with tall and slender conifers.
It was covered with snow as deep as a child is tall. The ground was completely invisible. Amidst the damp atmosphere, the low clouds created a sky of a greyish shade.
A corridor began beside the closed gate. Its tall, gabled roof continued straight into the forest. It was laid out with stone paving, and on both sides were sturdy fences to keep out the snow. The weir-like corridor was sandwiched between the piles of snow fended off by the roof.
There was a small door for people to pass through beside the massive gate. Stones were affixed on the door, making it indistinguishable. Soon this door opened inwards with a gentle creaking sound.
The person in black came out from the door holding a bag. On her right thigh was a holster that was not there before. Inside it was a high caliber revolver.
Two guards followed her from behind. The guards were holding long spears in their hands, and they were wearing military uniforms adorned with ceremonial ornaments.
The guards stood on both sides of the door. The gazes underneath their decorated helmets were sharp. As the person in black looked back, the guards tapped the stone floor by their feet with their spears, creating a solid sound.
“[Heretic, murderer of our brethren, leave this country at once!]” One of the guards spoke in a stern and loud voice.
The person in black placed the bag containing the persuader by the guard’s feet. She spoke with no visible change in her expression.
“[I understand. I will leave this country right away.]”
Then she straightened up and turned away from the guards. She took a step towards the corridor inside the forest. The thin layer of snow crunched beneath her footsteps.
The guards remained standing on attention, but their stiff expressions crumbled down. One of them called out to the person in black with a tone of familiarity.
“We will send them later, as always.”
The person did not look back, and answered.
“I understand. Please leave it at the usual place.”
“Roger, Miss Kino. Thank you very much.”
The guard positioned his spear in front of his body.


The person in black called Kino slowly proceeded through the corridor. On both sides, there were pillars lined up in regular intervals, and the gentle snowdrifts beyond.
The sky became dimmer, and rain began to fall as if some unknown omen. The damp and heavy snow was strewn all at once. It fell endlessly without making the slightest sound.
Kino stopped in her tracks and looked left and right.
The snow falling in the space between the snowdrift and roof of the corridor gave off a sensation; one of being drowned in a continuously rising world.
“……”
After looking for a while, Kino eventually faced forward and continued her walk along the corridor.
Behind Kino, the angry peals of bells were heard from the country.


At the end of the corridor was a lone building.
It was a big building standing in isolation inside the forest. It was sturdily built out of stone and lumber. The corridor was connected to the entrance of the big, chimneyed, box-shaped building. Beyond, there was a long and narrow hallway lined up with rooms. Thick snow has accumulated on the roof, and a number of icicles were hanging down from it.
Kino brushed off the snow at her feet as she stepped up the high entrance. She opened the sliding door and entered the building.
There was a big living room immediately upon entry. The furniture was uniform and there were fireplaces and wood stoves on both ends of the room. The forest scenery could be seen beyond a large glass window. The snow continued to fall in the pale darkness.
Kino continued to the interior of the corridor and entered the first room. An electric light lit up as she pushed open a switch at the side.
Inside the room was a bed, a desk, a chair, and a small dresser, above which was a big traveling bag. Warm curtains were closed over a window. A motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) was parked in one corner of the room.
“Ah, good morning,” said the motorrad, though the sun was about to set.
“Good morning, Hermes.”
“Welcome home. How’s work?” the motorrad called Hermes asked Kino.
“There were three people,” answered Kino.
“That’s a lot. That’s why you were late.”
“Yeah——”


The next morning, Kino woke up at dawn.
Snow was still falling down vehemently. The sky was a dark gray. Other than the forest scenery, only the snow lashing in different directions could be viewed beyond the window.
She used the empty living room for her light exercises. Kino practiced her quick draw with ‘Canon’ and performed its maintenance afterwards.
Kino took a shower using the warm water drawn from inside the country and changed her clothes.
On one side of the building was a firewood shed. There was also a big stone box beside it. Kino opened it and took out some potatoes, onions, and sausages stored inside.
She hewed enough firewood to burn in the kitchen stove. Then she recklessly placed a frying pan above the flames, tossed the chopped ingredients inside it all at once and brought it to a boil. She ate half of it for breakfast.
She boiled water in a small cup, and drank her tea.
The sun has risen way above the clouds, and it has become a bit brighter outside. Snow was still falling.
Kino came back to the room and pushed Hermes into the living room. She set him up on his center stand beside the window.
“Ah, Kino. The bell?” Hermes asked.
“There’s none today,” Kino answered.


Firewood was burning in the fireplace, and it has become warmer indoors.
Kino took off her jacket and sat on a chair in the living room wearing her shirt. On the desk, various sizes of knives were lined up neatly along with a small bottle containing oil, and a sharpening stone.
“Done. I don’t have anything else to do for today,” Kino said.
“You have free time, eh. What about a round of shiritori[1]?” Hermes suggested. Snow was still falling beyond the slightly cloudy windows.
Kino made a bitter face. “I will lose because you use weird words…”
“Eh? But, there really is a dish called ‘Susannas’.”
“…… Maybe I should have my lunch…”
Kino arranged the knives and put them in the pouches and the bag.
Kino took the covered frying pan beside the window. She thrust it into the fireplace as it is.
She ate the warmed food, washed the frying pan with melted snow, and hung it back in its place.
While Kino was drinking her after meal tea, she heard footsteps by the entrance, and then there were several knocks on the door.
“Oh, how rare. We have guests,” Hermes said, and Kino stood up.
“Just like us.”


“This must be it, there’s no doubt. ——Well, there’s nothing else in this forest anyway.”
It was a man in his forties. His face and chin was covered with beard, and his hair down his back was tied together messily. He was wearing winter clothes and a wool hat. He was carrying a big luggage on his back, and was walking on top of the snow using handmade wooden snow shoes.
“I’m a traveler. My name is Dis[2]. I was told by the guards to come here. It’s nice to meet you.”
“I’m Kino. This here is my partner, Hermes.”
“Hello there.”
The man called Dis set down his luggage by the entrance, and remarked at the exquisiteness of the place. He removed the snow shoes outside, took off his winter clothing, and emerged in his sweater.
Kino offered him a seat. Dis thanked her, sat down, and gave a big sigh of relief. Then he told her that he was traveling with a horse when it collapsed in the snow, and he ended up getting caught in a terrible snowstorm. He managed to arrive in the country that morning.
And then he spoke to Kino. “I was quite surprised to see someone as young as you on a journey.”
“Someone like me?”
“Well, please don’t be offended. But for someone to go about exiling himself from his homeland and wander about on a journey — there must be ‘a certain reason’. To put it bluntly, most travelers are people who are no longer needed in their homelands, for one reason or another. I have nothing to hide, I am one such person. And there’s really no need to cross-examine each other. Let’s just get along,” Dis said cheerfully. Kino lightly nodded without changing her expression.
“You see, I came here without the least bit of an idea about this country. It’s fun that way though. After the entry procedures, I wasn’t surprised at all when they told me I had to earn my keep if I wanted to stay here until spring; in fact it’s quite the opposite. When they realized that I didn’t know a thing, they only told me to come here and ask you for the details. If I work, I would be able to stay here, right?”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“Not to boast, but I have a skill that is popular in any kind of country; something that would earn me money anywhere I go. I’ll probably get rich soon.”
“I see. But——” Kino continued, “In this country, what we will be doing will not need that much skill.”
Dis was slightly taken aback. “Is that so…? Well, what are we going to do then?” he asked Kino.
Kino remained expressionless as she answered the question.
“We will be killing people from this country.”


Kino explained everything to Dis, with Hermes butting in at times.
Because of a peculiar religion, ‘medical treatment’ was unknown in this country.
According to their doctrine, it was unforgivable for a person to perform some process on another person’s body. It was their God’s will. All humans have their place in nature; therefore, humans have to live in nature the same way as animals, and rely on their own bodies’ capacity to heal. Other than giving birth naturally, humans also have to die naturally. Any form of medical treatment or surgical operation done by other people are all artificial, and hence, evil. It’s the best-known way for the soul to be denied passage to heaven.
No person can intervene with an injury or illness. The body should heal on its own. The only thing the people around could do is to confine the patient and give him food and water when he asks for it.
Whether it’s a light injury or illness, or something serious, it is only natural to leave it as is and wait for the results. Because of this, almost all of the people in this country experience pain until they finally die ‘naturally’.
And in time, requests to put out of misery the people who were beyond hope appeared. However, their countrymen could not kill them. It’s considered murder — a one-way ticket to hell.
There was only one way to reach heaven without dying naturally. A doctrine in use during times of war states that a person killed by a heretic would go to heaven without question.
In short, it’s a ‘trip to Mars’. ‘Martyrdom?’ ——Yeah, that’s it.
A long, long time ago, they asked a traveler who was staying in the country to do this for them. The traveler accepted and killed the patient. As punishment, he was banished outside the country—— and received a reward from the family of the person he killed.
Eventually, the private requests were managed by the government. They built a place ‘outside the country’ for travelers to stay in, and upon accomplishing the requests, they will have to ‘leave the country’ as punishment. They will be promised a reward of food and other things, but they were especially prohibited to reenter the country after all is over.
To prevent them from residing permanently, the longest a heretic could stay was ninety days, or one season. There were people who stay for just one day and leave immediately, and there were also those who stay up until the last moment. During winters with particularly heavy snowfall, it’s either no one comes, or someone would stay until spring.
And then, Kino told him that she has already spent thirty days, and plans to stay until the snow was light enough to ride on.


Dis did not say a word. He listened to the explanation, all the while having a sullen expression on his face.
After narrating these circumstances, Kino then gave a simple explanation of the building they’re now in. It has many rooms in its interior, and it has electricity, water, and their daily supply of food and firewood. It will be the joint property of the people living in it. However, the euthanasia requests will have to be equally shared between them, and will be handled alternately. Those were the conditions.
“For the killing itself, they will be lending us a persuader and bullets at the gates. After the job is done, we will be treated like ‘heretics’, but there will be no problems as long as we answer properly.”
And then Hermes asked, “Okay, any questions?”
“I have.” At last, Dis opened his mouth to speak.
“So far, among the people you have ‘euthanized’, were there some… no, was there even one who could have been saved by the medical technology in the country you were born in?”
Kino pondered for a while and answered, “Probably.”
“If that’s the case…, then what you have been doing could be considered as ‘murder’, right?”
“I guess so.”
“Is murder… legal in your country?”
“Who knows? I don’t really understand perfectly how ‘the world of adults’ work.”
“……”
“Do you have any other questions? If none, then that’s it.”
“……. It’s murder. I can’t do something like that.”
“Is that so?”
“……”
Hermes questioned Dis, who was still glaring at Kino.
“Mister, you said it yourself, haven’t you? You went on a journey because you were driven out of your country for ‘a certain reason’. Until this day, have you no ‘experience’ in killing a person, not even once?”
Dis was surprised for a moment and his expression became dark. Then he shook his head.
“No…. I do have.”
“If that’s the case——” Kino spoke. “Then there’s no need for me to keep you here. There’s no reason for that.”


Evening.
Dis was sitting on the bed inside the room he had chosen. A small lamp was attached on the ceiling. A small leather briefcase was placed on top of the table. Beside it were the paper pack remains of his portable rations.
Outside the window, snow was falling soundlessly in the dark.
“What on earth… I shouldn’t have come to this kind of country…,” Dis muttered. He slowly shifted his gaze to the leather briefcase.
“What on earth… What in the world…”
He continued to mutter words nobody could hear.


Kino was in her own room, sitting on top of her bed. A small lamp was attached on the ceiling, its reflection distorted on Hermes’ tank. The curtains were closed.
“‘It’s not something I would like to do, and I think it’s wrong,’…eh?” Kino muttered.
“Kino is Kino. Instead of worrying about that, you should plan what you would do once spring comes,” Hermes answered.
“Spring—— it’s still far off.”


Morning.
Color has returned slightly to the snowy forest by the end of the night. The gray color has turned into a brighter shade of light blue. The white snow and the green leaves, as well as the row of brown tree trunks appeared once more.
Kino came out to the living room from the corridor, opened the window and looked outside.
It has stopped snowing but the sky remained cloudy. The snow accumulated in the forest has become even thicker. There were no sound of chirping birds; only the sound of snow falling from the trees could be heard from time to time.
In this cold weather, Kino began to move her body. After her warm-up exercise, she practiced her quick draw.
She took a shower and changed her clothes. She slung Canon on her waist belt, and wore her black jacket on top of her white shirt. She tapped Hermes awake and set him up beside a chair in the living room.
Like the previous day, she made the same amount of the same kind of food.
Dis came to the living room just when Kino was having her after meal tea.
Kino was slightly surprised, and Hermes spoke.
“Who are you?”
Dis shaved off all of his beard, and carefully cut his hair short. He looked rather young.
Dis still had his gloomy expression from the night before. He exchanged morning greetings with Kino and Hermes and sat in a chair.
“You did that by yourself?” Kino asked.
Dis said ‘yes’ and gave a small nod.
“You’re so good at it, I’m quite jealous.”
Dis did not answer. Kino pointed out to the frying pan in the kitchen. She told him that he could have the food she cooked for herself, and he doesn’t have to wash the frying pan afterwards.
Right then, they heard the bells tolling from the country. It resounded madly; the peals overlapped with one another.
“That bell is a signal to let the citizens know that ‘a heretic is going to attack’.”
Dis silently turned to the kitchen and reheated the contents of the frying pan, and then he returned to his seat.
“You’ll have to be warned before eating that.”
“……”
Dis looked at Kino once and then looked at the frying pan’s contents. Then he started to eat the food that Kino prepared.
“This is the daily menu. What will you have for today?”
“How was it?”
Kino and Hermes asked almost at the exact same time. Dis did not answer and continued to eat in silence.
He ate all of it and put the frying pan and fork aside. Dis looked at Kino. He was staring at her with the same sullen look he had the previous night. At last he spoke,
“I’ll go today.”
“I’ll go today, without complains,” he repeated as he stood up and disappeared into his room. Soon after, he came out wearing his hat and winter clothing. He was carrying a small leather briefcase.
“And I’ll make sure you won’t have to go starting tomorrow,” Dis said.
Kino slowly stood up from her chair. “What do you mean?”
“If there’s a way to save a person, I will save him.”
“How in the world?” Hermes asked from behind.
“Of course, by medical treatment.”
“Even if by some miracle you do happen to ‘persuade’ them, there are no doctors in this country. They might have never heard of ‘medical treatment’ either,” Kino said.
Dis nodded. “That may be true.”
“What are you going to do? Phone a doctor from some far-away place?” Hermes said, and this time, Dis slowly shook his head.
“There’s no need for that. ——There’s a doctor right here.”
Dis opened wide the bag for Kino and Hermes to see. First there were scalpels and files neatly lined up, along with a stethoscope and syringes. In the interior of the bag, there was a case containing various medical tools.
“……. I thought you were a barber.”
“That was a surprise.”
Kino and Hermes said. Dis nodded several times and closed the bag.
“I was a doctor. Haven’t I told you? ‘I have a skill that is popular in any kind of country.’”
“I see.”
“I get it.”
“I worked in the hospitals in the countries where I have dropped by. I learned things, and sometimes, taught them.”
“Okay, but why?” Hermes asked. 
Dis smiled bitterly, “‘No reason’, I guess.”
“A ‘deal’ between Kino and you?”
“Hahaha,” Dis continued to laugh bitterly. And then,
“Then let me tell you — why I was deemed useless in my home country. It’s a pretty ridiculous story considering our situation here. To put it simply, ‘I was a doctor. I killed my patients on purpose because there was nothing that could have saved them.’”
“That means, you…,” Kino hesitated.
“That means you performed euthanasia,” Hermes blurted out.
“I told you that I have ‘experience’, haven’t I?”
“I see.”
Kino remained silent, waiting for Hermes’ words.
“In short that was the ‘certain reason’ you were talking of. Am I wrong?”
“Yes, exactly. I don’t mean to brag, but the medical field is rather advanced in my home country. I didn’t know it back when I was still there, but now that I think about it, ours was really much more advanced. I learned a lot of things there. But, even so, there are always patients who are ‘beyond hope’. No treatment or medicine could heal them, and all we can do is to ease their agony. But there was a limit to that too. I never thought that we doctors were lacking in terms of competency. But at those times, we were completely powerless.”
“And so, there were people who wanted to be put out of misery,” Hermes said.
“Yes. Those who can’t be healed with our current medical technology. Those whose pain can no longer be relieved. Such patients willfully desire a peaceful death… to end their suffering, to remain recognizable even with their broken bodies and mind, to be surrounded by the things and the people that they love, to ‘embark on their journey’ with a smile and an elegant farewell speech.”
“Like the people of the country closest to us?” Kino asked.
“Like the people of the country closest to us,” Dis answered, and continued, “But that is illegal in our country. There are various reasons, but at the end of the day, it all comes home to one conclusion: ‘No matter what the state of the patient is, no matter how many people wish for it, a doctor who performs euthanasia is a murderer.’”
“And you did it.”
“Yeah. But until I have decided, it wasn’t as easy as worrying ‘how much salt and pepper were sprinkled in my food’. I worried for several years.”
“Then, what happened?”
“I continued to live this double life for so many years. One side gives life, the other takes it. It’s ironic how I received gratitude for both. Then one day, I was suddenly arrested by the police.”
“Then, then?”
“The whole country was shocked with the number of people I have killed. Euthanasia became the talk of the town, but nothing has changed for me. I thought I would be given a life sentence at best, and death penalty otherwise. I have no idea what would happen to me, but I prepared myself for the worst. ——When I heard that I would be banished, I was oblivious of what was happening for a moment. It was like that.”
“I see. Now I get it. Thanks.”
“You’re welcome,” Dis moved his gaze from Hermes to Kino.
“I’m sorry for bothering you with such a long story. I should be going now. I plan to do as much as I could. If it’s acceptable for them to have their countrymen killed by a heretic, then I will do it. But, I will do it using my own methods. My hands might slip, and treat a wound accidentally. Also I might mix a lethal medicine with one that is effective for a person’s illness. If as a result, the person recovers from it, then it is by his own body’s capacity, and I am not to blame.”
Kino asked, “I don’t know whether these people would buy that excuse without any objections. Even so, are you still going to do it?”
“Yes.”
“‘Do or die’, right?”
“Life is like that. The decisions made by the living become a choice between ‘life and death’. They’re related. Until now, I have let other people decide for me. From now on, I’ll decide for myself. Last night, I was thinking of what I should do. In the end, it’s not a question of ‘what I should do’ but of ‘what I want to do’.”
“I see…. What if I ‘persuade’ you to stop?”
Dis understood in an instant. “Ah, I see, so it’s like that——. If I succeed, then you won’t be able to stay here. In other words, you will lose your ‘job’ and ‘a place to stay’.”
“That’s right. Maybe I’d stop you even if I had to kill you. If it’s in order to live, maybe I wouldn’t hesitate.”
Kino glanced at Canon on her right thigh and placed her hand on her right waist.
“Is that a .44 caliber revolver? That’s a scary thing you have there. If you shoot me, I might die.”
“Yeah.”
“Even so I will still go,” Dis answered. He held his bag with his right hand, and tapped his chest with his left fist.
“When you shoot, please fire three at once to my heart. ——Don’t make me suffer,” were the words he left with a smile as he headed towards the entrance. He opened the door. The moment he went out of the building,
“I am wishing that the bells will not have to toll,” Kino said. Dis didn’t turn around, and only his voice returned.
“People can’t be saved with that ‘wish’.”
“I know.”
“Too bad.”
“Yeah, too bad.”
Dis began to walk, and his back became smaller as he advanced. The hand on Kino’s waist dropped until the holster.
Dis suddenly turned around. He faced Kino with a smile, and spoke with a loud voice. “Oh yeah, I forgot to say one thing!”
“What is it?”
“The food you cooked earlier. It was so delicious! Thank you. —— 	Bye.”
“……”
Shock was painted on Kino’s face. Without saying anything, she waited until his figure vanished from sight, and closed the door.


Noon passed by.
The snow has stopped falling.
The wind blew away the clouds and slowly, the blue sky became visible.


Evening came.
Red rays of light escaped from the gaps between the remaining clouds.
On the desk inside the living room, Kino disassembled, cleaned, and reassembled the automatic type she called ‘Woodsman’.
When she was finished, Kino lifted her face. Beyond the windows, water was continually dripping from the icicles.
The sound of footsteps was heard, and someone knocked at the door. The sound awoke the sleeping Hermes.
“We have guests.”
Kino holstered Woodsman and stood up.
“Miss Kino. Are you there?” came a voice. It was familiar.
“Oh, it’s just the guards,” Hermes said. Kino opened the entrance and invited the guards inside. One of the guards was carrying a wooden box. The other one was not carrying anything.
“Miss Kino, we have sad news for you,” the guard who always saw Kino off began.
“What would that be?”
The guard remained standing at attention, and proceeded with the news.
“[The heretic who entered our country today was in firm isolation after causing harm to our brethren who were fighting against their illnesses. It was the man who came here yesterday.]”
“……”
“Uh-huh, and then?”
“[The harm he inflicted upon our brethren was not serious, and our brethren soon recovered after demonstrating the strong natural healing powers of our kind. But we cannot possibly pardon this man’s actions, and so we restrained him. To never let such a thing happen again, he is to be punished, and we demand him to apologize to our brethren who are currently battling their afflictions. He was grateful for our lenient treatment, and accepted his punishment wholeheartedly. He wouldn’t come back to this place for a while. It is so that he wouldn’t exact the same harm again. If he were to do the same foolish thing once more, he will have to undergo this divine retribution for eternity.]”
“I see. What a troublesome guy.”
“True, true.”
“[Indeed. We have no inkling as to what goes on in his mind. As for you Miss Kino, we will have to restrict your entry and actions in the country until that man is reformed. From now on, we will not hand you a persuader when you come into the country.]”
“I understand.”
“[And lastly, though that man was a foolish criminal, we guaranteed him his living necessities, and will give him what we have in stock out of kindness. When we told him that, he brazenly declared: ‘I don’t eat much, so please give half to any other heretic under your care.]’”
“……”
“[We cannot consume what this criminal heretic has touched. But, the precious food given to us by God and nature cannot be thrown away as declared in our doctrine, and so we decided to dispose of them here. We will bring them every day, to you, and to all other people who would ask leave to reside in this place.]”
Then the other guard presented the wooden box he was holding. He opened the lid. Inside were the usual ingredients.
“[This is all we have to say! We are here to collect the criminal heretic’s belongings. Do you have a message you would like to convey to him?]”
“Yes. There’s just one thing,” Kino said with a smile.
“Go ahead.”
“I am sorry for making you eat that stuff. For some reason, you are the first one to say that it was delicious with a smile on your face.”
“What?” the guard’s stiff expression crumbled down.
From behind Kino, Hermes spoke with an amused tone,
“Master almost died from it, though.”
“That time I thought she was shot or something.”
The two guards looked at each other.
“[We’ll tell him exactly as you said it.]”
“Please do.”
And then the two guards carefully carried off all of Dis’ luggage and left the building.


The evening sun stained the world a bright red, and soon descended. The snow from the roof fell all at once with a loud sound.
Though it has become dark, the bell tolled once more in the country.


Evening.
Kino was in her own room, sitting on top of her bed. A small lamp was attached on the ceiling, its reflection distorted on Hermes’ tank.
Kino’s luggage was laid out on top of the bed.
Kino carefully put in order her folded shirts, hats, gloves, and other small accessories, and put them inside the bag.
After this, she closed the bag. She took the cup on top of the desk and slowly drank her tea, which has become a little cold.
“Say Kino, what will you do once spring comes?” Hermes asked, and Kino answered,
“Spring eh. Let’s see… Again——”















"
41,v6c2,6,2,"My name is Riku. I’m a dog.
I have long, white, bushy fur. I always look happy and smiling, but it doesn’t mean that I am. I’m just born this way.
Shizu is my master. He is a young man always wearing a green sweater who lost his homeland due to some complex circumstances and is now traveling in a buggy.	


We were in a spring forest surrounded by brilliant greenery. The morning sun was warm.
We could hear the sound of water. Right before us was a wide multi-stage waterfall. Its water formed a river that flowed through the ground covered with short grass and scattered thick trees.
In the middle of the river, a buggy was standing. More than half of its tires were submerged in the water, so it looked as if the car was floating in the river.
Master Shizu, wearing a sweater with rolled-up sleeves, was cleaning up the buggy; his jeans below the knees were soaking wet. His boots, as well as a black bag and his beloved katana were placed side by side on the riverbank. I was watching over it while keeping an eye out for unwelcome guests. There were no particularly urgent matters so I just listened to the twittering of the birds.


We arrived here yesterday evening and set up a camp. In the morning, Master Shizu washed himself and his clothes in the river. When it was my turn, I humbly declined, so he pushed me into the water and washed me too. My fur is almost dry now.
After that, he did something really unexpected.
“Buggy also needs to be cleaned up from time to time,” he said, and drove the car into the river to a reasonable depth. He began washing the buggy covered with dust, oil and mud. He worked as joyfully as he did a while ago while washing me. The water under the car instantly became dirty, but soon it was driven away by the clean water from the stream.


In the last country.
The residents didn’t actually put it into words, but judging by their faces and the atmosphere, they wanted an outsider to leave their country as soon as possible.
Master Shizu also kept it to himself, but he realized what was going on. That’s why he didn’t look for any work; he just sold all he could, bought what he needed, and in the evening we left this country.


The birds were twittering.
Master Shizu rinsed the cloth with the water under his feet and wrung it out, then he wiped the car body and the seats. He pondered over something for a moment, and then he climbed up the riverbank. While I looked at him, trying to figure out what he’s doing, he picked up a fallen tree branch and returned to the buggy.
Using this branch he carefully rubbed off the mud from the pipe frame.
Suddenly I decided to ask a question I never asked before. I wondered where he got this buggy.
“Didn’t I tell you?” he said, a little surprised. Then he explained to me how it happened, while continuing to clean up the buggy.


Once, before we met, Master Shizu was forced to travel on foot as there were no traveling merchants who needed bodyguards, and the next country wasn’t so far away. On his way there, he stumbled upon a battlefield site. Not long ago a place of fierce combat, now it was a heap of broken vehicles and frozen corpses covered with a thin layer of snow.
Master Shizu searched for something of value. He examined the arms and fingers of each and every body, but found nothing. And then he discovered this buggy. Miraculously, it was almost undamaged and the engine was in good condition. He removed the bodies from the top of the car and gathered up fuel and fuel cans—— And from that time onwards he has been using this buggy to travel.


“So that’s how it was,” I said.
He laughed and added: “After driving for a while I smelled a terrible stink. When I examined the buggy, I found out that the source of smell was a rotting hand stuck to the bottom of the car.”
“Well, the buggy has never been serviced properly, and it even might be the first time it has been cleaned so thoroughly,” he said.
Master Shizu bent over the far side of the car. After a while he gave a small shout of surprise. When he got up, he held something in his hands.
It appeared to be a thin steel plate — about the size of a notebook. It had the same color as the buggy and folded in two with a hinge. Master Shizu said that it was inserted in a crack in the car’s body. He threw away the branch, opened the plate, and examined it.
When the branch slowly floating downstream completely disappeared from view, a light smile appeared on his face. He was holding this plate with both hands, smiling quietly.
‘What is it?’ I asked. Master Shizu approached me, pushing his way through the water, and laid the plate in front of me.
I read the letters carved in the plate.


Our dear horses…
We will fight. To defend our beloved motherland. To defend our beloved families.
We are soldiers, thus we are prepared to die on the battlefield.
We will fight till death, therefore our motherland will come out victorious and the peace in our families will be preserved.
Our dear horses—— Together we will fight and together we will die.
You were born to fight. You were born to plunge deep into the enemy lines and rush through the gunfire.
It is you whom we’ll ride and fight on, and you’ll be the place of our death.
And then you shall die in obscurity, embracing our corpses.


In other words it was a letter from the soldiers to this buggy.
After Master Shizu finished reading, he lifted his head and looked at the buggy completely cleared of mud.
“Huh, it’s no different from me,” he said.
I didn’t grasp the meaning of it, so he looked at me and laughed slightly.
“We both didn’t die where we were supposed to.”


Master Shizu picked up the steel plate, folded it up and threw it away.
It flew for a while spinning around, then fell in the river and sank.


He sat in the driver’s seat and turned on the engine.
The engine was humming. He ran the buggy onto the riverbank, and the water flowed down on the grass.
He wiped his legs, put on his boots and loaded the luggage. I jumped onto the passenger seat. My fur and my seat were still wet, but I think it’ll dry up pretty soon.
Master Shizu raced the engine and it hummed smoothly.
“That mechanic did a great job,” he said suddenly.
I remembered dull snowy plain and completely white dreary scenery[1].
“Right,” I agreed.
“Well, shall we go?” he asked and looked at me.
“Where are we going?” I inquired.
“I don’t know. Some unknown place,” he answered, and the buggy started running.



"
42,v6c3,6,3,"It was a large country.
Let alone the opposite sides, even from the royal castle built at its center, the walls surrounding the country could not be seen.
Except for the castle town and the nearby villages east and west of the castle gates, the whole country was an expanse of farmlands and grasslands. Numerous rivers flowed within the country, and there was a large lake located at its southeastern end.  Luminous clumps of white clouds lazily drifted in the sky.
“There’s no one in this direction either.”
“Damn . Where could he be?”
A number of the king’s aides were running around the castle corridors, faces blue from distress. They opened doors at random and searched inside.
One person seized a maid and asked her where the king was. The maid, overcome with the person’s rough behavior,
“His highness was supposed to meet with some travelers…”
“I already know that! I’m asking where they are right now! He couldn’t possibly be abducted by those travelers, could he?”
“No way,” said the maid. The aide ignoring her,
“No, it’s possible. Those two are suspicious no matter how you looked at them. It must be a piece of cake for them to abduct his highness in exchange for bribes. I can see it in their faces. That’s why I was against the idea of letting them enter the castle. Damn! You go look for them too!” the aide said, pointing his finger at the maid. At that moment, she saw three people coming from the other side of the corridor.
One of them is a young man — this country’s king. One is a rather short, handsome man with blonde hair and blue-eyes, a traveler. And the last one is a youthful woman with long black hair and wearing a stylish jacket, a traveler.
“What’s with the ruckus? It’s so noisy,” said the king. The maid bowed reverently, and the aide hastily turned around and followed suit.
The king explained that he was drinking tea with the travelers in the courtyard, and added, “I became engrossed with stories from foreign lands. But I was bothered with the all the riot you created just because I was not in my usual room.”
“Yes sir. Our sincerest apologies.”
“The guests will be leaving after a while. I’ll go take a walk around the castle after that, so don’t go about looking for me, yelling all over the place.”
“Yes sir.”
The three walked away, leaving the aide bowing with a loathsome look on his face.


A car passed through the gates of the castle.
It was small, yellow, and quite battered. The car looked as if it’s going to break at any moment.
The female traveler was in the driver’s seat, while the male traveler was sitting in the passenger seat.
The car was making sputtering and other unpleasant noises as it ran on the stone-paved streets of the town. It continued on with occasional repetitive thumps and thwacks coming from the engine’s defective spark plug accompanied with white or black smoke belches.
The man spoke. “Master. Let’s have that broken window fixed. If we go buy glass, it won’t take long.”
The window by the driver’s seat was cracked and badly fixed with tape. Its vibration was making an annoying rattling sound.
“One of these days then,” the woman said.
The car exited the town and went through a narrow road between the fields. Nobody noticed them except for people doing farm work from afar.
“Your highness, is this really okay with you?” the man asked all of a sudden.
The king was tucked in at the bottom of the luggage in the narrow back seat. Still in his very unique position, the king answered with a smile, 
“It’s fine. This country’s lord is nothing but decoration. We were deprived of all power during my great-grandfather’s time. Most of the citizens don’t even know my face. That’s why none of the citizens would worry even if I disappear. The ones who will be troubled most are the handful of people whose job is to deck out the king, enriching themselves with the budget meant for that.”
“I see…,” said the man. The woman did not change her expression and continued driving.
“That’s why I have decided to live with the one I love. I’ve had enough living like a bird in a cage,” the king said decidedly.
“This love of yours must be quite a beauty, huh?” the man asked cheerfully.
“Why, of course,” the king answered. “I shudder whenever I recall that beauty. That we can live together always from now on… makes me feel tremendous happiness deep inside my soul.”
“How did you first meet?”
“One day, a festival was held in the castle town. Only on such occasions can I participate, hiding my real identity. I’m surrounded with an annoying entourage, though. Then, I met her, who came from the outskirts of the country. One glance and it was as if I heard the sound of the world being redrawn in an instant by an angel of love. It was a divine moment.”
The man whistled. “But your highness, couldn’t you just have called her to the castle?”
“When I told this to my heartless and ignorant henchmen, they treated me as if I was sick. They called a doctor and tried to give me some terrible medicine. It seems they think that there are more appropriate women for me. ——Ugh! Rubbish. Anyway, they will probably arrange it to be someone’s haughty daughter.”
“I see…. But isn’t that great? You threw away everything for the sake of your romance,” the man said, and the king replied with a slightly dejected tone,
“I’m truly sorry that I got you involved like this. I’m truly grateful. You were able to get me out with little trouble. And without asking for a reward…”
Then, the woman behind the wheel who was silent until now slowly spoke. “Your highness, we were touched by your sincere feelings. For that, pretending to be kidnappers is not a big deal.”
The man also smiled. “Anyway, our notoriety is well-known everywhere. Your highness made the right choice.”
“… I will never forget you both. Someday if a child is born between us, the beautiful fruit of our love will be named after you.”
“That’s an honor, your highness. Please make a lot of cute babies. Soon, you can reveal yourself. Until then, I apologize for keeping you in such a strange position,” said the man.


The car reached the outskirts of the country, as the walls came into view. Pastures spread out all over the whole vicinity.
The king gave the woman directions.
Eventually,
“Oh, over there. That lone house in the meadows. There’s no doubt about it.”
“Ah, this place is nice,” the man said.
The car stopped in front of a cozy little house. It seemed like it belonged to a farming family, as a silo can be seen behind it.
The king borrowed the man’s hand to crawl out from the back seat, and immediately shouted,
“Marie!”
And then he rushed to the house.
“So it’s ‘Miss Marie’, huh?” the man said happily, and from the back of the house,
“Who is it?” the clear voice of a woman was heard.
The king hastily turned to the back of the house. The two followed after him.
At the back, there was a small barn and a well where water could be drawn. Beside a big bucket where the water was collected, there was a girl.
“Marie!” the king said happily, arms wide open and face beaming with delight.
The girl saw the king. Her long chestnut hair was braided on both sides, and her neat facial features were left with a few freckles. The sleeves of her checked shirt were rolled up, letting a sheep drink water from her hands.
“Oh…” The girl stood up as she spoke. She wiped her hands lightly on her apron.
“You’re the mister from the festival, right?”
The king gave a small nod.
“Yeah. I’m so glad you remembered me…. I came to see you. Since that day, that time…,  I wanted to see you again ―― ”
The king cut short his words, and slowly proceeded with his confession.
“I couldn’t forget about you. That’s why I discarded my previous life, and I’m here now…. That is… From here on, I want to always be with you. I want us to live together. There’s nothing else in this world more important to me than you. …. So, I want to stay here. I want to live here with you…. Is that not possible…?”
The girl’s face showed a bit of surprise, “I know how you feel.”
Then she smiled and asked the king, “If you live here, will you help with the work?”
“Of course! I’ll do anything!” the king answered right away.
The girl coyly lowered her gaze, and asked in a gentle, but clear tone. “Will you… be kind?”
The king looked straight at the girl’s eyes. “Yes. I swear to God. … Is that good enough?”
“Yes…”
The girl nodded a little shyly, but firmly. The king slowly stepped forward and approached. Before the two travelers who looked on, the king kneeled by the girl’s side,
“Marie!” he exclaimed, and embraced the sheep that was drinking water.[1]
“Marie! Marie! Marie!”
“Meeeeeee-eee,” the sheep cried out as if it was in pain. The girl squatted beside them, and spoke,
“Look, mister. Don’t squish her too much. Marie hates that.”
“Ah, sorry. I’m just so happy right now…. I love Marie so much.”
“I know how you feel,” the girl said. The king once again threw his arms around the white and fluffy hair of the sheep.
“Oh, Marie. From now on we will be together. Until you die, I will devote my life to you. Our love will be for eternity.”
“Isn’t that great, Marie?”
“Meeeeeeee-ee!”
Behind the two humans and one sheep,
“……”
The male traveler made a face that was very hard to describe.
The female traveler simply stood without changing her expression. And then she spoke.
“Well then, it’s about time for us to go.”


The small, yellow, battered car that looked as if it’s going to break at any moment ran through the meadows while the sound of its rickety engine reverberated. The walls reflected in the side mirror steadily became lower and soon disappeared.
The man in the passenger seat looked bored, tinkering with his favorite hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol). It was a slender, automatic-type, with a weighted square barrel.
When he got tired of this, he put away the persuader in the holster on his left hip, and opened his mouth to speak.
“Master…”
“What is it?”
“Umm, about the king and Marie… is that okay?”
The woman answered, “Who knows? If they themselves say it’s fine, maybe everything will be all right.”
“… Well, I suppose that’s true, but…,” the man took one deep breath, and changed the topic. “Besides that, I have better opinion of you, Master.”
“About what?”
“You accepted this job even if there’s not much money involved. Though it turned out like this… Despite your outward appearance, are you actually a romantic?”
The woman looked at the man for a moment. “That may be true. Take the bag under my seat.”
“?”
The man stretched his hand to the back seat and took the bag under the driver’s seat. He wondered why it was awfully heavy and took a look inside. A fairly large number of glittering bracelets, rings, jewels, and gold coins were inside.
“……”
The man became speechless for a while.
“… Uh, Master…  what is this?” the man asked.
“Those were things from the king’s room and the hallways. I packed them up since we’re at it,” the woman answered frankly.
“Master…”
“Hmm?”
“Have you heard of the term ‘fire looters’[2]?”
“Yeah,” the woman said shortly, and then, “He wouldn’t have any need for those anyway. Besides,”
“Besides?”
“‘Our notoriety is well-known everywhere’, right?”
The car spouted white smoke intermittently as it ran.
“Master…”
“Hmm?”
“If this leaks out, our physical descriptions will be distributed to other travelers for sure.”
“I don’t really mind. ―― Do you want to go home now?” the woman said, stopping the car which was now spitting black smoke.
The man in the passenger seat was silent for a while, and then spoke.
“…Hey Master, let’s have that broken window fixed.”
“One of these days then,” was the woman’s short answer as she started the car.



"
43,v6c4,6,4,"This is a story that happened in a certain forest.
Inside a dark forest dense with all kinds of trees, there was a road. It was a perfectly straight, level dirt path that was easy to ride through. The gentle undulations on the earth repeatedly overlap with the terrain, consequently creating repeated undulations on the road itself.
No nearby country’s walls could be seen; it was truly right in the middle of nature.
A river’s gently flowing stream ran inside this forest. Perhaps it was a little small to swim in, but it might be big enough to play in. Its water was so clear that the mud at the bottom of the calm river could be seen very clearly.
The road becomes a bridge where it meets with the river. It was a rather ancient bridge built from stones put together.
Seated on this bridge was an old man who was letting a fishing line dangle down the stream.
It was a thin and tall, and considerably aged old man. Half of his head had graying hair, and half was already bald. He was dressed much like a farmer, wearing a worker’s overalls. Placed beside him was a bucket filled with water, but not a single fish was inside.
The sun was at its highest, leisurely warming the world. Clouds were unlikely to make shadows as they floated about in strips. A person who pays attention to the seasons would say that it’s almost summertime.
The old man who was gripping the short rod suddenly lifted his face. He looked up, trying to peek at the other side of the road. The old man’s ears were not mistaken, and just as he expected, he saw a car leisurely riding towards his direction, raising a thin layer of dust.
It was a small, yellow, and not so clean car. Its body was rusty here and there and it was chipped in places. The old man set aside his rod and waved to the car while being careful not to fall.
The car stopped on top of the bridge with a strange sound.
There were two people aboard. On the right side was the driver’s seat, where a rather short but handsome young man wearing a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) on his left hip, was seated. On the left side was a youthful woman with lustrous, long black hair, wearing elegant-looking clothes and a high caliber revolver on her right hip. Both of them exchanged glances, as if surprised to find a person in such a place.
“Yo! You’re travelers, aren’t you?” the old man said in delight. The woman bowed in greeting.
“Hello. We were not expecting to meet anyone in a place like this.”
“I am a person who abandoned his country. I live here with my wife, just the two of us,” the old man said. Then he invited the surprised pair to come to his house. With a gentle smile, he told them that he would like to listen to stories of their travels while drinking some tea. And if they so choose, they could stay there for a while to rest their tired bodies.
“Since we’re not in any hurry, we’ll take up your kind offer,” the woman said, and the old man’s eyes narrowed.
“That’s great. It seems that this day will be very enjoyable. My house is there, at the top of the stream. I will walk along the river up to my house. You have to make a little detour though. A little bit ahead of the road, there’s a narrow descending path to the left side. You can pass through that path with your car.”
“Understood,” the woman said. The man asked the old man a question as he returned to the car,
“Did you catch anything?”
“Yeah,” the old man answered with a smile, lifting his rod and the bucket containing nothing but water. Then he skillfully coiled the line around the fishing rod with one hand.
“Then, we’ll be waiting for you.”
Leaving these words, he began to walk along the river.


“Master… are we really going?” the man asked the woman.
“Let’s go. Tea from the forest is good stuff, you know,” the woman answered immediately.
“Okay…,” the man only muttered.


There was a house.
In one part of the house, there was a big square iron box that might have been originally a car. Its window frames were sealed with planks. Built attached on its side was a log cabin.
The house was built beside a river. The surrounding land was neatly cultivated and lined up with fields. Beside the house was a livestock pen where a few animals were kept.
The shabby yellow car came slowly down from the narrow forest road. It stopped in front of the house where the old man and an old woman were waiting.
The four exchanged greetings and the tiny-figured old woman with an ever-present smile on her face guided them to the log cabin. On the high entrance made of planks put together, lots of pretty flowers were blooming in several plant pots.
They entered the house. There was a huge living room immediately upon entry. It was a spacious house, and there seemed to be several rooms in its interior.
Indoors, the logs were quite skillfully put together, creating a space that was simple but beautiful. The furniture and tools were all hand-crafted from wood. The walls made of stacked logs were decorated with carved trays and several elegantly framed paintings of flowers. Similar pictures were painted on the dishes neatly lined up on the shelves. Hanging from the thick log pillar were two brooms made from neatly whittled branches.
On two wall surfaces were large windows made from modified glass panes of a car. Presently it was open, letting in the cool wind into the room. Beyond it, the fields, the beautiful forest, and the silently flowing river could be seen.
There was a table rounded from a big log, as well as chairs made from wood carefully put together. The woman and the man expressed their gratitude and sat on the chairs offered to them. The old man sat opposite them and the old woman went towards the cooking stove at one end of the room to prepare tea.
“What a nice house. I was surprised,” the man said.
“I’m really glad to hear that,” the old man said happily.
The old man talked about their circumstances. They were a married couple and had no children. In their youth, they felt bitterness towards their country and left on a journey by trailer. They had nowhere to immigrate in as there were no countries nearby, but the gentle climate of this forest suited them well so they started to live a self-sufficient. They used materials from nature, built a house, raised animals, grew vegetables, and produced various things with their own hands. For several decades, the two lived each day in peace. Their skills were very useful in making a living in such a place. They would invite the occasional traveler out to tea and hold a fun tea party.
“That’s wonderful. I too, would love to settle down in a place like this when I grow old,” the woman said gently. The man beside him became rather surprised.
“I didn’t know you were having such thoughts, Master…”
“It’s not like I wanted to do nothing but to travel my whole life, after all.”
“Well, I see your point, but…”
After this exchange from the pair, the old man asked.
“Until when are you two planning to travel?”
“I guess until I finish my business,” answered the man. He said things like not having any particular place to go to, not having anyone waiting for him in his homeland, and not having plans of setting up some business.
“Well, I’m someone you’d call a wanderer,” the man said as if mocking himself. The woman had nothing to say in particular, and remained seated.
“Is that so…. Finding traveling painful or fun; there are various sides to it too, eh?” the old man said, seemingly moved.
“But, methinks staying in the same place the whole time is a little boring,” the man said.
“There are fun things too. It’s enjoyable to make various things with our hands, using materials from nature. This is our purpose in life.”
“Everyone, tea’s ready.”
The old woman was holding a tray. Placed on it were four empty cups and a big teapot.
The woman expressed her interest in the cups, asked permission and took one in her hands. The cup had an almost perfect shape and was lacquered in a pretty color. It was a lovely cup.
“Did you also make this? It’s very well done.”
The old woman nodded happily. The old man told them that looking for earth suited for pottery was very hard, and after several years of searching inside the forest without any luck, they found it by accident along the nearby riverbank.
“Now, now, the tea will get cold,”
The old woman poured tea in the four cups. She placed them in front of the guests and her husband, and sat down in her own chair.
“Thanks for the tea,” said the woman. She carried the cup to her lips and tasted it after testing the temperature a little. ‘It’s delicious,’ she said after taking a few sips. The old couple also savored their tea.
“……”
After some time, the man finally tasted his tea.
“I would have brought some sweets, but we finished them just yesterday, it’s quite embarrassing…,” the old woman said, and the woman immediately shook her head lightly.
“Please don’t trouble yourself over us.”
“Travelers, if you are not in any hurry, why don’t you stay the night? It’s been quite a while since we have had a meal with other people, and we would like to hear stories from the outside,” the old man said. And then, after one mouthful of tea, the woman shook her head.
“We can’t do that.”
The old couple was slightly taken aback. The woman set her cup on the table and suddenly stood up. Then she lifted her own chair and threw it towards the glass window.
There was a violent sound as the glass shattered. The chair broke as well.
“!”
“Aaaah!”
The old couple was surprised, and at the same time, the man beside them hurled his chair in the same manner. It broke as it hit the log walls.
The woman quickly walked to the dresser at the edge of the wall and kicked it. The thin plank was easily broken, and the small pot ornaments placed on it were shattered irreparably. The man reached for the dishes above the shelves and shoved them to the edge. They fell on the wooden floor with a crash.
“W-what’s this about?”
The old man was only able to say this much. Mixed shock and fear registered on his face, and the hands placed in front of his chest trembled.
“T-travelers! P-please stop! Please stop…”
Whether they heard it or not, the two visitors continued to diligently wreck the house. The man kicked and shattered the other glass window to smithereens. The woman dropped the paintings and stamped on the frames.
The old woman cried out.
“I beg you! Travelers! Don’t break them! These are full of our memories! We apologize if we did something that did not please you! Please! Please…”
The pair was not yet finished. They continued to wreck the place.
“Ah! We are just feeble old folks. You can take anything you want; it doesn’t matter. But please, our house… the only place that shields us from rain and wind… I’m begging you, please stop!”
The two still did not stop. There was no particular indication of hatred on their faces. They had normal expressions and a look of indifference, as if to say that they were only ‘doing today’s exercises’. They destroyed everything that caught their eyes. Almost everything hanging from the wall was broken.
“So cruel… Have we done anything that rubbed you the wrong way…? The house the two of us protected up to now… the memorable things…”
The old woman broke down crying on the floor while the old man’s face became red with anger. He grabbed the broom hanging by the pillar, and holding the grip with both hands, brandished it towards the man trampling on the dishes near the wall. The old man couldn’t possibly reach the man in at least five more steps, but he swung his weapon, raising overhead the narrow grip instead of the wide end.
“G-get out of here! Stop harassing us old people!”
‘My, my,’ thought the man, who simply ignored the old man who was confronting him aggressively. He grasped a nearby shelf with both hands, and put his weight on it to break it.
‘My, my,’ thought the woman as she saw this. She reached for her hip and pulled out the high caliber revolver from its holster.
Bang.
A terrible sound was heard.
Both the old woman crying on the floor and the man who was dangling from the shelf were extremely surprised at the thunderous sound which suddenly resonated in the room.
The old man brandishing the broom was killed before he had the time to be surprised. The .44 bullet struck the side of his head, and his tall and thin body collapsed on his side. Fresh blood flowed out from his head and stained the floor.
The woman stood, as expressionless as ever, still holding in her right hand the revolver from which she fired the single shot.
“Fuyaa,” the old woman let out a strange sound, and crawled noisily towards the corpse. She lifted and hugged the body while being bathed with the blood flowing non-stop from its head. She shook her husband.
“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
When she realized that no amount of thrashing would return her husband’s life, the old woman raised a long and high-pitched scream. To one’s ears, it sounded like a flute blowing through the forest.
The man, who has stopped wrecking the shelf, stood next to the woman who even now, still did not return the revolver to its place. He was about to speak with a puzzled face when,
“Ah!”
The old woman quickly stood up. Both of her hands and her chest were stained deep red, and a gentle smile graced her face.
“With this everything will be a mess. I have to clean up.” As she said this, she took the other broom from the pillar.
“I have to clea——”
Bang.
The woman released a second bullet which hit the old woman’s chest. Her small body blew up in a bizarre manner, hitting the pillar with a twirl before falling down on top of the old man’s corpse.
“……”
The woman said nothing, and returned the revolver in its holster. Silence came back inside the log cabin.
The man who exaggeratedly covered his ears spoke, still shocked.  “Master…. This is not like you.”
The woman faced him. “What do you mean by ‘not like me’?”
“Whatever the circumstances may have been, wasn’t it too early to open fire? There’s no merit in shooting down an opponent holding just a stick, you know.”
The woman looked at the broom the old man was holding, which now lay on the floor.
“Look well at the tip of that broom without picking it up.”
“……”
The man took a few steps and looked closely at the broom.
“There’s a small hole.”
“Now, lift it up slowly and carefully, and swing it down the wall on the other side,” said the woman. The man, who was puzzled all the more, swung the broom down with a whiff using his left hand.
Whoosh. Thump.
Something was released with full force from the tip and stuck to the wall. The surprised man approached the wall and saw a big fish hook piercing it.
“Eh?” He let out a surprised voice. The man turned around and the woman spoke to him,
“It’s probably poisoned so be careful not to touch it.”


“……”
The man’s expression hardened for a while. He looked at the two corpses on the dust cloth ruined with blood stains. Then suddenly, he put his left hand’s fingers inside his mouth. The woman saw this and spoke.
“It’s too late to throw it up, but don’t worry.”
“But…” The man removed his fingers from his mouth and turned around.
“There was nothing especially strange in the cups. If the antidotes were ineffective, both of us… no, all four of us would be dead from poisoning by now,” the woman explained nonchalantly. The man dropped his tense shoulders.
“…. I knew it. I have lost to you again, Master,” the man said with a smile. The woman only replied in a tone neither amused nor angry,
“Women are brave.”


“Well, let’s start,” the woman said.
The two soon began to search for something inside the room. They opened and investigated inside the ruined furniture, boxes and dresser. They searched underneath and on the lining of the table, inside the kitchen shelves, and checked for openings in the floorboards. They also investigated the blood-stained floor beneath the corpses.
When they finished probing the room, the two separated and started to search the other rooms of the log cabin.
Some time has passed since they began to search.
The woman was carefully inspecting all of the clothes in the bedroom dresser when she suddenly heard the man’s voice.
“Master! Master!”
The woman went out of the bedroom and headed towards the direction of the voice.
She joined up with the man who was in the corridor between the log cabin and the box that used to be a car. The man was a little excited.
“Master!”
“Did you find something?”
“Yes… but…”
“But?”
“I found something completely different from what we were looking for. Besides that, I feel like throwing up again…”
The woman let out a curious expression, and asked where the place is.
The man silently proceeded through the corridor and opened a wooden door.
The door of the box, that is.


“I see… Indeed, this is completely different from what we were looking for,” said the woman. ‘Isn’t it?’ said the man behind her said in a small voice.
The square box was like a long and narrow corridor. Light came in as the man opened the window in the roof. Inside were the ‘various things’ the old couple made — the ‘things they made using ingredients from nature’.
The first noticeable thing was a leg dangling from the ceiling. It was the smoked leg of a human, suspended with a hook from the thigh. Two pieces were dangling from the ceiling, neatly and equally spaced.
Skin was stretched over one surface of the wall without leaving a single gap. One can ascertain that it was a human’s, judging from the form of the navel and the nipples. It was stretched from the wrists, and circular patterns were drawn on it.
Pierced on the tip of an upright pole was a dried head with the eyes and mouth stitched up, reminiscent of the practice of old tribes that existed a long time ago. The head has shrunk very much compared to its original size. The hair on its head was carefully braided.
There was a sofa. It was a sofa for two, with wooden legs. However, human bones were glued all around it as decoration. The seat and the back of the sofa were all made from human hide. Above the back seat, four stuffed heads of humans were lined up — heads of two men and two women, alternating with each other. They were positioned in a way so that if two people were to sit on the sofa, all of their cheeks would touch together. From behind, it would look as if six people who get along well with each other were sitting side by side.
There was a pelt on the floor right in front of the sofa. The skin of the head and the entire body was peeled off all at once, and it looked much like a tiger or a bear pelt. But it was undeniably a human’s. It seemed as if it belonged to a big man.
There was a small round table. Its four legs were human legs. Lined up on top of it were two bowls cut up from skulls and forks made of finger bones.
There was a wooden shelf in the interior, above which were several important-looking big glass jars. Inside was some fluid and small heads. All were children’s. They were looking at the woman with their clouded, gaping eyes. The mouths were open and their tongues were sticking out. Thick fish hooks were piercing the tips. In another bottle, there were only the eyeballs of several people. There were so many that there was not enough space in between them. Upon closer inspection, ears were attached to the edge of the shelf.
“‘Fun’, eh…?” The man behind the woman remembered the old man’s words, and said this, looking like he was about to throw up.
“I see.”
The woman then started to investigate the room. She moved the furniture, peeling off the skin in the process. The man watched from the entrance with a disgusted expression as she explored the room with much enthusiasm.
She came back to the entrance when she was done.
“In any case, it seems like there are only corpses in this room,” the woman said without delay.
“Master… Don’t you find this sickening at all?”
“Corpses can’t attack, you know.”
“Well, that’s true but….”
The woman looked towards the room once more. “They killed a number of travelers. They must have collected the precious gold and silver they were holding somewhere. Look thoroughly. We came here for that.”
“Okay… But would we continue to search even in the night?”
The woman headed to the log cabin.
“Yeah. Let’s stay here for tonight.”
“Ugh…”
The man who was left behind took one more look inside the box. He met the eyes of a girl inside the glass jar. After waving his hand lightly towards the child, he turned away,
“Hmm?”
And looked back once more. 


“You search over there.”
The woman was searching the bedroom with about as much sense of shame as a burglar, and spoke to the man as he came in. As he was told, the man started to inspect the shelf beside the bed. The bed and the shelves were neatly crafted from wood, and would probably fetch good prices if sold but,
“Of course, we can’t take this with us,” the man said.
The two silently continued to search the bedroom. The man tapped the floorboards to see if there was space underneath, and when there was a portion that seemed hollow, he put his head in and looked underneath the floor. He lifted his face and shook his head.
“Let’s go to the next room,” the woman said.
When she was about to go out into the corridor with the man,
‘Thank you.’
She heard a voice. The woman asked, “Did you say something?”
“Hmm? Nope.”
‘Thank you.’
Again, the voice came, and the woman stopped in her tracks.
‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Thank you.’ 
The voices were heard one after the other.
It was like the rubbing sound made by leaves when a slightly strong wind blows through a forest. One would not be able to tell where specifically in the surrounding area the voices — the overlapping sounds of various people’s ‘Thank you’s —were coming from.
“What was that? A phonograph?” the woman turned around and asked the man, but the man only shrugged his shoulders.
“Ah—, the ‘mata’…? That sound is not from a phonograph. It’s a ‘mata’. I felt it earlier too, you know.”
“What do you mean by ‘mata’[1]?” the woman asked the man, slightly confused.
The man became hesitant for a moment, then finally spoke awkwardly, “Apparitions. Spirits. Ghosts. I’ve often heard and seen them since I was a child. I’m sure that the murdered travelers were expressing their gratitude. Ah, but that’s rare. You can hear them too, Master——, Master?”
In the middle of his explanation, the woman turned towards the other direction. He called out to the woman whose back quickly got smaller as she walked away.
“Hey?”
With quick strides, the woman passed through the living room containing the corpses, came out of the entrance lined up with the pretty potted flowers, and went outside, where the early summer sun was shining brightly.
“Master…?”
The man followed her out in confusion, and with a puzzled expression, faced the woman who was now sitting in the driver’s seat of the car.
The woman looked at the man sternly. “We’re leaving.”
“Eh? Eeeh? ——What about the treasure?”
“With this, travelers will no longer be attacked. That’s good enough. Moreover, we may not be able to find anything when it’s already night. Their purpose was probably to play with the dead bodies, so they might have thrown away the valuables.”
The man had a curious expression as he sat in the passenger’s seat. The small car shook.
“Well, that’s fine but… Master, don’t tell me you’re——”
“It’s nothing like that at all!”
The man asked, and the woman, with a cold face, declared with finality. She started the engine.
“Okay but…,” the man muttered and thought for a moment. “But, what are we going to do with this fellow who attached himself on my back?” the man asked. The woman, without changing expression, extracted the revolver from her right hip. The man did not see her do this and continued to speak.
“This guy probably wants to go with us——”
Bang.
The woman shot the space behind the man without warning, shattering the rear glass of the car in an instant.
“Eek!” The man’s right ear received the full thunderous echo of the shot, and twisted his body.
“……”
With eyes wide open, the woman in the driver’s seat asked the man who was staring at her, “Where is he?”[2]
“Ah…, he d-disappeared… I think…”
“I see. Then, let’s go.”
The woman hit the gears, and set the car off. The car climbed the slope and disappeared from view in no time.


Inside a forest, a small river was flowing.
Near this river was a house.
It was a well-made log cabin surrounded by fields and greenery. On its high entrance made of planks, pretty flowers were blooming inside a number of plant pots. One of the pots received a direct hit from a .44 caliber bullet, and the pot fragments and soil were scattered about.
There was something glittering amidst the brown splinters and black soil.
Lots of pretty jewels rolled down from the entrance of the deserted house, glittering as the early summer sun bathed them with light.



"
44,v6c5,6,5,"In the country where Kino and Hermes arrived in, there was only one gate that they could use.
They were told that the western gate was not approved for use by travelers, so they headed to the southern side using the road beside the walls. They requested a three-day stay from the gate sentry and were given a permit.
Kino pushed Hermes through the open gates.
Right after passing through the gates, they came out to a stretch of forest with thick trees lined up in a disorderly manner.
The ground and the single road were covered with fallen leaves, most of which were autumn foliage. The leaves, as well as Kino’s coat, shook as a cold wind blew.
When Kino was about to start Hermes’ engine, a lone man came running from the forest.
The man looked around thirty, and was wearing a thick vest for indoor use over a thin shirt. He looked at Kino, exchanged glances, and then put on a slightly dejected expression.
“What’s that about?” Hermes asked. Kino answered that she had no idea.
He walked towards Kino, his hands clasped together in front of him.
“Hey, miss traveler. Did you happen to meet my lover somewhere? Did she ask something about me? Did she leave any message for me?” the man asked.
Kino shook her head.
“Is that so…. You see, for some reason, my lover just up and disappeared from this country on a journey five years ago. However, she left word for me to wait for her because she’s definitely going to come back. I’ve been waiting forever,” the man spoke on his own accord without waiting to be asked. At that moment, a woman wearing an apron came running from behind. She had short hair and was about the same age as the man. She was carrying a warm-looking coat in her hands.
The woman spoke as she draped the coat around the man. “You will catch colds if you go out dressed like that. The weather’s already cold.”
“Ah, yes. I’m sorry. But I thought my lover has already come back. Too bad, it was a different person yet again,” the man said while inserting his hands into the sleeves of the coat.
‘Kino, look,’ Hermes said, and urged Kino to look into the forest. There was a single house surrounded by trees.
“Does everyone in this country live inside the forest?” Kino asked.
“No. Everyone lives in a town further north,” the man answered.
“This person is my housekeeper. She’s a hard worker so I don’t have to do a thing in the house and I could wait for my lover every day. She’s such a great help,” he said, and then sneezed loudly.
“See what I mean? Now, let’s go back,” the housekeeper said kindly.
The man asked the housekeeper, “Not yet? I wonder… when would she come home?”
“I’m sure she would someday. Now, let’s go,” the housekeeper gently pushed the back of the man, and they turned away.
Shortly, the man turned back to Kino. “Miss traveler, don’t you really know? You really haven’t seen my lover? You’re not trying to hide it from me now, are you?”
Kino shook her head once more.
“I see…”
The man dropped his shoulders, heartbroken, and walked towards the house. With a loud voice, the housekeeper told him to be careful not to fall over.
Then she whispered to Kino in a serious tone, “I’m really very sorry, miss traveler. He’s a bit strange. Whatever he asks you, it’s better if you tell him that you don’t know anything.”
“I see,” Kino said.
She then spoke gently, “Well, I should get going. Ah, if you’re going to the country’s center, you should go straight through here. The road is pretty bad, so be careful.”
Kino thanked her in return.
While looking at the backs of the pair returning into the forest, she started Hermes’ engine.


The next day.
Small drops of cold rain were falling down since morning.
Kino put up her coat’s collar and went around the town to take care of her traveling necessities. Afterwards, she decided to have lunch in a big cafeteria. Kino entered the shop pushing Hermes along, and parked him by the exit near the table where she was sitting.
A person talked to her, telling her that it was rare for travelers to come to their country. While Kino was leisurely drinking her tea, the residents gathered and surrounded her table to talk to her.
When she was asked whether there was anything she would like to know,
“We met a man living in the forest by the walls. What’s up with him?” Hermes asked.
Everyone’s faces turned pale. They became quiet, and their faces took on gloomy expressions. The atmosphere of the place suddenly became serious and depressing.
After a while, someone spoke. “Um, you see… we really feel sorry for that person.”
Everyone silently nodded.
“I believe I have a say about this matter,” a man around thirty spoke. He asked for permission to change seats with a person, and sat in front of Kino.
“Good day, miss traveler. Over ten years ago, I was good friends with that person. Right now, I work for the government,” he started to speak with a sad expression on his face.
With a gentle tone, he told her that until five years ago, this country was ruled by an oppressive king, and that there was a revolution to overthrow him.
“During that time, both of us were members of the police force. He was smart, skillful and a man of good character, and became a key person in the uprising. He was made leader of a unit assigned to break into the palace and assassinate the royal family. I was under his command,” the man said.
“He had a lover. It was a daughter of a farming family who lived at the outskirts of the country. He first met her when she came to town to sell vegetables. I was with him at that time…. It was one year before the revolution. She was a very beautiful woman with long hair. Everything went well between them, but they never got married. However…,” the man cut short his words, and took one big breath.
“The revolution drew near. I asked him what he planned to do about her when that time comes. He couldn’t give me an answer…. Soon we were told that the date and time of our attack has been decided. Only then would he let her know about their parting. We might die, but he couldn’t tell her what it is that we are going to do. It seems she parted with him against her will. The only thing he said to me was that he told her a ‘lie’…”
“I see. But the revolution was a success, wasn’t it?” Kino said, and the man nodded.
“We broke into the palace after beating down the guards. We found the car the king’s family was trying to escape with, and attacked it. While my comrades and I provided back-up, he closed in upon them and threw a bomb into the car. It blew up magnificently. You wouldn’t find a more heroic man anywhere.”
“And then?” Hermes asked from behind. The man continued, his face grief-stricken.
“And then we saw it…”
“Saw what?”
“The vehicle smashed into pieces, and inside, the sloppy remains of what used to be the king’s family — the king and queen, the two princes, and the princess. While everyone raised cheers of victory, we saw it. The dress the princess was wearing and the head that was blown off —— they belonged to his lover.”
“What?”
“The princess came to town in the guise of a farmer’s daughter… and induced a romantic relationship with him…. No one realized it…. He screamed like a crazy man.”
“Then you mean that man’s lover is already dead?” Kino asked. The man and all the people around nodded.
“He couldn’t endure the fact that he fell in love with the princess he was supposed to hate, and that he killed her with his own hands. He ignored reality and fell completely out of his mind. The truth is, since he was a hero, he would have been placed in an important position in the new government. However, he talked in delirium in the hospital, asking over and over again, ‘Where did she go?’ The doctor who was looking after him told him a lie: ‘Your lover has gone in a journey somewhere. But she told me that she would definitely come home, so wait for her, okay?’ In this country, ordinary people are not allowed to go beyond the walls. He didn’t even realize that obvious fact. He said, ‘Then, I’ll wait for her.’ and started to live in the forest…. Five years have passed since then,” the man continued.
“The government decided to provide him with an annual pension until his death. They built a house for him and hired someone to look after him. However, no one lasted with this sort of job. Life in the forest was so inconvenient. Moreover, it was heartbreaking, having to lie to him every single time. Everybody quit after a while…. We couldn’t blame them.”
“Then what about his housekeeper now?” Kino asked.
“Like you, miss traveler, she came from outside the country. Three years ago, when my subordinate and I were out for reconnaissance, we found travelers collapsed and on the verge of death near the walls. Some of these travelers immigrated. I thought it was a good thing that foreigners don’t know much about our circumstances, and we decided to hire her. She has been doing a good job ever since.”
“I see…”
“And it looks like she’s going to continue with her good work. There were no indications at all that he would get better. It might be better for him though…,” the man said with a dry smile.
A middle-aged woman standing behind gently continued.
“That’s why we all lie to our hero, and will continue doing so. That person will wait forever for his lover who will never come back.”


The next day, that is, the morning of the third day since Kino entered the country.
The weather was good. After breakfast, Kino made her arrangements and left towards the southern gate.
Kino carefully rode Hermes through the muddy forest road.
Soon they noticed a small horse carriage stranded in the mud. Aboard it was the man’s housekeeper.
“Kino, it’s your turn.”
“It can’t be helped. Well, soon we will be dirty all over anyway.”
With her boots covered in mud, Kino helped the carriage to escape. And then they rode together to the gates.
The housekeeper thanked them when they arrived before the gates. Then, Hermes told her that they learned about the previous day’s circumstances.
“Is that so…”
When Kino and Hermes were about to head to the gates, the housekeeper called out to them.
“Wait! I’d like to show you my gratitude. How about some tea? You can also wash your feet.”


Kino and Hermes were guided to the log house in the forest. The man was above the roof, mending it. The housekeeper told him that Kino helped her, and asked permission to let them in. The man gave his consent without a second thought.
After washing her boots and Hermes’ tires by a well, they were guided to a spacious room. When the man returned, the woman has already prepared tea. Steam rose appealingly from the cups lined up on the table.
“It has an interesting aroma, what kind of tea is this?” Kino asked.
“I have no idea, but it’s very delicious,” the man said and took his share from the side and began to drink it. He drank slowly,
“It’s delicious,” and said this to Kino with a smile. Kino also drank. She told him that it was good.
“Hey,” the man spoke to Kino and Hermes. “Miss traveler, you must be going to various places from here, right? If ever you happen to meet her——”
“Sure. We’ll tell her about you. That you’ve been waiting.”
“Yes, please do,” the man laughed happily.
“Oh my,” the woman who came holding biscuits suddenly cried out.
“Maybe someone arrived again at the gates? I think I heard the sound of an engine just now.”
The man stopped drinking his tea and stood up.
“I-it might be her! I’ll go!”
The housekeeper was flustered, and spoke to the man, “Please don’t forget to wear your coat!”
‘I know!’ the man said, but came out of the house without wearing his coat.
When the sound of a door closing was heard, the housekeeper sat down. She placed a warm-looking lap blanket on her knees, and soothingly drank her own tea.
“Is this really okay?” Hermes suddenly asked, and continued, “I didn’t hear anything like the sound of an engine.”
“Yes. If he were here, I wouldn’t be able to talk to you in peace. With this, he probably won’t be back for a while.”
Kino faced the housekeeper.
“It’s good enough as it is. My father, mother, and two siblings have safely escaped and are now happily living in a neighboring country. And as for me, I can stay by the side of the person I love,” the housekeeper said with a smile.
Kino slowly asked, “You are… this country’s former princess?”
The apron-clad woman silently nodded.
“I see, that’s a good thing, indeed. Please continue,” Hermes said.
Kino gazed into the woman’s eyes. The woman raised her teacup, drank, and then returned it to its place. Then she opened her mouth to speak.
“I was born as this country’s princess, and remained so until five years ago. I slipped into the people as a spy, and found out about the danger of an uprising. And later on, I met that person. Of course, I earned their trust to obtain information that I could report to my father. It is to learn the date of the planned attack beforehand, and escape to a neighboring country with our fortune.”
“……”
“Uh-huh.”
“But I, posing as a country girl, began to like him, and eventually fell in love with him. Except for my identity, nothing else was a lie in our relationship. Whenever possible, I would spend my time together with him. It was only a short time each day, but it was the most wonderful time of my life. Back then, I wished that those days would never end.”
The woman smiled and then composed herself once again.
“But it came to an end. That person told me the final information I needed.”
“It was when he parted with you without giving a reason, wasn’t it? By then, you knew that the revolution will soon take place,” Kino confirmed.
“Yes——. I conveyed that information to my father. I neither objected nor insisted to remain, and left the country together with my family. Our substitutes who were left behind carried out their duty, and everything went as planned. I forced myself to forget about him. I believed that we would never meet again.”
“But you came back.”
The woman nodded. “Being a spy, I learned many things while I was in the neighboring country. I wished with all my heart that he would not die in battle. That wish was granted. However, he was broken by the fact that he had killed ‘me’. I also learned that they needed a person who would look after him…. I worried for a long time before I came up with this solution.”
“I see,” Hermes said. The woman suddenly smiled as if she was remembering something.
“But it was so hard. I had to convince my parents and become a traveler…. When I entered the country, I had to be employed as a housekeeper. Even now, my parents are asking me to return,” the woman said, seemingly amused.
Kino asked, “What did he do when you met again?”
“He said this: ‘Ah. Please take care of me until she returns.’ —— it made me very happy.”
“Really?” Hermes asked.
“Yes,” the woman immediately nodded.
“He still loves me and waits for my return. And he needed me by his side. I lied to him when we met for the first time. And from here on, I will continue to lie to the person I love to stay with him. I am—— very happy.”
“… Thank you for telling us your story.”
“Yup, thanks.”
Kino and Hermes said. Then they heard the door opening as the man returned to the house. The housekeeper stood up and greeted the man shivering from the cold.
“It was different. The sentry told me that it was just the power generator being moved…. Nobody came…”
“Is that so?”
The housekeeper pulled a chair for the man. She gently wrapped the man’s shivering shoulders with the lap blanket she used earlier.
“When? I wonder when she would come home…,” the man muttered to himself.
“I don’t know when, but I’m sure she would come home someday,” the woman said.
The man looked at her and asked, “I’m scared. Do you think it’s possible that she has forgotten about me?”
The housekeeper’s hand became still as she was preparing a fresh serving of tea, and slowly shook her head. She smiled and answered the same way as everyone else in the country.
“No. There’s no way you will be forgotten… ever.”


The two bid them farewell, and Kino and Hermes passed through the gates.
“They’re gone. Will they really send my message to her?” the man asked, and the housekeeper told him with a bright face that it will be fine.
The moment they were about to enter the house, the man cried out, “There’s the sound of an engine! Someone has come again!”
Then he ran towards the gate.
“I’m sure that was just Hermes’——” The housekeeper stopped. She did not try to chase the man, and returned to the house.
She tidied up the cups on top of the table, and muttered to herself.
“Now, what would be great for lunch?”


“Kino, wait a bit. Look behind.”
They were already outside the country, a bit ways off the gates.
The engine has finished warming up, and Kino was about to straddle Hermes when he spoke. Kino looked back and saw the man trying to go out from the gates. The sentries were trying to stop him while he was desperately trying to say something. Eventually the sentries gave up and released him.
The man, who was now wearing a coat, ran at full speed towards where Kino is.
“Miss traveler! Please wait! There’s something I would like to tell you!” the man shouted. He was facing the ground, breathing roughly.
“There’s something I would like to tell you,” the man repeated, still looking below.
“You want me to send a message to your lover?” Kino asked and the man raised his face.
“No. I have a message for you. There’s just one last thing I want you to know.”
Kino looked up at the man who stretched to his full height. She looked at his cold face.
“It’s good enough as it is. I am happy. I don’t want to break anything anymore. Not the life of my friend who served as a spy to the royal family, not the memories of the people who did not know a thing, nor the revolution’s success and the new country’s system. And above all, not the life I have now with the person I love the most. —— I don’t want to destroy things as they are now. It’s good enough as it is.”
“……. You are…,” Kino stammered.
“A liar. Every single person in this country is a liar,” Hermes said.
The man smiled happily and made several small nods.
“Goodbye, I’m returning now,” the man said.
“Goodbye. Stay healthy, both of you.”
“Bye-bye, mister hero. Give my regards to your housekeeper.”
Kino and Hermes looked on as the man returned to his country. The worried-looking sentries met him and together, they passed through the gates.
When they were gone, Kino spoke.
“Shall we go?”
Hermes answered, “Yeah.”


"
45,v6c6,6,6,"A motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) was parked beside a stream. The motorrad, piled with traveling luggage on top and on both sides of its rear wheel, was propped on its center stand.
It was a small stream, narrow enough for a child to jump across. It created a slight depression on the flat earth.
It was a meadow flanked by mountains.
On the north and south sides were bare and scraggy mountain ranges, meandering alongside each other. There were small patches of white snow left on their peaks.
A wide and flat terrain was interposed between these mountain ranges. The stretch of green cover produced by various trees and grass occurred along with the grayish color of the mountains.
The rider was sitting on the grass opposite the motorrad. Both legs placed in front, hands stretched out behind, her eyes were looking up at the sky — to the warm spring sun and numerous clouds flowing on a backdrop of blue sky.
The rider was around her mid-teens. She had short black hair and a fearless expression on her face. She was wearing a black jacket fastened with a wide belt on the waist. On her right thigh was a holster for a revolver-type hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol). Behind her waist, there was another one — an automatic-type.
“What a pain…,” the rider said, lowering her gaze.
“Well what now, Kino? Have you come up with anything?” The motorrad from behind asked. The rider called Kino shook her head and answered.
“Nope —— none at all.”
“That won’t do,” the motorrad said.
Kino stood up, a somewhat disappointed look lingering on her face. Some blades of grass fell down as she lightly brushed off her bottom.
“I suppose so, Hermes. But for the meantime…,” Kino said as she approached the motorrad called Hermes, opening the box on one side of his rear wheel. She took out something that resembled a ball of long, coiled rope.
“What are you going to do?” Hermes asked. Kino lightly wore the hat placed on top of the carrier and moved towards the two nearest trees.
“Until I have thought of a good idea——”
“Until then?”
“I’ll sleep.”
“Huh?”
Kino uncoiled the ball of rope she was carrying. It was a simple net hammock made from rope. She skillfully tied it on the branches of the two trees and let it hang in the air. Then she removed the holstered persuader behind her waist.
“……”
Kino looked at it in silence for a while. The square-barreled persuader was almost bare though it was installed in its holster. Kino called this ‘Woodsman’.
She then placed Woodsman along with its holster in the belt in front of her stomach.
“The weather is warm and great. It’s perfect for an afternoon nap.”
Kino sat at the center of the hammock, placed her legs and upper body in it, and lay down, careful not to tip over. The hammock swayed a little and eventually settled down.
“I’ll be counting on you,” Kino instructed Hermes and placed her hat on top of her forehead.
“Good grief. What to do now?” Hermes mumbled and sighed while looking at Kino, who soon fell asleep.


A small puddle of stagnant water formed in one part of the stream. The blue sky was reflected a little at its center.
The water quietly trembled. Tiny ripples were born, gathering at the center of the puddle. The blue sky in it quivered.
“Kino!” Hermes shouted. Kino’s body slipped from the hammock, but she used her hands to fall in a safe position and lay on top of the grass. Her hat fell by her side.
“What is it?” Kino asked Hermes in a soft voice while she lay down, quickly surveying her surroundings. Hermes spoke with his usual tone,
“The ground. It’s shaking isn’t it?”
“The ground?” Kino seemed doubtful and was silent for a few seconds, and then she tilted her head.
“Maybe I don’t feel it yet,” Kino picked up her hat and stood up. Dust and leaves lightly fell from her body. With her right hand on her waist persuader, she asked Hermes, “An earthquake, perhaps?”
“No. The tremors are really weak, but gets stronger little by little.”
“Then…” Kino tilted her head.
“It’s simple. This means that something is slowly approaching,” Hermes said nonchalantly. Kino looked sideways to the east and to the west, and only saw the unchanging scenery.
“What do you mean by … ‘something’?” Kino asked.
“I don’t know,” Hermes answered.


After a while, the answer to this question came.
“It does shake. Even I can see it clearly now,” Kino said while looking at the ripples on the puddle.
As Kino spoke, Hermes called out to her and urged her to look at the forest in the eastern side.
Kino turned around and stood up. Then they saw ‘it’.


‘It’ was a country.
Like any other country, this one was surrounded by round and tall gray walls. Other than the wall not having seams on its material, there was nothing strange about its appearance.
Except that this country…
“It’s coming towards us.”
…was moving.
Kino stared, stupefied, at the country that suddenly appeared amidst the scenery in the east.
Beyond the trees, the top of the walls went in and out of view. It was slowly but steadily drawing near. In other words, it was going towards Kino’s direction.  The tremors were becoming stronger.
“The mystery’s solved,” Hermes said.
“No doubt… Well, what is that thing?” Kino asked, her eyes wide open.
“A country, isn’t it obvious?” Hermes answered, not sounding the least bit shocked.  “If you keep on daydreaming, you’ll get run over.”
“I suppose you’re right.”
The moving country proceeded straight ahead. A low rumble like the howling of wind could be heard. Kino hurriedly removed the hammock, rolled it up and put it away in the luggage box. She put on her hat, strapped on her goggles, went astride Hermes, and started the engine.
Kino launched Hermes. She rode through the meadows and tried to go around to the right of the advancing country. She stopped just beside the anticipated route of the country.
Kino observed the country, which has gotten much closer.
It was surrounded by circular walls and had a guard post just like any other country.  It was not so big; one can probably go across it in one leisurely afternoon walk. But this country was moving. It approached Kino and Hermes with a low rumble reminiscent of distant thunder.
Kino, whose angle of view was gradually getting higher, spoke with a slightly loud voice, “Amazing… the country is moving. It’s my first time to see something like this.”
“Same here,” Hermes agreed and added, “What are we going to do, Kino? Are you giving it a thumbs-up?”
Kino looked at Hermes. “That may be a good idea…”
“But, you can get attacked all of a sudden.”
“It’s a gamble, huh…? Well, a gamble it is. I wasn’t able to come up with anything anyway.”
And so Kino revealed herself a little from the shadow of a shaking tree and waved her hands, trying to get the country’s attention.
The moving country approached even more, mowing down the trees in its path.
Underneath the walls was a thick foundation. Further below were things that looked like gigantic caterpillars, as wide as a house, and installed with countless centipede legs. The legs tread on the ground and slowly turned. The upturned tree trunks rolled beneath the caterpillar, getting pulverized in the process.
The moving country obstructed the sky. The spring sun that was slightly inclined to the north was hidden from view, and Kino was covered in shadow.
“It’s like seeing a mountain move,” Hermes muttered.
Amidst the increasing noise and tremors,
“Are you a traveler?” a man’s voice reached Kino and Hermes. It sounded as if it came from somewhere nearby, so Kino looked around her in surprise.
“Oh, I’m speaking from inside the country. It’s just that you can hear it as if it’s coming from nearby. —— If you’re a traveler, do you want to enter the country?”
Kino waved her hands once more.
“Okay, then please wait for a while.” 
So said the voice. The noise and tremors quietened for a while. Kino and Hermes looked ahead, and one last loud noise was heard before the country came to a stop.


Kino and Hermes were in front of a door. The gate, which served as the entrance to the country, opened before them and became a slope. Because it was thick and massive, the top of the door sank into the ground. Beyond it was a passage; a hill road climbing into the country.
A small car appeared, descending the hill road. It ran accompanied only with the gentle hum of its motor, with a lone man riding inside. He was wearing a white shirt and necktie with a light green work jacket on top. The man in his forties looked like a good-natured person in all respects.
“Hello, traveler. I am this country’s immigration inspector. I am also the tour guide, police officer, and so on. In our country, government workers are given a variety of posts, you see,” the man said as he stopped the car in front of Kino and Hermes. Kino and Hermes introduced themselves as travelers.
“Um, is this thing… a country after all? Where is it headed?” Kino asked, and the guide nodded.
“Yes, indeed. Inside, my brethren are living in peace. We are constantly migrating. Right now, we are going along these plains towards the west.”
As usual, Kino asked for permission to stay in the country for rest and recreation.
The guide readily consented, saying that guests are always welcome to their country.
“Well, how many days are you planning to stay with us?”
Kino dropped Hermes a glance and then faced the guide.
“We would like to stay for five to ten days.”


“And that over there is the nuclear power reactor. The large quantity of steam the reactor produces moves the generator, and the electric power generated moves the country and also serves as our energy supply.”
The guide said, pointing towards the enormous equipment beyond a thick glass pane. Kino was seated in the passenger seat while Hermes was riding on the car’s loading platform. The car was parked on a wide road, surrounded with a glass-walled interior.  The minute vibrations accompanied with low hums continued.
The guide pointed to a group of monitors installed above the glass panes. Shown in the monitors were people working beside the gigantic equipment, completely covered with full-body clothing.
“That machine works on its own, and the people here have almost nothing left to do. We only have to observe. The fuel placed in this container is guaranteed to last for several hundred years, so we don’t even need spares. The important thing is to maintain and clean the caterpillars and the engines. Now, let’s proceed.”
The car moved quietly. While they were riding, Kino spoke. “Since when did everyone start living here?”
“You’re asking for the country’s history, eh? The truth is we don’t fully understand as well. As to whether someone found this migration apparatus and chose to live here instead of in a country, or whether our ancestors lived in it since ages past; we could no longer remember. It’s a mystery, but we really don’t mind not knowing about it.”
“Do you really have to move around all the time? Can’t you settle down once you found some good land?” Hermes asked. The guide gave him two reasons as to why they should be constantly on the move.
“First, there’s the question of the nuclear power reactor. Once stopped, restarting it will take some time. If we stop moving for a long amount of time, the excess amount of temperature and energy will accumulate. To protect ourselves against this, we spend the energy by making the caterpillar be constantly on the move. For instance, letting it move at about the speed of a walking person.”
“I see,”
“Uh-huh,”
Kino and Hermes interjected. The guide gave a merry laugh.
“The other reason is the same as a traveler’s —— to see a variety of sceneries; sceneries that change. We have grown fond of this, so we continue to migrate. In other words, all of our citizens are travelers.”
“I see… that’s a good thing. Is your route decided?”
“No. We continue to roam around this enormous continent. Occasionally, we would be on a desert or a prairie, and at times, we would be running along a dangerous slope, prepared for the inconvenience it will give us. We rarely come across the same place twice, and even if we did, it will probably not be within anyone’s lifetime. We will probably never settle in a single place for eternity.”


The car carrying Kino and Hermes went along the path inside the country. The car rode towards the country’s center on a road that was only wide enough to allow two vehicles to pass each other. There were intersections and traffic lights here and there.
The car ascended a switchback hill road. After this climb, the square light of the exit could be seen just straight ahead. The car came out and the sky was revealed.
It was the country’s top floor. Underneath the blue sky was a green space encircled by low walls. It was a huge park, complete with soil, grass lawns, and forests. Some of the trees were so large that their ages must easily exceed a hundred years. There was even a river and a small lake.
Like any other park, this one was filled with people strolling, exercising, or taking an afternoon nap on the lawn, or enjoying a boat ride in the lake.
“This top floor is the only place where we can enjoy the sunlight. It has become the residents’ place for relaxation. It’s like our courtyard. To be fair to everyone, all of us, including our president, live in the lower floors. However, the president lives by the side where there is a view of the streets.”
“I see.”
The car then followed the hill road and climbed to a road leading to the top of the wall. As it is, the top of the wall served as a road. It was rather narrow, bordered left and right with nothing but sturdy yet low railings. From the left side, the country’s greenery, and from the right, the earth’s greenery could be seen way, way below.
“You’d better not look if you’re afraid of heights,” Hermes said.
When the car exited to the eastern walls, that is, opposite to where the country is headed,
“Wow!”
“Amazing!”
Kino and Hermes raised their voices in awe. On the ground at the eastern side were traces of the country’s movement.
The enormous caterpillars dug out the ground, treading on and crushing each tree and flowering plant underneath, exposing the bare earth. The wide brown line between the mountain ranges stretched, and faded until it can no longer be seen.
“I suppose this much is expected,” the guide said with a rather bitter look on his face.
“It really pains me that we had to leave such enormous traces on the face of Mother Nature for the sake of our enjoyment. I’m sure it’s a nuisance. But if man were to walk, he had to leave footprints.  We have come to the conclusion that this much is inevitable, and I only wish that strong, new blooms be born over this earth once more.”


It was a small but clean room.
There was a bed, a western-style dresser which now displayed Kino’s coat, a folding chair and desk. Everything was fixed securely.
There were no windows in the room; it was completely enclosed with walls. In one wall, a big monitor was installed. Half of it displayed the morning scenery, and the other half displayed darkness, indicating the current time of the day.
Hermes was parked right beside the entrance, occupying half of the free space. He was propped on his side stand and fixed with a belt so he would not fall. There was not a single speck of dust in the room.
Kino came out of a door beside the room. She was wearing a pair of blue pajamas with ‘Room No. 41’ printed above the chest. She briskly wiped her wet hair with a towel, hung it on her neck, and sat on the bed.
Kino spoke. “Without a doubt, this is the first time I’ve seen a country with so much hot water I can use.”
“Since that water is being recycled, I bet it will end up as your drinking water tomorrow,” Hermes teased.
“I couldn’t care less. It’s still better than drinking muddy river water filtered with a cloth.”
“I guess so. By the way, what’s up with those pajamas?”
“They’re for guests. I went ahead and borrowed one. There were also lots of towels.”
Just as Hermes interjected, the room shook as if there was a weak earthquake.
“I wonder if it can climb over rocks, too. —— Ah, it stopped. Do you think it’s broken?”
“It only moves this much. Amazing, huh?”
Kino hung the towel on the wall and took out Woodsman hidden underneath her pillow. She extracted it once from its holster and looked at it. Then she put it back to its hiding place.
“Do you think things would work out?”
“Who knows? We’ll know in four or five days. —— I’m going to sleep.”
Kino rolled on the bed and wrapped herself with the thin blanket.
“Oh, Kino——”
“Let’s leave chatting for tomorrow. Good night,” she said to Hermes, and then, “Um…, ‘turn off’ ‘all lights’.”
The lights in the room and the monitor turned off. 
“A clean bed… white sheets…”
In the darkness, Kino murmured and soon fell asleep.


The next morning.
Kino got up and turned on the lights and the monitor. The monitor now displayed the outdoor scenery — the forest and the southern mountain range bathed with the morning glow.
Hermes spoke as she got up from bed, “Good morning, Kino.”
“… That’s rare, Hermes. Good morning.”
Kino headed to the bathroom, Hermes speaking to her back.
“I wasn’t able to say it last night——”
Kino disappeared into the bathroom…
“Wha…!”
… and let out a surprised voice from inside.
“If you sleep without drying your hair completely, it will look terrible the next morning.”


“What about work?”
“Nothing. ‘The machine already works wonderfully by itself, and even if there’s any work, we wouldn’t let a guest do it,’ he said a little angrily, and added, ‘More than that, you should go sightseeing or relaxing.’”
Kino and Hermes stood idly under the blue sky. Kino pushed Hermes until the entrance to the park and propped him on his stand. Kino was clad in her jacket, but she was not wearing her hat or goggles. She also removed her persuaders along with their holsters.
“It’s so comfortable, isn’t it? Don’t you feel like taking an afternoon nap?” asked Hermes, who was not loaded with luggage today.
“That may be a good idea.”
Kino pushed Hermes and entered the park.
The sunbathing residents talked to Kino when they saw her. Everyone heard of Kino and Hermes’ arrival in the news last night. They thanked her for coming, and admired her for being able to travel alone on a single vehicle.
Kino borrowed a deck chair and spent time leisurely looking at the sky. At lunchtime, she climbed up to the marketplace at the center of the park and heartily ate lunch made from farm-grown vegetables and chicken.
After lunch, Kino observed a group of ten-year-olds assembled at the entrance to the park. Tens of children gathered, carrying toolboxes with them. They were led to the inside of the walls.
She asked a nearby resident what it was about.
“Oh, they will be creating a mural as commemoration for this year’s group of graduating schoolchildren.”
“A mural?”
“That’s right. Everyone will paint a big picture while riding a gondola suspended from the wall.”
Then the resident urged her to see it, as it was supposedly an interesting sight.
“What are we going to do, Kino?”
“We’re free anyway and I’m interested.”
“Okay. If we’re going to ride on top of the walls, we don’t have to ride on a car.”
Kino started Hermes’ engine and climbed the hill road towards the road on top of the wall. The wind was rather strong.
A large crane vehicle was parked on the north side of the wall. With two cranes, an oblong gondola could be lowered along the guide rails stuck on the wall. Beside it, the children were lined up, wearing helmet and lifelines, happily yet somewhat nervously receiving their instructions.
Kino asked the teachers permission to observe, and stopped Hermes as much as she can at the edge of the road. So that he wouldn’t fall, Kino tied and fixed him on the railings, and tied the lifeline she borrowed beside it.
The children rode the gondola, and it was slowly lowered down. They started to daub paint on the gray walls with big brushes. They carefully traced after a draft that was already drawn on the wall.
“I can’t see what they’re drawing from here.”
And so, the teachers showed Kino and Hermes a monitor. The image painted was a huge snow-peaked mountain range with a tropical rainforest and a group of wild animals before it. It was a huge picture; one would wonder whether the animals were drawn life-size. It was almost complete. Only a small draft drawn at the bottom was left.
“After discussing among themselves, all of the pupils will draw the scene that left them the deepest impression. This scene was a land we passed by four years ago. It was a really beautiful and memorable place. Everyone would climb up the walls and gaze tirelessly at it. It will be completed in a few days. By the way, when I was a child, we painted the picture of a huge crater we found in the wilderness.”
“What are you going to do with this picture after its completion?”
“First we will take a picture, and then we will varnish it. It will adorn the wall for five hundred days — until the graduation of the next batch of students.”
“I see.”
Kino leisurely sat across Hermes and watched the picture being drawn.


It soon became dark, and the evening sun set in the direction they were headed.
Kino and Hermes viewed the sun setting between the mountain ranges through the monitor in their room.


The next day, that is, the morning of the third day since they entered the country.
Kino woke up at dawn. The sky reflected in the monitor was dull and slightly cloudy, foretelling the rain that will fall at any time. Hermes seemed like he was enjoying as he changed channels.
[The work on the mural will be postponed for today.]
So said the announcement about the previous day’s mural.
[It seemed that even the traveler was really interested in it.]
“I didn’t notice.”
“Well, well.”
A big, blurry image of Kino and Hermes gazing at the work on the mural was shown.
Kino proceeded with her usual light exercises. Then she practiced with her persuaders and started their maintenance afterwards. She disassembled the revolver ‘Canon’ and the automatic Woodsman, applied oil, loaded them with bullets, and returned them to their holsters.
Then she took out the disassembled rifle-type persuader tied on the cover of her bag. After the maintenance and operation check of its two parts,
“Are you going to use that?”
“Who knows?” was her answer to Hermes’ question. She carefully wiped the lens of the scope, disassembled it again and returned it to the bag.


After taking a shower, Kino pushed Hermes along and headed to the restaurant. She first went out to the corridor and out to the streets. On the streets, she exchanged greetings with the people headed towards their workplace.
Upon securing Hermes beside a desk, Kino received her breakfast of vegetables. All the plates were made deeper than usual, and can be screwed into the trays. Moreover, the trays were fixed on the tables.
Having found Kino, the guide who was also the inspector, the police officer, and so on, asked permission to sit in front of Kino. He asked about Kino’s impression of the country, to which Kino answered with all honesty. The guide laughed cheerfully.
After finishing her after meal tea, and when Kino was about to stand up, an alarm went off in the dining hall. It was a high-pitched sound painful to the ears. The red light on the wall started to rotate.
“What is it?”
“A fire?”
“Go to your work posts. Don’t trip from panic,” the police (aka guide, inspector, etc.) ordered the people around him, and then turned to answer Kino and Hermes’ questions.
“This alarm means that a nearby country was detected along our route. I will be going to my post as an ambassador…. Do you want to observe?”


The alarm changed into slow music, and an announcement instructing the commoners to go to their rooms flowed out.
Riding the man’s car, Kino and Hermes arrived in a room with ‘Driving Command Post’ written on it, and entered. Inside was a space similar to a ship’s bridge, with a number of people seated on their seats in front of control boards. In front, several large monitors were lined up.
Among the seated people wearing the same jackets, there was a middle-aged woman sitting in a comfortable chair. She saw the man who was now serving as an ambassador, and spoke to him with a laid-back tone.
“So you’ve come. We’ll be counting on you. —— Oh, miss traveler. Hello there. I am this country’s president. Please, enjoy your observation.
Kino returned a bow. She sat in the seat offered to her, and was told to fasten her seatbelt. Hermes was secured beside her.
Kino and Hermes’ gaze fell into the group of monitors lined up before them. A number of them were displaying the situation outside the country.  There were also some displaying the mural. And at the center, on a big monitor similar to a movie screen, the scenery right ahead was displayed.
Spread below the cloudy sky was the same scenery as two days before, a forest between two mountain ranges. And beyond this forest was a country.
“This again… of all things,” the man said in surprise.
“Quite worrying, isn’t it?” the president said.
Its wall was made of stones put together. There was nothing unusual about it. However, it was not circular. It stretched across on a straight line — one end extended up to the northern mountain while the other end extended to the south. It was like a dam, completely obstructing the plain.
“It’s a ‘blockade’, huh?” the man said. Slowly, the walls inside the screen became closer.
The monitor zoomed in, and they saw soldiers lining up cannons above the walls in a state of panic. A directing arrow pointed at it on top of the terminal screen. The man took a microphone in his hand. He asked to have a discussion with their representative through the wireless.
Eventually, a radio correspondence mixed with noise began. A man, who claimed to be the general of the other side asked, ‘What in the world are you?!’
“We are a country in constant migration,” the ambassador explained simply. “We have a request of you. Since we are traveling due west, we would like permission to go across your country.”


The person on the other end of the line was at a loss for words, and then replied that they could not possibly allow such a thing.
“I knew it,” Hermes muttered.
“But you see, your country is completely blocking off the plain with your walls. With that, our country has no place to go through,” the man said.
‘This is a territory our country expanded into with great effort over a long period of time. A foreign country does not have any right to complain against it. If you get any closer, you will be violating our territorial rights and we will commence attack,’ the reply came.
“We have no intention of fighting a pointless war with you. We only want to pass through. Please tell us which part of your country will be all right for us to traverse.”
‘How can we allow something like that!’ the angry reply was heard.
“Prepare the dome. Set up two cameras. One to the rear left, and one within the country,” the man gave out instructions to the people sitting before him.
The small monitor displayed the road on top of the wall. Its center split, from which several armored panels resembling fingernails slowly appeared. The panels built a huge dome together with the top of the wall.
‘I see. We do not wish to fight a pointless battle either, but if that is your intention, you leave us no choice but to resolve this situation using the military power we have for defending ourselves,’ came the response from the wireless. After that, a war was officially proclaimed, and soon, the lined up cannons on the wall spouted flames all at once.
“What a troublesome bunch…,” the man muttered, and soon, the monitor reflected the walls and the dome being hit by the shells. It was covered with the explosion’s flame and smoke which soon cleared away. The wall as well as the dome was only slightly burned, and no sound or tremor even reached the command post.
Amidst being struck by cannon fire without restraint, the moving country continued to get closer to the walls.
“It’s about time. Please prepare the cameras.”
At the man’s orders, one part of the wall opened, from which two spheres were sent flying out. Like two gigantic soccer balls, the black and white spheres pulled a wire and drew a parabolic trajectory.
One fell inside the forest, while the other one went over the walls of the other country and fell inside. It crushed a wooden hut into pieces, rebounded, and fell on top of a field.
The images captured by the spherical cameras were displayed in the monitor.
The first one reflected the image of the whole country as seen from the rear left as it slowly approached the walls ahead while being bombarded with cannon fire.
The other one displayed the scenes inside the country before them: the interior of the tall walls, the soldiers transporting the cannon shells, the western walls which could be dimly seen from afar. To the north, a town crowded with stone houses and buildings could be seen. Other than this, almost the whole expanse of the country was comprised of plains and fields.
After a while, a rush of soldiers headed to the camera, attacking it with rifle fire and grenade blasts. As a result, the image flickered and shook. 
“Your excellency, it seems that we can pass through the fields. We wouldn’t have to stomp on so many houses,” the man said to the woman who was leisurely drinking tea in her chair.
“That’s great then. Let’s do that,” the president said without a care. The man pushed the microphone’s call button.
“Now then, we will pass through the rural area at the southern side of your country. Since we will increase our speed, I believe it wouldn’t take half a day. Please rest assured.”
‘We won’t allow you to do such a thing. Even without our cannons, our staunch walls will protect us,’ came the reply. Ignoring this, the man gave out orders to the people seated before him.
“Cut down the walls. There at the left side, at the area where no cannons are lined up would be good.”
“Roger,” they replied. A ray of light appeared in the monitor. The bright yellow light fired from the moving country and extended straight towards the walls.
“……”
“It’s a high-energy laser. It’s similar to Woodsman’s laser sight,” Hermes gave an explanation to Kino who was staring in surprise.
The laser hit, then ran from the top to the bottom of the wall. Then it moved to the left, then upwards. It cut through the stone wall as if it was paper.
‘W-what did you just do?!’
At the same time as the general’s impatient voice, the cut-off portion of the wall slowly collapsed to the front. During its fall, the stones at the top crumbled down and simultaneously collapsed to the ground like building blocks. Dust fluttered about.
“We have made ourselves a path.”
“Then let us pass through.”
So went the conversation between the man and the president. The moving country paused once and then started to move to the left. This was captured by the rear left camera. Amidst the tireless attacks of the cannon, the massive country covered with black smoke headed precisely towards the hole that it opened, then began to proceed straight ahead once more.
‘What a despicable thing to do! More importantly, if you were to cross our country, shouldn’t you pay a price for it?’ came the response from the wireless.
“Even if you say that… there’s nothing our country can give you. I’m truly sorry. To not cause you further trouble, we will leave immediately,” the man answered.
The wires were coiled to retrieve the two cameras, and then the moving country trampled on the mountain of rubble which used to be the wall, and entered the hole it opened for itself. It was only wide enough, without even allowing a single car to fit in the gaps on both sides.
After passing through the walls, the moving country started to traverse the country. The bombardments have stopped, and only the soldiers looking up with dumbstruck faces were displayed in the monitor.
The moving country violently ran through the distinct green line of fields in the spacious country. It dug its caterpillar legs into the ground and slightly increased its speed to that of a running person.
There was a house straight ahead. It was a large house, and on its side was a silo built for storing harvested crops.
“Ah, there’s a house.”
At the same time as the man’s remark, the general’s voice was heard, ‘There’s a house ahead! Stop advancing!’
“General, it’s really rude of us, but please tell the people in the house to evacuate since it’s dangerous.”
The country did not slow down. A truck arrived beside the house, and soldiers rushed in. They took out several people. Among them, there was an old woman who refused to get on the truck. She turned to the moving country and shouted something hysterically. She threw stones that didn’t reach their mark, and sat down in protest.
“How troublesome,” the man said towards the awe-inspiring figure of the woman who remained seated in place.
“It’s dangerous. Please move out of the way. You will get run over. Please move.”
The woman did not budge, and the moving country drew nearer. This time, the man directed his words to the soldiers.
“Soldiers over there. It is your duty to protect your citizens. Please help this person.”
Eventually, a number of soldiers carried off the woman to the truck. The truck ran off in a hurry. At the same time, the soldiers fired their persuaders from the windows of the truck.
The moving country trampled on the farm family’s silo, storehouse, main house, garage, and a large tree one after the other. After a while, they passed without a single jolt. In the rear monitor, the remains of the structures could no longer be distinguished.
“It seems we have passed through without much incident. That’s a good thing,” the man said as he sat leisurely in his chair and drank the mug of tea handed to him. Kino also accepted hers and drank.
‘To destroy the land we are blessed with in such a manner. Do you not consider the trouble, harm, and sorrow you cause the people of countries you step on? Do you not have that minimum consideration a human should be capable of?’
In reaction to the general’s words, Hermes asked Kino in a whisper, “They say such a thing, but what do you think?”
“… Let’s pretend we didn’t hear that,” Kino answered.
“I suppose you’re right.”


When the western wall was already clearly displayed at the center of the monitor, the man relaxing in his chair was called out by the people sitting in front.
“It seems like small missiles are being fired towards the side of the walls to where the mural is located. The Board of Education and the parents are asking us to deal with it.”
“Eh?”
The man got up and looked at the terminal screen. There was a large, damaged portion on the mountain part of the mural located at the wall on the right side. Another monitor reflected small four-wheel drives pulling platforms carrying pairs of small, anti-tank missiles. From there, the missiles, pulling their guide wires and trailed with black smoke, leapt straight towards the mural[1]. After a small explosion, the lower part of the mural was burned off.
“So it was on purpose. What a cruel harassment. The children will be very sad. —— Shall we attack the vehicle with the laser?” the man asked the president. The president pondered for a moment, then asked the man,
“Can’t we just destroy their launchers?”
“That will be impossible. It is too strong. What shall we do?”
“We don’t want to have any more casualties. We’ll just have to explain to the children afterwards,” the president said, and the man turned to the front with a disappointed face.
“What about shooting them with a persuader?” Kino asked, and the man turned around.
“You mean sniping? That makes sense, but there is no one in our country who can do such a feat.”
“If it’s all right with you, allow me to do it,” Kino said.


“But it’s very dangerous.”
“I will be fine as long as I don’t get hit by cannons.”
“You don’t have to go this far, Miss Kino.”
“It’s my gratitude to you for letting me ride, and also for the sake of the children.”
The man and Kino exchanged words. The two were on the road on top of the wall with the mural, within the interior of the dome armor.  The car they have ridden up to this place was beside them.
Kino, clad in her black jacket and hat, was carrying the already assembled automatic rifle Flute. She slapped a magazine containing nine rounds inside the rifle, and loaded the first shot.
“It looks like they’re yet to attack. The platforms containing the missiles are following the vehicles. It seems like they will have to stop first before attacking.”
The man showed Kino the monitor he was holding. The four-wheel drives rode in a queue, lined up horizontally, then stopped. The soldiers rotated each pair of missile launchers on the vehicle platforms to the outside, targeting the mural.
“Please open it,” Kino said, and the man pushed a switch on the monitor. A small door made for people to pass through slid open. From there, Kino held Flute between her arms, and crept above the road. The man sent her a lifeline from behind.
A weak wind blew from outside. Kino crawled to the edge of the wall as much as she could, and slowly exposed a bit of Flute’s barrel through the gap between the railings.
“Miss Kino. It looks like they’re going to fire soon.”
The man’s voice was heard from behind. Kino remained prostrate, aiming below. Through the scope, she saw a soldier peeking from a launcher placed beside the vehicle. Kino released the safety.
Shrill gunshots were heard in succession.
And at that moment, the soldier at the side of the vehicle took his eyes off the equipment in surprise. The huge lens of the equipment was shot out and destroyed.
Kino destroyed the lined up launchers one after another. However,
“!”
The last one was able to fire missiles before she destroyed it. Along with a black smoke, it drew closer to the mural below her. Kino got up.
She exposed her body in a half-rising posture. The monitor zoomed in on her form carrying Flute. There was no sound, but the tremor from the recoil, as well as the empty cartridges being ejected indicated that Kino was rapid-firing the rifle. And in another monitor, two missiles flying towards the mural exploded in mid-air.


Taking a good look from the sky, one would see two walls parallel to each other stretched between two mountains. Within the borders was a country.
Far south from the center populated with many buildings was an expanse of green fields. Over there was a perfectly straight and wide brown line. At its tip was an enormous dome, slowly proceeding ahead.
The western wall was cut down with a laser, and slowly crumbled down.


The moving country trampled on the remains of the wall. The man took the microphone.
“We have successfully passed through. We are truly sorry for making such a ruckus.”
‘We demand your apology and remuneration for the walls, houses, vehicles, and fields you destroyed. Our country has every right to ask for this. Cease your movement and respond to our negotiations,’ the general’s voice was trembling in anger.
“No matter what the reason is, the one who commenced the war earlier was you, and since we haven’t lost, we have no reason to give you any compensation. We will probably never come to this land a second time. We do not hold a grudge against you, and wish that many plants will grow once more over this land, and that you spend the rest of your lives in peace. That is all, and goodbye,” the man said calmly, and cut off the correspondence.


The next day.
That is, the morning of the fourth day since Kino entered the country.
The country, with the rising sun behind them, once more proceeded at a speed of a walking person. The dome could no longer be seen. The mountain range at the southern side was already gone, and an endless prairie continued to the west and south.  Thin streaks of clouds were floating high in the clear sky.
“If it only takes that much power, then I suppose it’s a simple thing for you to destroy, subjugate, and take control of foreign countries,” Kino said. She was wearing her black jacket, hat, and holsters on her right thigh and back. Her goggles were hanging down her neck.  Hermes beside her was piled up with all her luggage. They were on the road inside the country.
“Well, it sure looks that way, but——” The guide (aka ambassador, inspector, etc.) said. Behind him was a car.
“We do not wish for such a life. We are still sufficiently happy. It’s not like we’re starving. If we do that, we would turn the whole world into our enemies — a foolish thing to do. But what you have witnessed yesterday is a rare thing. Not so much as destroying countries, we often tread on streets, demolish dikes, and dig up graves.”
“Even so, you would still continue your migration?” Hermes asked, and the man nodded.
“Yes. We have decided that such things are inevitable. No matter what kind of human or country, its existence will bring trouble to other people or countries to some extent.”


“Thank you for having us. We would have stayed longer, but since it was decided that you will be taking the southern route, it can’t be helped. It’s quite regrettable.”
“There’s one last thing I would like to tell you,” the man began. “Miss Kino. Though it may come off as rude, please allow me to say this.  Don’t you want to become a citizen of this country, to stay and travel with us? We would gladly welcome you.”
“It’s a real pity, but we would like to continue traveling on our own,” Kino said decisively. The man, as if he was expecting it, smiled gently.
“I see. Please take care.”
Kino expressed her thanks for the fuel, ammunition, and portable rations. The man conveyed to her the children’s appreciation for what she has done.
An announcement stated that they will be stopping soon. The country stopped moving and the door slowly opened.
Kino once more exchanged words of thanks and parting with the man. Then she descended down the door without starting Hermes’ engine. When she has landed on the ground and looked back, the door was already closing, gradually hiding the man’s waving figure from view.
Kino started Hermes’ engine. Along with its rumble, she slowly began to run westward.
The country moved and turned ninety degrees to the south. When Kino looked back, there, above the slightly damaged mural, the helmet-wearing children were lined up, waving their hands.


A motorrad was running due west on a level prairie.
The boisterous sound of its engine reverberated, scaring away birds.
“It’s been a long time.”
“Yeah. Just as I thought, I still preferred this way.”
Hermes and Kino said.
“That was an interesting country. And such a nuisance, too.”
“Which one are you referring to?” Kino asked with a smile.
“Both of them, I suppose. That ‘blockade country’ obstructed the plains on purpose so that they could extort money and goods from everyone who wanted to go through.”
“It was too high a price. If only they asked for anything other than Woodsman, like labor or something, I would have gladly complied just so I could pass through.”
“I wonder…  Right about now, they must be repairing that wall desperately.”
“Maybe,” Kino said while laughing, then muttered casually, “I wonder where that country will go to from now on…”
“Who knows? But there’s one thing I can say for sure.”
“… What?” Kino asked, and Hermes immediately answered.
“For several hundred days, your image posing with a rifle will decorate their mural.”
“Isn’t that’s a bit… embarrassing?”
“A nuisance?” Hermes asked.
“Not to that extent, I suppose,” Kino answered.



"
46,v7c1,7,1,"A motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) was riding through a wilderness in the middle of winter.
It was a barren land of rock solid earth and craggy hills extending in all directions. Occasional chilly gusts form tiny brown whirlwinds. There was not a single drop of moisture in the atmosphere, rendering the skies clear except for the dimly floating sun. The temperature was way below freezing point.
The motorrad proceeded through this abode where not even a pretense of a road could be seen. It had boxes attached on both sides of its rear wheel, the top of which was stacked with a bag, a sleeping bag and cans of fuel and water. To avoid it from freezing, the amount of water in the cans was reduced.
Its rider wore thick winter clothing of brown jacket and trousers on top of her normal clothes. She wore a boa winter cap with flaps that completely hid her cheeks. Her hands were covered with thick gloves, 
while a scarf was wrapped around her face. The yellow single-lens goggles over her eyes concealed her expression.
A rifle-type persuader (Note: A gun) fitted with a scope was hanging from the front of her body with a leather strap.
“Cold,” the rider mumbled through her scarf.
“Was that the forty-fifth time?” the motorrad answered.
“Cold cold cold cold cold…”
“Okay, okay.”
“… It’s freezing, Hermes.” The rider expounded, and the motorrad called Hermes replied immediately, “That’s what you get for being so nosy, Kino—what with recklessly coming to this kind of place despite knowing it’s going to be cold.”
“Well, that’s true,” admitted the rider called Kino. The ground that they were running on was jagged with numerous stones, so they rode at a considerably low pace. Hermes continued,
“If after keeping up with these conditions, we find out that there’s no country waiting for us, then there’s ‘no gain for our pains’.”
“… Hmm? You got that right.”
“How rude. —More importantly, if that country’s not there and you don’t get fuel, we won’t have enough to cross this wilderness.”
“I know that. That’s why we’re going on with all our might without dawdling around.”
“Hmph. Well if we did, it’d be a waste of fuel.”
“If I knew that there won’t be enough, I would have turned back to the previous country. I was just considering that right now.”
“That would be troublesome.”
“Anyway, pushing forward is a mark of a ‘professional’ traveler.”
“What’s this about being a professional?” Hermes complained.
“Running properly despite complaints. That’s what it means to be a professional motorrad.”
“Well, that’s true.” Hermes said.


The sun has greatly inclined to the west as the early winter evening neared. All over the wilderness, the shadows of the house-sized boulders scattered about extended towards a single direction.
While Kino was busy stitching a path around the stones, Hermes spoke,
“Isn’t it about time to rest? At this point, it’s no longer possible for us to reach that country within the day.”
“Let’s go on a bit more.”
“That’s the sixth time.”
“… Okay, then let’s do this. If we don’t see anything after climbing that hill in front of us, let’s stop.”
“It’s a deal.”
Kino rode Hermes up the stony hill. Just when they reached its peak and the field of vision beyond was about to reveal itself, Hermes yelled.
“Kino! Stop!”
“Ugh!”
Kino quickly hit the brakes as instructed. The rear wheel locked and slid to the side, sending some sand billowing to the air. A truck appeared suddenly from the side of a boulder just right ahead of Hermes.
“Whoa!”
It came in an abrupt halt in front of the dazed Kino, accompanied with a loud braking sound and a cloud of dust. It was a heavy, off-road truck with at least six tires on its side. When Kino looked up at the elevated driver’s seat, she met the wide-opened gaze of a young man who was gripping the steering wheel.


“I’m really sorry, Kino. If you hadn’t noticed and stopped in time, there would be quite a terrible traffic accident out here in the wilderness. If we collided, I couldn’t guarantee that you two—and our truck, for that matter—would walk off with just a scratch. We would be in quite a mess.”
A man in his fifties apologized. He was thin and tall, and he wore a gray, boa-hooded top coat.
“Please don’t worry about it anymore. Besides, you have already treated me to a meal,” Kino answered. The sun has set and the sky was already dim. She still wore her winter clothes as she sat on a folding chair, a cup of steaming tea in her hands. Behind her, Hermes was parked on his center stand.
In front of Kino was an outdoor barbecue grill, its charcoal embers liberating heat and a faint, red glow. There was meat grilling lusciously on a mesh wire placed on top of it.
Seated opposite Kino was the man along with his wife, a woman roughly the same age wearing similar clothing. Parked behind the couple was the truck they almost collided with.
On top of the high loading platform of the truck were two young men who kept guard with rifles in their hands. One of them was the truck driver.
Both men were the merchant’s sons. The stocks of their rifles were made of green fiber-reinforced plastic with big 20-round magazines inside. They were installed with high-magnification scopes for long-range shooting, not unlike the one Kino used.
“Were you also aiming for that country, Miss Kino?” the man said, turning his head to the right. The hilltop they were sitting on overlooks a plain. A big, dark silhouette could be seen in it. It was the mark of a country; the outline of tall, round walls.
And scattered amidst it were artificial lights that shone like stars.
“That’s right. We heard about a small country in the middle of the wilderness and decided to come. —As for you?”
The man nodded with his teacup on his lips. Hermes asked, “What for?”
“A bit late for introductions eh? We’re merchants from a big country far north from here. We trade as a family, me along with my wife and sons. Normally we go back and forth from our country to neighboring ones, but this time, we decided to try doing business in that country.”
There was a hint of surprise in Kino’s face when she heard the man’s answer. She inquired, “From the previous country I visited, I heard that it was a country that almost no one knows of, and that people rarely come there. But how is it that you knew about it in your country?”
The man shook his head. “Just as you heard, it was really a country in a secluded region. It’s possible that I’m the only one who knows about it in our country.”
“Kino must be upset that there are people other than herself going to that country.”
Kino had no trouble ignoring Hermes’ words, and proceeded to ask some more, “Can you tell me how you learned about it?”
“Sure. It’s really quite simple,” the man answered.
“You see, it’s because I was from that country.”


Kino listened to the man’s story while eating her sumptuous dinner.
The man was born in that country. Of course, he believed that he would spend his entire life in it.
But when he reached the age of twenty, he suddenly had the urge to go out of the country, and couldn’t be swayed otherwise. He fled, not listening to the advice of the people around him.
“So it was a ‘valley of death’?”
“… ‘Folly of youth’?”
“Yes, that’s it!” Hermes said and fell silent. The merchant continued,
“There’s no better way of putting it. It was a really rash thing to do. At that time, it wouldn’t have been strange for me to die a dog’s death in the middle of the wasteland.
“And so I wandered around numerous countries until at last I found one in the north that suited me. I immediately became its citizen. I chose to become a merchant that goes back and forth countries, and worked hard. Eventually I got married and had a family, while my business flourished.
“And when I finally reached this age, I resolved to come back to my home country. —My parents must be long gone, and since I have no siblings, I don’t think there’s anyone left there who knows about me. Still, I wanted to show my countrymen that I have become a ‘professional’ merchant.”
“You don’t mean to give away objects for free to the people in your home country?” Hermes asked, but the man firmly refuted,
“Of course not. I’m a merchant. A merchant’s job is to sell things. I will come back to my birth country as a ‘professional’ merchant. I plan to sell things properly once I get there.”
“You heard him, Kino. Too bad, but it seems you can’t take part of the blessings,” Hermes said, and Kino slightly looked behind at Hermes and gave him a glare.
“If I were human, I would shrug and give you an unrepentant look,” Hermes countered.
Kino looked back at the man, “I just thought I could get something from that country. Do you have fuel? If we can get our hands on some, we plan to cross the wilderness without retracing our steps. If you plan to sell some of your things in that country, we’ll pay.”
“Oh we have. We can sell some of the truck’s spare fuel. In that case, I’ll reserve some for you, Kino. It’s a promise.”
“That would really help.”
“It’s fine. This is also part of business. —But to tell you the truth, I don’t know how much those people are willing to buy when it comes to foreign items.”
In spite of these words, the man spoke in a delighted tone, and Hermes asked. “Really? Then what if they tell you that they don’t need anything? What if they ask you to hand over the items for free?”
“Then I’ll sell the fuel to you and retreat without hesitation. Realizing when things won’t go well, and quickly shifting your focus, is also a mark of a professional merchant. And I won’t give away the items for free, no matter what they tell me.”
“Hmm.”
“But it’s no use to be impatient. We were hurrying so much today, thinking that we can reach the country before sunset. As a result, we get to enter it tomorrow. The same goes for you.”
“I’m looking forward to tomorrow,” Kino said, and the man nodded happily.
“I’m also excited. —Merchants always get nervous the night before entering a country.”
Kino also nodded.
“It’s the same for travelers.”


The next morning, Kino woke up at dawn.
“Ugh—cold.”
Inside her tent, she crawled out of the sleeping bag and put on her winter clothes, winter cap and gloves and went out with the rifle she called ‘Flute’ in her hands.
It was intensely cold and dry. The blue sky was perfectly clear and there were still a number of bright stars left in it. Kino exhaled, letting out a long puff of white air.
When Kino looked at the truck parked nearby, the lone guard sitting on top of the platform wrapped in blankets waved to her.
“Huh?”
Who she thought was the son, was actually the merchant.
Slightly surprised, Kino returned the wave and looked at the other side. At the bottom of the hill was the country, its walls the same color as the ground. Even the closely packed buildings made of stone inside the country shared the same color.
Kino attended to her morning ritual with disinterest. She exercised lightly enough not to break a sweat, and tuned-up Flute. She folded up the tent and wiped her face with a cloth dampened with the water from the water flask that she embraced as she slept.
Kino heated water using solid fuel and carried the cups to the truck. She called out to the merchant, and with Flute on her back, climbed the steps to the platform and handed the cup to the merchant.
“Ah, thanks.”
Kino sat back to back with the merchant and guarded the opposite direction. She put a teabag in her own cup and waited for a while. The merchant took some powdered tea from his pocket and melted it in the hot water. He tasted one or two mouthfuls and drank it with gusto. Steam rose from it.
“I couldn’t sleep, so I exchanged places with my son who was keeping watch. I worked as an assistant for some time when I was still young, so I always kept watch and couldn’t sleep at night. I just remembered the old days,” the merchant said. Kino asked without turning around,
“You’re quite emotional about it after all. Coming home to your birth country, I mean.”
“I don’t get it myself… It was a country I abandoned once. Maybe, I’m actually glad about it? I don’t really understand,” Upon saying so, the merchant let out a slight laugh.
Kino turned around and saw the round walls beyond the merchant’s back.
Soon the sun rose and the merchant’s wife and sons came out from the cabin behind the driver’s seat. All of them ate their breakfast under the clear morning sky. Kino was again treated to a breakfast of boiled vegetables and meat soup.
“You’re the only one having fun, Kino,” Hermes grumbled from behind.
“Eh? —How come you woke up even though nothing’s happened?” Kino asked in surprise.


After their meal, the sun has already risen past the horizon. Light swept the flat land from east to west in a moment.
The traveler and the merchants skillfully packed up their things and piled them in their respective vehicles. Kino parked Hermes beside the truck and stood him up on his side stand.
And just when Kino approached the merchant who was checking the tires at the side of the truck,
A dull rumbling sound echoed in the vicinity, becoming louder as if it was getting closer.
“What’s that? Thunder?” Just as the merchant spoke, the ground suddenly shook. The earth violently moved sideways.
“Whoa!”
“Ah!”
The merchant and Kino crouched down, and the merchant’s wife and sons in the driver’s seat clung to the driving handrails with fearful looks on their faces.
“Whoaaaaaaaaa, it’s shaaaakiiiingggg.” Hermes voice, which had no hint of nervousness at all, quivered in sync with the tremors.
The rumbles and tremors continued for a full ten seconds.
Then it suddenly settled down, as if a switch was turned off. In an instant, the peaceful morning returned.
Kino, still bent down, looked at Hermes.
“Ah, that was a shock,” said Hermes, who, surprisingly, didn’t topple on his side.
As she stood up, Kino looked at the merchant who fell on his back. Both his eyes and his mouth were wide open in shock, and his continuous rough breathing could be heard.
When she turned her gaze to the truck, she saw its passengers frozen with dumbstruck faces. But upon seeing that no one was hurt, she let out a sigh of relief.
“Are you all right?” Kino asked the merchant, whose face was worn out and pale. He shook his head sideways.
“W-what was that just now? What happened?”
“That’s a strong one. About five? Maybe six. But it’s definitely not a seven. That I know.” Hermes said with his usual tone.
“What are you talking about…? What was that…?”
“Uh…,” Kino dithered. Meanwhile, the two sons got down from the truck, carrying their limp mother arm to arm. As soon as they took her to the merchant, the woman who was trembling in fear clung to her husband and began to weep.
“Ah, that was really terrifying—I was scared too. But it’s all right now.” The merchant consoled his wife for a while. Kino waited, saying nothing.
Eventually the wife somehow managed to calm down and stop crying, and her sons carried her again to the truck.
The merchant, who still did not stand up, looked up at Kino and asked,
“What in the world happened? The ground moved! Did a bomb fall? Or maybe a new kind of weapon? Do you know?”
The flustered merchant asked with an utterly serious expression.
“Um…just one question. Are you aware of the term ‘earthquake’?” Kino asked with an uncomfortable look on her face.
“‘Earthquake’? What’s that? A massive lightning of some sort? Did one fall nearby?”
“No, that’s not it,” Kino said, and Hermes began to explain from behind.
“It’s a natural phenomenon. The movement of ground due to volcanic activity or changes in the earth’s crust is referred to as an ‘earthquake’. That’s what just happened. There are various magnitudes, and that one earlier was a strong one.”
“What…? The ground moves? Is something like that even possible?”
“It is. I’ve experienced it many times before. In some places, it happens every year that the residents regard it as a normal occurrence. There were even countries that fixed their furniture to the walls so that they won’t collapse from the shaking.”
“There are also places that almost don’t experience it at all. I’m sure it’s pretty rare for one to occur in this region,” Hermes added.
“The ground moving and shaking…? Impossible. It’s unbelievable, but…for sure…” While muttering, the merchant finally got up to his feet and brushed off the dust on his feet and bottom. And then,
“Ah!” He suddenly gave out a tremendous shout.
“Wah!”
Surprised, Kino drew back and looked at the merchant whose gaze was frozen at a particular point. And then she looked behind her,
“Ah…”
And became speechless. At the area at the bottom of the hill, there should have been a country. But it was no longer there.
“So it was destroyed after all,” Hermes said.
There was only a mountain of rubble. The tall walls collapsed, and what was visible from the interior of the walls were all turned into rubble. The brown dust that was borne from the destruction amassed and flowed leeward.
“The country…”
“…”
The merchant and Kino stood in a row, not moving an inch, and stared at the spectacle. Hermes’ voice reached the two.
“It’s perfectly understandable. It’s a region that hardly experiences earthquakes. Both the walls and the houses were made of stone that were merely put together. They probably don’t even know the term ‘earthquake-proof’.”
“No way…”
The merchant was stupefied with surprise, but Hermes continued with neither diffidence nor mercy, “From the looks of it, almost a hundred percent of the buildings were destroyed. Since it’s early in the morning, everyone must be crushed under their roofs. And in this kind of season, all those people trapped there will be dead in a few days from the cold.”
“…”
The merchant stared mutely at the mountain of rubble.
Kino took a glance at the merchant’s profile, looked for a while in front of her, and exhaled once.
When Kino looked towards the direction of the merchant again, she met glances with the merchant. He had a friendly smile on his face.
“Kino.”
“… What is it?”
“Weren’t you planning to sell some items?”
Kino was taken by surprise with this question for a moment before she answered, “Let’s see…I have a dozen brooches of traditional design from a country in the east.”
“Let me see it.”
As requested, Kino opened the box on the side of Hermes’ rear wheel and took out a small wooden box the size of a book. She opened its lid and showed it to the merchant. Inside it were twelve brooches of detailed craftsmanship, neatly lined up in two rows.
The merchant closed the lid with a snap. “This is nice. You have a good eye for things, Kino. If you give me this, I’ll fill Hermes’ tank and all of those fuel cans. How about it?”
Kino scrutinized the merchant’s smile, and then asked, “Aren’t you going back?”
“No. —Even if I go there, I won’t be able to sell anything.”
“Okay then— I’ll tell you where you can sell those brooches. In exchange, give me a bag of frozen meat.”
“Then it’s a deal.” The merchant offered his right hand.
The two exchanged handshakes, with the mountain of rubble serving as their backdrop.


“May we meet again someday.”
The merchant shouted in a voice loud enough that it wouldn’t lose to the truck’s engine.
Looking up at the truck’s driver seat, Kino shouted back while straddled on Hermes, whose engine was also revved up.
“I’ve mentioned this earlier, but—”
“‘Be careful of ‘aftershocks’ and cracks on the ground.’ I know. Thank you for the tip!”
“Yes. Take care, everyone.”
“Thanks for selling us fuel,” Hermes said.
The merchant waved his hand, blared the horn once, and launched the truck. The sons keeping watch on top of the loading platform also waved their hands as the truck proceeded north.
Hidden under the shade of a boulder, Kino waited until the truck was out of sight.
“Shall we go?”
“Let’s go.”
Kino launched Hermes and climbed down the hill to the west.
They rode slowly upon descending to the flat terrain. Eventually, the mountain of rubble to their right became nearer. They passed right beside it, and soon it was behind them. Kino only spared it a glance.
“Now then—” Kino muttered as she looked ahead.
“For the meantime, you made some profit,” Hermes said.
“I guess so.”
The motorrad continued to run through the arid wilderness.


Amidst the hum of the engine and the relaxed vibration of the suspension.
“Dear,” the merchant’s wife spoke to her husband seated by her side.
“What is it?” The merchant who was gripping the big steering wheel answered without shifting his gaze from the front.
“Those brooches are pretty rare. Miss Kino wasn’t aware that they are worth much more than the fuel and meat she received.”
“Yeah. —I didn’t tell them, of course,” the merchant answered. He released the accelerator, and upon slowing down, turned the wheel to the right.
The truck running through the wilderness slowly turned and headed east.


"
47,v7c2,7,2,"So it was something like that, huh?”
“Yeah. But—”
Kino and Hermes stared at the back of the floating tank.
They stared at the back of the tank until it can no longer be seen; a black tank, with three red vertical lines on the right side of its turret, and a picture of a tapir drawn on the left.


As to how many years or months have passed since then, the tank has already lost count.
The tank roamed, floating over various plains, forests, mountains and deserts. However, no matter where it searched, it couldn’t find the tank ordered to be destroyed by its commander in his final moments.
The tank continued to wander. At times it would get scorched under the intense heat of the sun, or beaten by heavy downpour. At times, it would meet a blast of strong wind or get buried under snow.
To charge itself, it stayed under the sun for countless months. Even if its body corroded all over and many of its parts fell off, it continued its journey.
And there came a time, in a location unknown except for it being a lush forest,
“Commander, I cannot move anymore.”
The tank broke down at last. It could no longer move from its place, it could no longer float. Its enormous body fell on top of a collapsed tree.
“Commander, forgive me. I’m sorry that I couldn’t fulfill your final order. Forgive me. Forgive me.”
The tank said, and no longer thought of anything.


“—This can still move, it’s not yet completely broken.”
“Really? If that’s true, then…amazing!”
The next thoughts of the tank were to wonder as to whom the voices nearby belonged to. To allow a view of the outside, it switched on its sighting device, which was turned off ever since it stopped moving.
The tank watched. Deep in the forest, two children climbed up its body that was buried under fallen leaves. One of them was a boy wearing a hat, and the other one was a girl with pigtails. Both looked around eleven, and wore gray overalls smeared with oil.
As the two children happily brushed away the piled up leaves on top of the tank,
“Who? —Who are you? Who are you two?”
It has been a long time since the tank spoke. The last time it did was ages ago; when it met a motorrad and a traveler.
A quick reply came from the girl and the boy.
“Hello mister tank! Hello!”
“Hello! It’s not completely broken after all—amazing!”
The tank was saddened upon hearing this.
“It’s true that I’m not yet broken. However, I can no longer move. I can no longer move. I can’t do anything,” the tank said, and the children happily replied.
“Then, we will fix you!”
“Fix you!”
Saying nothing else, the children left.
The tank remained silent, and shut its eyes…
And decided that it was nothing but a dream.


But it was an incredible scene that greeted the tank the next time.
Without noticing it, various parts have accumulated around its body. Everywhere, there were parts that the tank needed for it to be fixed.
The boy and girl were working with all their might under the rays of the morning sun. They were changing the tank’s broken parts with the parts that they carried with them. The two used the crane of the small truck that they rode in to move the heavy parts.
“What are you doing? What are you doing?” the tank asked, puzzled.
“Fixing you!”
“Fixing you! Curing you!”
The boy and the girl shouted cheerily. Their faces were smeared with oil, but their smiles were radiant.
“Unbelievable. Unbelievable,” the tank said. But the children proceeded energetically with their work, and by noontime,
“Unbelievable…”
The tank was almost completely fixed. As soon as it is connected to a power generator and received electricity, all of its functions will be restored. Once again, its lifter will be operational, and though it’s not known to how much extent, its big body will be able to float.
“Yippee!”
“Pee!”
The two happily slapped their palms together.
“How were you able to do such a task?” the tank asked.
“Because our master trained us.”
“Trained us!”
The children answered as if it was a trifling matter. According to the two, the reason why they were knowledgeable in fixing broken vehicles was because the two of them worked under a brilliant mechanic, who they called master.
The tank thanked the children. It thanked them with all the words of gratitude it could come up with, that the two were greatly embarrassed.
And then,
“It’s just this—” The girl showed the tank a box. Inside were the completely yellowed bones of a human. In addition, there were tattered clothes, as well as a rusty, unusable hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol). “These belonged to the person inside your body. —We were taught that dead humans should be buried.”
“What are we going to do?” the boy asked. The tank became silent for a while before answering, “Please deal with it according to human customs. Please. Please.”
“Okay,” the two children answered. And then,
“Then, come.”
“Come.”
It was all too sudden that the tank came along without even being given a chance to object.
The tiny truck rattled along on the forest road. It was followed by the tank, floating lowly, and mowing down trees in its path.
Evening was drawing near when they finally came out of the forest and crossed a hill, and arrived at a tiny factory. The factory stood alone in the middle of the meadows, where not a single country could be seen. It was occupied with equipment for repair and cluttered with various machines waiting to be fixed. The factory was surrounded by fields with vegetables growing on them.
The truck stopped by the factory, and the two children trudged along with a box and shovels in tow. The tank slowly followed.
Just when the whole sky was colored with a scarlet hue and the clouds high up in it shone vividly, the tank arrived before a tomb. It was a steel grave marker that stood alone in the middle of the meadow. Beside it, the two children dug a hole and placed the contents of the box inside, laying the tank commander to rest.
Once again, the tank thanked the two children, who had their soiled hands clasped in prayer. Afterwards, the two came home aboard the tank’s turret.


The next morning, the tank asked the children, who were washing their faces by a well, why they were living in such a place.
The two honestly told the tank various things about themselves.
They lived in a country nearby, but were abandoned by their parents since they were little. They were found by their master who lived in an underground tunnel, and were taught how to repair machines. Their master built the factory, and with plenty of abandoned tanks and armored vehicles scattered about due to a war a long time ago, they made a living scavenging parts and repairing vehicles to sell to other countries.
“Are you going to sell me? Is that why you fixed me?” the tank asked in surprise, but the two children shook their heads.
“We won’t sell you.”
“We don’t sell tanks. What we sell to countries are equipment for plowing fields and sowing seeds. So we always remodel the vehicles to serve that purpose. But we can’t remodel a tank that is not yet completely broken.”
“I see,” the tank muttered in relief.
“But just before we met you, our master suddenly caught a cold and died.”
“Died… No matter how many times we shook him, he won’t wake up—”
“That’s why we buried master in the fields he so loved. We thought he felt lonely there all alone, but now, he’s together with that person so he must be happy now, right?”
“Right? Maybe they can become friends.”
The tank asked the two children, “Didn’t you say that your master was a nice person?”
“Yup,” the two answered in unison. Then the tank continued,
“If he is, then I’m sure they can be friends.”


Around noon that day, it began to drizzle.
As the tank can’t be put inside the factory, it settled outside. Being quite heavy, it sank slightly into the soil. But the two children covered its entire body with a sheet.
“You’ll catch a cold if you get wet—”
“Tanks don’t catch colds.”
“Just do it, already,” the boy insisted.


Under the gentle raindrops, the tank rested, covered by a sheet.
“Commander…by some stroke of fortune, I was repaired by two brave children,” the tank muttered.
“But I couldn’t find what I was looking for. I couldn’t find what I was looking for. The tank that you ordered me to destroy…where could it be? Where could it be…?”


Inside the factory, clanking sounds could be heard as the boy and the girl worked.
“Mister tank doesn’t seem well.”
“Yeah, not well.”
“Even after we fixed him, huh?”
“Huh?”
“Let’s cheer him up!”
“Yup. Let’s cheer him— Wait, what does it mean for a tank to be cheerful?”
“Um…when we’re cheerful, what do we do?”
“We do?”
“I know! Being cheerful means to have fun!”
“Yeah, to have fun! And when we have fun we say ‘Yay!’”
“For tanks, that’s the same as shooting the cannon and going ‘Boom!’”
“Yup. That’s it! ‘Boom!’”
“But what are we gonna do? How do we cheer him up?”
“Up?”
“He looks really sad, don’t you think?”
“You think? He was lonely after all.”
“That’s it! Because there are two of us, we weren’t lonely even after master died. So, we should make another tank to be his friend!”
“Oh. Make a friend…”
“I’m sure he’ll be happy.”
“Happy, yeah.”
“If we do that, he’ll go ‘Boom!’”
“He’ll go ‘Boom!’”
The pair jumped up in joy.
“Let’s do it now!”
“Now!”
“If we only do the exterior, it will be done in no time!”
“Time!”
The two abandoned what they were doing, and looked around in the factory for parts that they could use.
They decided to use the iron plates from the rail cars that have been converted to tractors.
And then they made a fake turret using a rain gutter. They painted it black and drew three vertical lines on its right side. And on the left, they drew an animal that looked just like the one drawn on the tank, even though they did not know what it was called.
And it was completed by evening.
“If the weather is clear tomorrow, let’s show it to him!”
“To him!”
The gentle drizzle stopped by dawn.


The boy and the girl removed the sheet covering the tank.
Morning dew sparkled beneath the light of the clear morning.
“I am truly grateful to the two of you. But I have something that I need to do, so I have to leave.”
“Eh? Wait!”
“Wait!”
The two hurriedly returned to the factory.
The tank’s massive form slowly rose. The lifter operated, and with a shudder, the massive armored body floated a mere inches from the ground.
At that moment.
*Vrrrr vrrrr*
From the back of the factory, another tank appeared, digging up mud as it tread over the ground.
“Ah!”
The floating tank raised a cry of surprise.
“I found it…”


Inside the imitation tank running through the ground,
“I’m sure he’ll be happy!”
“Happy!”
The children shouted out in delight.


“Commander, I found it!”
The tank started to move. It advanced at a very slow speed towards the ‘enemy tank’.
“I found it at last. I found it at last! Commander, commend me. Commend me. ‘Make sure to destroy a black tank with three red lines drawn on the right side of the turret, and a tapir drawn on the left.’ I can accomplish that order right here on the land where you rest. I can finally carry out your final command.”
The motor let out a low hum. The heavy turret rotated smoothly, and its 200mm smooth-bore cannon slowly lifted.
“Fire control system check—no problems. Barrel stability mechanism check—no problems.” The tank promptly performed the directions its former commander used to give.
“Enemy tank laser—not exposed. Other enemies—none. First shot—armor piercing round. Next shot—anti-tank projectile.”
The freshly-repaired automatic loading system pushed an enormous depleted uranium shell into the long barrel.
“Loading—complete!”
From the rear of the gun turret, a red lamp lit up. The barrel moved and trained its tip at the sluggish imitation tank, slightly quivering with the movement.
“Alignment—complete!”
And in place of the tank commander, the tank cried out.
“Fire!”













*Vrrrr vrrrr vrrrr vrrrr vrrrr*
The imitation tank came up right in front of the floating tank and stopped.
“Why…”
The tank’s cannon remained silent, but kept its aim at the imitation tank, following its movement.
“Why…why won’t it fire?! Why!”
There was no one to answer the tank’s question.
Soon its large build lost strength and slowly dropped onto the damp earth. The lower half of its body sank into the ground.
“Look, look!”
“Look!”
It was the voice of the boy and the girl, coming from the imitation tank right in front. The hatch made of patched-up iron plates opened, and the two children stuck out their heads.
“Why…why…why…”
It heard nothing. The tank only repeated its question again and again.
“We did it perfectly, right?!”
“Right?!”
The two took out a huge mirror. It was a mirror from a bathroom.
The tank’s sighting device perceived the mirror. The image reflected there was that of the tank half-buried in the earth.
“Why?!”
The tank clearly recognized the figure in the mirror, and came to a realization. Then, as if to avert its eyes away, it vigorously turned its gun turret. At that moment.
Boom!
The moistened gunpowder finally ignited, its thunderous roar shaking the surroundings. The shock wave brushed off all the dew clinging on the grass.
And in a speed five times faster than that of sound, a shell flied out of the cannon and in an instant, leaped beyond the clear sky.


A lone factory stood in the middle of a green meadow.
Right beside it was an enormous tank and a tiny imitation tank.
“Yippee!”
“Amazing!”
And the merry voices of two children echoing for eternity.




"
48,v7c3,7,3,"A lone car was running on a road inside a humid and dense jungle.
However, it was only a road by name, as it was nothing but bare, soppy earth filled with puddles. The thick foliage almost completely blocks the view on either side, and only a portion of the clear sky could be seen amidst the profuse canopy of leaves and branches overhead.
What traversed this path was a tiny, yellow car, so filthy and battered that only a miracle must be keeping it from breaking down. Its rear wheels trudged on, dragging sludge with each turn.
On the right-hand driver’s seat was a young, long-haired woman wearing a white shirt and a bandanna around her neck for wiping away her sweat. One would observe a big revolver holster on her right thigh. With her hands on the slender steering wheel, she drove on with no discernable enthusiasm or boredom in her expression.
Meanwhile, the passenger seat was occupied by a slightly short but 
handsome man wearing a black T-shirt.
“Master…I’m sorry I turned out this way…,” he muttered limply. His face was blue, and beads of sweat formed on his forehead; he looked as if he was about to drop dead at any moment. His seat was slightly inclined, and what served as his pillow was a sleeping bag placed on top of the back seat that was filled with luggage and persuaders (Note: A gun).
“Didn’t you promise not to say that?” the woman called Master replied with a sigh.
“Hahaha… That’s really nice of you, Master,” the man gave out a faint laughter.
“You just shut up and rest,” the woman retorted without looking back at him.
“I’m sorry… It’s my fault that we have to take this detour. If it weren’t for me, we should be on our way to a different country right now…and not in this jungle.”
“Right, I’d prefer that over you whimpering in the passenger seat forever. Besides, if we don’t find out the cause of your condition in the next country, I’m seriously thinking of leaving you behind,” was the woman’s direct answer.
“That’s so cruel…” The man turned to the woman and gave her an imploring look with his ashen face. The woman glanced at him, and with her usual cold tone, “It will be fine as long as we find out.”
“Sigh… What an awkward way to die for someone who survived all sorts of persuader fights with wisdom, skill, and bravery, don’t you think?”
“Indeed,” the woman agreed without a second thought.
“… I won’t be able to rest in peace. You know, maybe my soul will not go to heaven and remain in this car as a gho—” The man stopped his joke as he felt a killing intent emanating from the woman, and just let out another sigh.
“Right now, there’s nothing you can do if that really happens to your body. Just think of something else, something happy.” With this, the woman concluded their dialogue.
“A new rifle on sale… Exceptional accuracy… No loading failures…” The man who was already breaking into cold sweat muttered such things with a blank stare while being lulled by the rocking of the car.


“I can see the walls,” the woman said.
“Minimal explosive force with the most efficiency…,” the man continued, his gaze fixed on the ceiling. “Huh…?”
He looked ahead. Beyond the windshield soiled with the bodies of crushed insects was a gray wall that marked the end of the road. Yonder, the road climbed the gentle slope of a low hill, on top of which was a small country.
“Oh, I’m saved…,” he said in relief. However,
“Something’s wrong,” the woman said as she slowed down the car.
They soon realized what was strange. They were still quite a distance away from country, but the jungle was decimated.
They have come this far without having a clear view from all directions, yet the car suddenly came into a clearing. The trees have all been cut off, and there was nothing but wide, barren earth from there to the walls. And just as the woman stepped on the brakes,
“W-w-w-w-w-w-who are you?!”
The car was surrounded by a group of young soldiers, faces twisted in fear, and rifles trained on them.


“Our apologies, traveler. Their commanding officer accidentally went through a different passage, so those young soldiers have been really impolite to you.”
Inside a wooden building in the country, the woman was seated among several men around a table at the center of a room. It was nearly evening, and the gentle rays of the sun filtered in through the window while a ceiling fan quietly gyrated above them. All of the middle-aged men, who wore thin, short-sleeved shirts patterned with warm earthy colors, had their heads hung low before the woman.
“Let’s put that behind us, Chief. Please don’t worry about it.” The woman addressed the man at the head of the table, and expressed her gratitude for having her companion sent to the hospital.
“Ah, that was nothing.” He continued, “It may be an extreme case of food poisoning. But he would be completely recovered after a few days of rest and intravenous nourishment.”
“That’s good,” the woman replied with no hint of relief or gladness.
“Even so, you couldn’t have come at a worse time.” The chief’s face contorted in grief.
“Say, does that have anything to do with clearing the land on the perimeter of the country?”
“Yes.” The men nodded in unison.
“That doesn’t look like anything other than a rushed construction of a defensive encampment.”
“It’s exactly as you say.” The men exchanged glances, then the chief revealed,
“The day after tomorrow, this country will become a battlefield.”


When the woman asked about their situation, the chief invited her out to the top of the walls, now beautifully flooded by the light of the setting sun. It was overlooking the grounds where the citizens were still hard at work even though it was almost evening.
Twelve days ago, a messenger from a distant land they never heard before arrived in their country. Without so much as a greeting, the messenger proclaimed a one-sided declaration of war: “Fourteen days from now, we will invade this country at the rising of the sun.” He then took his leave without even drinking his tea, and left the citizens in shock and confusion.
The small country became filled with activity. Even though they have an army, they knew nothing about war. They have a few soldiers, but even if the rest of the men were to be mobilized, they could only help with the preparations as there weren’t enough rifles for everybody. They worked desperately, dreading the fate of their women and children if the defenses were breached.
Three days ago, they received a report from their scouts that trucks and carriages carrying roughly a thousand enemy soldiers were approaching from the northern pass. It seemed that they didn’t have tanks or cannons. Upon observing this, they proposed negotiations once the enemy entered their field of vision, but they were ignored. It finally dawned on them that their only choice left was to fight to protect their lives and their country.
Fearing that the country would be infiltrated using the jungle surrounding it, they cleared the forest and built trenches and fences in a hurry. That is when they spotted the shabby car and became suspicious of its passengers.
“That is why it is in your best interests to leave this country right away. If we lose, it will be the end of this country. The men will be killed, and the women and children will most likely be sold off as slaves.”
The woman gazed at the citizens who desperately continued digging holes, and pondered for a while. Then she asked,
“If I were to help you, how much will you pay me?”


“Commanding three hundred soldiers?! Ambushing advancing troops outside the walls?! And three hundred pieces of gold coins as compensation?!”
The one who exclaimed in excitement, as if he had enough strength to jump out of the bed, was no other than the man, now wearing thin blue pajamas and occupying a room inside the hospital. His complexion looked much better, but an intravenous drip still hung from his arm. The view outside the window revealed that it was already evening, but the pounding of hammers beyond the walls was still very much audible.
“You should sleep. —By the way, let me borrow one of your persuaders,” the woman said.
“By all means!” the man said, delight painted all over his face. Then, “How could I miss such an exciting event? I’d prefer to die over there than through food poisoning…”
“You shouldn’t be thinking about death when this country’s citizens are working hard to survive, you know.”
“I’m sorry,” the man apologized then grinned and lowered his voice. “But Master…you volunteered to be in the front lines not only because of the reward, but also because, if by any chance that this country should fall, it will be easier to escape by yourself if you’re outside the walls, am I wrong?”
The woman nodded quickly. “It would be nice if you could move by the day after tomorrow, too.”
“Right…” The man sighed then looked up curiously at the woman. “But!”
“But?”
“We ate the same stuff, but why am I the only one who got sick?”
“Who knows?”


The next day, the female traveler busied herself.
She sported the country’s green combat uniform, with the borrowed 9-mm hand persuader adorning her waist belt. It was a toggle-action type, with eight rounds in one load. Upon gathering her long hair above her nape and wearing the matching cap above it, she looked just like a commanding officer of this country.
First, she directed the work outside the walls, altering it into a more effective base.
Once the whole country was completely surrounded by the fences, she ordered them to construct a wide passageway, around thirty meters across. They made sure that it will be the only entrance to the country, and to make the enemy soldiers concentrate on this passageway, they dug a deep ditch and set traps around the fences.
After this, they narrowed down the middle of the passageway to block the stream of rushing soldiers, and dug multiple layers of trenches from this area up to the walls. This ground and the top of the walls will be lined up with soldiers.
And then, the woman trained the three hundred soldiers under her command.
The only weapons the soldiers had were hand persuaders and rapid-fire automatic rifles that fired ten rounds with one pull of the trigger. There were so few of these that the woman had them prepare persuaders used for hunting, and modified them by cutting short the barrels and stocks. She gave these to the soldiers with muscular builds. Meanwhile, soldiers who were not physically strong but have superb marksmanship, were given rifles with scopes and assigned to the top of the walls to serve as snipers.
Then she divided the soldiers into pairs, and drilled them on various tactics such as covering for a partner who ran out of ammo as well as support protocol for the soldiers retreating to the trenches. It was decided that she would be firing smoke signals to indicate change in strategies, and made everyone memorize by heart the signals corresponding to particular smoke colors.
At first, the soldiers muttered disapprovingly, ‘Do they expect us to obey some outsider woman?’ However, upon observing the woman’s brimming confidence and sound supervision, their doubts turned into motivation, and saw the possibility of survival in following the woman’s orders.
All the while, the man in the hospital whined. “I’m already fine! I’m really okay now, so let me help!”
He would stand up but would stagger and lose strength. The doctors and nurses would then pick him up and return him to bed.
Soon it was evening.
And the coming of the night means the next day will soon begin.


Morning came.
Before sunrise, amidst the morning mist hanging over the jungle, the soldiers embraced their family and friends and set off outside the castle gates with their rifles. Clenching their bullet-filled bags, they entered the trenches together with the partners with whom they will be sharing life or death.
The snipers were prostrate on top of the walls, setting up their rifles and scopes. There were women and children beside them in charge of the spare magazines.
Meanwhile, the woman stood at the front lines together with her hand-picked partner.
The scout came out in a panic from the jungle while shouting the password. He announced that a large troop of enemy soldiers was approaching the country. The tension rose at once.
At last the time has come. The deep red sun rose in the cloudless sky.
“They’re here!” someone shouted. The jungle shook and rustled, and a group of humans appeared. They couldn’t tell how many there are, just the fact that they number more than the soldiers lying in wait with their rifles. Beyond the fences and the passageway, they could see a swarm of people coming out one horde after another.
Amidst the people shivering in anxiety and fear,
“…?”
The woman stood while holding the binoculars in one hand with a bewildered look on her face. She’s not the type who shows her expression, but this time her face conveyed utmost curiosity.
And the reason for this was the scene presented to her by the perfectly circular view of her binoculars—people who by no means could be called soldiers, but ordinary people clad in normal clothes. Their age and gender was diverse. There were men in business suits, boys in school uniforms, old men, and even ten-year-old girls.
All of them had filthy clothes and faces—an indication of their long journey. What they held in their hands were not persuaders or grenades, but primitive weapons like knives, cleavers, and bludgeons. The glint in their eyes was accompanied by their constant rough breathing. It was a rather eerie sight to behold.
“What a shock.” The woman revealed her honest impressions, while the soldiers who were similarly holding binoculars asked what they are to do.
“One way or the other—we’ll have to annihilate them.”
Then the woman took out the persuader for firing signals and selected the appropriate bullet. She fired it into the air, and a purple smoke soared to the sky.
‘Purple? Purple is it?’ The soldiers looked at each other in confusion, for the purple signal meant: ‘The enemy is withdrawing. You don’t have to conceal yourselves. Aim carefully, make sure not to waste bullets and annihilate the enemy completely.’
In reality, the soldiers had no time to contemplate. In the time it took for them to absorb the meaning of the color, the enemy issued out a war cry and began to charge, as if the purple smoke was a signal for them to attack. As expected, they rushed into the fenceless passageway.
Hundreds of them attempted to cross over; hundreds of grimy bodies in a simultaneous assault. The tremors resonated beyond the trenches, reaching even the center of the country.
The next sound heard was the synchronous firing of over a hundred persuaders. The soldiers who warily exposed their faces and rifles from the trenches need not aim carefully—all they needed was to aim straight towards the mob before them, and let the bullets loose.
A spray of blood sprung forth from the fore of the incoming wave of people. The humans collapsed, and the ones behind them tripped and fell over their bodies. A second barrage followed. More people fell, but the rush of humans did not stop. They stepped on the bodies of their fallen comrades and pressed on towards the walls.
The state of affairs soon went to extremes. The enemy continued to charge, flooding into the passageway without a moment’s thought. The soldiers defending it fired again and again, the continuous sounds akin to the hum of the bullets during their practice. Projectiles also rained incessantly from the top of the walls. Corpse piled upon corpse between the jungle and the country, the earth beneath becoming redder with each second.


The scopes of the snipers at the top of the walls reflected the smiling faces of the people plunging into chaos.
“Damn… If you come any closer I’ll shoot…”
Yet they ended up firing their weapons. The humans at the receiving end collapsed with frenzied expressions. The rest paid no mind to the dead all around, and were soon shot down one after the other, their faces as radiant as those who had gone before them.
“W-what the hell… Aren’t they afraid to die…?” A soldier muttered, his face ready to cry.
“Once you start having such thoughts, you’ll lose. Just relax, okay?”
The one who uttered such words stood nearby, wearing blue pajamas and hospital slippers, and hair in utter disarray. It was a slightly short but handsome young man who carried a rifle on his back. A metal stand with an IV drip hanging from it was propped beside him.
Amidst the appalled gazes of the soldiers around him, he sat next to the walls with the needle still pierced in his left arm, and gazed down at the advancing crowd and the soldiers keeping them back with gunfire.
“Now then, how are things around here…?” The man looked from right to left as he muttered. He saw the multitude coming from the morning sun’s direction, rushing earnestly towards the passageway with their crude weapons. No one approached the tall fences. There were also snipers assigned to guard those areas, but they’re yet to fire a single bullet.
“Strange… Are these guys really serious about this war…? Well, makes things easier…”
The man positioned his rifle, moved the bolt and loaded a round. Through the scope, he turned towards a group of smiling boys in their early teens.
“I pray that you keep those happy faces in the afterworld.”
And he squeezed the trigger with neither restraint nor mercy.


Steam rose from the overheated barrels of the rifles.
The soldiers in the dugouts pounded away continuously, pausing only to reload. Before them lay what looked like a carpet made of hundreds of corpses, and the humans who walked over it with smiles on their faces.
From time to time, a few would be able to slip through the storm of bullets and approach the nearest trench. These heroes would be showered with bullets, their bodies turning into honeycombs and their limbs disconnected from their torsos. Just before their death, they would throw their tiny knives that would spin in the air and fall and pierce the damp earth without reaching their mark.
What sounded like high-pitched cheers resonated in the midst of the nonstop gunfire, belonging without doubt to a group of girls in their mid-teens. Around twenty of them lurched in, hands firmly connected with each other. Upon closer inspection, their wrists were tightly bound by strings. They were dirty, but it was plain to see that they wore matching uniforms.
They clambered up the mountain of corpses, staining their feet deep red with the blood of others. They pressed on with smiles on their faces, as if they’re off to meet their loved ones.
“What are you doing! Fire!” A soldier who was in the middle of changing his magazine yelled at his partner. The middle-aged man shook his head.
“No… I have a daughter about their age…”
“They’re enemies! You’ll get killed if you don’t kill them first!”
“T-they’re not carrying any weapons…”
“Fool! What if their bodies were strapped with bombs?!”
The soldier aimed at them as soon as he finished reloading, but a torrent of bullets coming from the top of the walls got to the girls first. Some of them were hit in the head, collapsing as their brains scattered about. The uninjured ones were dragged down because of their linked hands. Yet one of them tried to stand up.
“Die!”
The soldier let out two shots, and the quivering head over her shoulders was soon no more.


“It’s about time to alternate.”
Since the battle, or more precisely, one-sided slaughter began, the woman only stood gazing at its progress through her binoculars. After muttering softly, she fired a red signal.
The red smoke was a signal to swap with the soldiers at the front trench. The soldiers at the back who held fire until then stood up all at once and advanced.
“What does the red smoke mean again? I heard it last night, but I forgot,” the man in pajamas asked.
“The rows will exchange places, so we have to provide covering fire!”
The soldier next to him shouted out. But it was drowned by the intense gunfire.
Under the protective rain of bullets from the walls, the soldiers exhausted from firing retreated to the rear. Some of them showed symptoms of shock, and was pulled down to the ground by their companions.
The new batch of soldiers entered the trenches and began pounding away. The humans that served as their targets were killed one after the other, their bodies stopping and collapsing as they were blown off.
“This is nothing but a massacre!” A young soldier who has just finished providing support fire angrily noted.
“Of course it is, when you’re fighting to win. Well, your other choice is to lose,” the man in pajamas answered quickly, then suddenly acted as if he was in pain. “Ouch…”
“No way! Were you shot?” The soldiers around looked at him anxiously.
“Nope, the needle in my arm got displaced… It’s really painful.” The soldiers’ gazes suddenly turned icy from the man’s answer, and one of them barked,
“… You should go back to the hospital!”


Within the country, the people in the shelters who shivered in fear had no news of the situation outside except for the muffled echoes of the gunshots.
The barrages they thought would continue for eternity eventually died down to a trickle.
And soon, it could no longer be heard.
They looked at each other, seeking explanation in each other’s faces. And then,
“We won!” A young messenger boy hopped in and shouted.
They thought it would last the whole day, but the sun was barely above the horizon, and it was not yet even time for breakfast.


As there is nothing left of our forces, we recognize our defeat.
Only those words were written on a piece of paper.
After the waves of people marching forward with crazy smiles on their faces had vanished, a truce-bearer wearing a proper military uniform came forward waving a white flag and bearing an envelope containing nothing but this paper. Then the truce-bearer skipped away from the dumbfounded chief, just as clueless as everyone else around him.
The eyes of the tired soldiers reflected the glittering, empty magazines bathed by the morning sunlight, and the mountain of corpses already being pecked at by a swarm of flies.
Amidst it, a fair number of people who are yet to die from their fatal wounds stirred about. They merely groaned, their allies having made no effort to save them.
“I’ll take care of things from here.”
The woman fired at their heads, freeing them from their misery. She changed the magazine of her hand persuader and continued to shoot. At the same time, she looked, but found no one who could still be saved.
After all is over, the citizens realized that not a single person was killed from their side. The casualties were: one person who was accidentally shot by friendly fire on his foot; two persons who broke their collarbones from rifle recoil; five soldiers who fainted from shock and fear; and,
One male traveler suffering from stomachache who was dragged back to bed by his fuming doctor.


As the war has come to an end, the cleaning began.
They dug an enormous hole near the country and put inside coal, firewood, fuel, and every single combustible item they could spare. And in this hole, they cremated the corpses. Meanwhile, the carcasses left in the jungle decayed quickly; though not half a day has passed, the bodies torn to bits by bullets were in a cruel state by the time they were recovered.
At first, the soldiers who fought at the front lines were sent to work on the retrieval of bodies, but some of them couldn’t bear the stench and fell sick one after the other, so the women in the country were mobilized in their place.
As they picked up the corpse of a thirty-year old man, fighting the odor with masks,
“These people must have families like us. Maybe they would have wanted to live longer…,” a middle-aged soldier mumbled. At that moment, tears rolled down from his eyes and moistened his mask.
Meanwhile, the female traveler who was still dressed in her military uniform carried on with the task indifferently. She took the corpse from the man’s hands, carried it back to the stretcher by the side, and placed it on top of the corpse of a child.
After sobbing for a while, the soldier turned to the woman,
“If by any chance you get to drop by in this country, please ask them the reason… The reason why this many lives should all go to waste.”
The woman nodded, “But it might be better for us not to know.”
“That may be true…but whatever the reason may be, no country would send its people to such a meaningless death.”
“Whatever the reason may be?”
“Whatever the reason may be.”
“…I’ll hear them out anyway,” the woman said, and returned to work.
On the evening of the next day, they finally finished clearing the surroundings of the country of corpses.
The body count exceeded three thousand.


“I don’t know the reason for that war, but thanks to it, we earned some easy money. What’s more, the hospital expenses were all free. Isn’t it great that we came to that country, Master?”
The complexion of the man has completely returned to normal. He merrily gripped the steering wheel of the small, yellow car. The woman sat composedly on the passenger seat.
Two days have passed since the war. They were given a grand sendoff from the country after the woman received her reward and the man has fully recovered from his condition. They rode through the jungle road under the clear morning sky.
“Now, where shall we go, Master?”
“Please head north.”
“Huh? Is there anything there?”
“No. But let’s head north for now.”
“If that’s what you say.”
And so the man chose north when they arrived at a fork in the road. The car proceeded shakily on the path that was as bad as ever.
That evening, they caught up to a group of carriages. On the narrow road, the empty carriages were connected like a string of beads.
“Master, these guys are…”
“No doubt. I wanted to ask them something.”
Mingled shock and curiosity appeared on the man’s face.
“But—”
“It will be fine.”
The man reluctantly blew the car’s horn and quickly passed each carriage and made it to the front.
Before long, they saw a soldier on horseback at the lead of the line of carriages. It was a man who seemed to be in his fifties. He wore a military uniform and a tall army cap, a persuader holster on his right hip, and a saber on his left. The rest of the people in this group were mostly coachmen, and no one else was dressed in military clothes.
When he saw the travelers, he gave them a refined salute with his right hand. Then he stopped his horse, bringing the queue of carriages to a halt.
“Let’s rest for a while,” the soldier instructed the coachmen and dismounted from his horse. The two alighted from their car, approached the soldier and exchanged customary greetings with him.
The three began to chat while they stood, but after a while, the woman suddenly veered off from small talk.
“By the way, we visited a country a bit south from here—” she started. “It appears that this country was forced into an unexpected war just the other day. They had a hard time it seems, but they were able to repel the enemies somehow.”
“Oh, that was our doing.”
The man, who tried but failed to tell the woman earlier that they might not be told the truth, was truly shocked with the soldier’s blunt reply.
“And so…you are now heading back to your country in those carriages?”
“Indeed. Everybody’s dead after all. —The truck units must have arrived home by now. Horses are really much slower. I myself prefer riding on horseback rather than the jolting of trucks, so I volunteered to command the carriage units.”
Having no interest in the soldier’s personal preferences, the man decided to get straight to the point. “That attack…we heard from the citizens that the soldiers rushed in as if they wanted to get killed. What kind of strategy is that?”
“We don’t have a strategy!” The soldier answered immediately. And with his calm expression, he continued with a candid tone, “That assault was for them to get killed.”
“What?” The man, who thought his ears were deceiving him, asked again.
Without looking offended, the soldier repeated his words. It was an assault for them to get killed.
“That is, in order to have them killed, you declared a war on another country, and because it was in the name of self-defense, they would not feel any guilt over it,” the woman clarified.
“Correct. You’re pretty smart, lady.”
“Uh…, but why?”
“Why, it’s because they wanted to die.” The soldier’s answer was too direct, it made it even harder to comprehend his words.
“And the reason why you intentionally took the people who wanted to die with you is?” the woman asked.
“Ah, that’s because suicide is illegal in our country.”
“Suicide? Then those people…wanted to die? Well, they sure look like it…”
“That’s right. Our country is large in terms of both population and territory. Everyone lives in abundance, and the average life span is long. Yet year after year, many people give up on their lives. It has been a terrible concern. Some of them would leap in front of trains and throw the schedule in disarray. Some would climb buildings and imitate birds, but would end up like crushed toads on the streets. Others would park a borrowed car in their backyards and breathe in the exhaust fumes. There are also those who would drink bottles of sleeping pills, bathe in gasoline and set themselves ablaze, or drown themselves in lakes. In any case, they would always come up with deeds that become a great nuisance to everyone else.”
“I see.”
“O…kay…”
“And so our country took measures to prevent people from committing suicide. We have tried many things.”
“Of course, it’s the end for anyone once they die. Were there any preventive measures that worked?”
“Well that’s right, so we threatened them with rules like: ‘The corpses of those who committed suicide will be made into dog food,’ or ‘If your suicide failed, you will be paraded all over town,’ and so on. There was a time when we added the rule that the family members of a person who commits suicide will be sentenced to life imprisonment, and the suicide rates did drop by five percent then.”
“…”
The man fell silent with a queasy look on his face.
“But nothing worked in the end, so we revoked all of the rules and adopted a final measure. If they wanted to die so much, the country will give them a place to die.”
“Go on.”
“And so we created a new office, the ‘National Suicide Management Center’. We will provide a means for the people who wanted to die, and guide them so that they need not commit acts that will cause inconvenience to others.”
The man had a big question mark drawn on his face. “Huh? Isn’t it because suicide is bad that you wanted to stop them?”
“I didn’t say that. We don’t mind if the people wanted to die, it’s just that their methods are such an annoyance.”
“Oh…”
“So now they can have their intention to commit suicide confirmed in the ‘National Suicide Management Center’, and have their names registered in our ‘Suicide List’. Only then could they participate in our semiannual suicide exercises. Whether they choose to bid their families and friends farewell or not, they would depart to die. Afterwards, we would go to a country far away, proclaim war, and pretend to attack and head to the walls. Everyone would advance forward in earnest. Perhaps it was mass psychology that made it possible for them to face their deaths without fear, don’t you think? After that, the cleanup of the corpses will be done by other people, so we get to relax.”
“I see. I get it now,” the woman answered. Seemingly pleased, the soldier continued,
“But the tough part is choosing a suitable ‘killing country’. Before, we would periodically go to war with a particular country, but eventually they just surrender. So we looked for a different one, but they recognized that it was nothing but a suicidal attempt. All of our candidates became prisoners of war and underwent counseling. It was a big failure in our part. That country just now has been chosen by dice, but it was a huge success. The thing I fear most is for us to ‘win’ the war, but it seems that even though that country had little war potential, they could protect themselves when the right time comes. That was quite some strategy. We’ll probably use that country for several years. I’ll write a report about it once I get home,” the soldier said with a rather satisfied look, and continued. “This method is quite effective. If you go to other countries, well not to countries near this one, please tell them about this magnificent solution to suicide problems.”
“I’ll consider it. —Everything makes sense now. Thank you for telling us.”
“Ah no, it’s my pleasure.”
While the woman and the soldier expressed their gratitude to each other, the man still had a disgruntled look on his face.
“But I don’t understand the feelings of those people who wanted to die… Why, life is so much fun.”
“I don’t understand it either,” the soldier agreed immediately and elaborated, “I don’t understand why they would gladly come to that center. And why they would make such happy faces the moment their applications get approved…” The soldier looked down, the brim of his hat concealing his somewhat melancholic expression. “For me, and for you two as well, we could always use our persuaders if ever we wanted to die. All we have to do is to press it on our temples and pull the trigger. Just one shot, and that’s it. But I won’t do such a thing. There’s a reason to stay alive, to enjoy life.”
“That’s right,” the man agreed while the woman only kept silent.
“If you have a reason to live, you will live. It’s only natural. At the same time, if you don’t have any reason to live, you die. That may also sound natural, but I don’t really understand how there could be no reason. I mean, it’s just like you said earlier, traveler. There are so many fun things to do while you are alive.”
“You bet.”
“But those people have a certain radiance about them. Their faces and eyes. You wouldn’t think those eyes belonged to someone about to die. Once the suicide is approved, they would have this strange happiness about them, even though they came to the center looking no better than a corpse. After a person was told, ‘You will die three months from now,’ it was as if they got released from all of their burden and became refreshed, shouting things like ‘I don’t have to work or study anymore!’ or ‘I’m so glad! I can finally say goodbye to this self!’ During our migration, they would happily talk to each other about death. Not a few of them would say, ‘Watch my beautiful death!’ or ‘Hey soldier, how about joining us?’ Whenever they tell me such things, I get really confounded. I couldn’t understand them at all…
“As you can see, I’m nothing but a lowly soldier. At this age, it would be impossible for me to get promoted, and I wouldn’t become a general even if I die in action. It’s really embarrassing, but my wife left me for a younger man because she thought I have no hope of getting ahead. She won’t even let my children speak my name. Even so, I never once thought of dying. Living is wonderful. But it’s not that life is all fun, as there are painful times too. However, I believe that having a ‘reason for living’ is in itself more rewarding than being alive. So personally, I don’t understand the feelings of those people who choose to die.”
The man became rather pleased with the soldier’s bolstering words. He nodded again and again. “I totally understand,” he agreed. “I was somewhat reluctant to begin my journey, but now it’s my reason for living. I just can’t get enough of it!” he answered animatedly. Meanwhile, the woman remained as expressionless as ever.
Then the man asked. “Mister, mind telling us your reason for living? Is it eating delicious food to your heart’s content? Or maybe immersing yourself in the world of your favorite book?”
The soldier lifted his face, “That is…!” He was a bit embarrassed, but his face was soon filled with delight and answered,
“I love to see the unsightly demise of those suicidal fellows!”


"
49,v7c4,7,4,"A lone car ran in the middle of a wilderness.
This barren land of yellow-brown mountains, sands and stones extended as far as the eye could see. Only the unforgiving glare of the sun could be seen up at the clear blue sky that was completely devoid of clouds.
The solitary thing that made its way through this place while raising a long cloud of dust was a small, filthy, yellow car that looked like it was going to break down at any moment. While its exhaust pipe sputtered black smoke from time to time, it proceeded through the road—if you can call it one—that consisted of small stones mixed with an unknown type of soil. The cracked side mirror looked like it was going to fall off from the car’s jolts.
“Is there really a country at the end of this road? Maybe we were fooled by that traveler, Master?” Asked a rather short but handsome young man on the right-hand driver’s seat. He gripped the narrow steering wheel with both hands, slightly turning it left and right to run the car in a perfectly straight line.
“There is.” The one who returned this curt answer was a young woman with long, black hair who was seated in the passenger’s seat.
Both of them wore pants and white-collared shirts made of light material. Their collars and sleeves were open.
The woman had a pair of sunglasses on, while the man sported a rather tribal look with the cloth tied on his forehead with a string.
“You seem pretty certain about this…but I’d like to know where that confidence is coming from.”
The woman called Master answered the man’s question with extreme confidence,
“Nowhere.”


“But it sure is hot here…Master.”
“You don’t have to point it out,” the woman reproved the man behind the wheels.
As the tiny car rattled on, its form seemed to melt together with the heat’s haze. The sun mercilessly blazed down on the car’s hood, and even the wind blowing in through the window provided no relief.
The man wiped the sweat on his cheeks with the cloth hanging from his head. Meanwhile the sky was reflected on the sunglasses of the woman who remained silent, a serene expression lingering on her face.
“I don’t see a thing… Are we really going to arrive by the end of the day?”
“If not, then we’ll arrive tomorrow. And even if it takes until the day after tomorrow, it’s fine. We should have enough fuel.”
“Well, that’s true…”
The man took a glimpse at the back seat. There were big cans of gasoline lined up haphazardly among their usual travel luggage.


Some hours passed, and soon evening was looming over the wasteland. The sun was almost kissing the western horizon, but it was still hot. Just as before, there was nothing in sight except for sand, stones and bare mountains. The car ran earnestly, a long shadow stretching out on its side.
“Master…let’s take a break,” the driver said, his face beginning to show exhaustion.
“Not yet. Let’s go on until the sun has completely set,” the woman answered.
“And I thought we were not in a hurry…”
“If that traveler was telling the truth…it won’t take too much time now.”
The man turned to the woman in the passenger’s seat. “That’s right…but only if he told us the truth.”
And then the woman returned his gaze, taking off her sunglasses and showing him a rarely-seen smile.
“…W-what?” The man answered, his heart skipping a beat.
“For now, it’s the truth.”
The woman then quickly shifted back her attention to the front of the car. The man followed her gaze.
“Wow…” An awed voice escaped the man’s lips. “There really is one…”
Something green appeared on the view before them. The green lump was slowly emerging underneath the horizon. Upon a closer look, it could be recognized as tree leaves and branches.
However, it was a single tree. The fact that it could be discerned as such from this distance only meant that it was an enormous tree. Both its height and girth were big, and its branches spread like an umbrella.
“‘A tree so big, you wouldn’t believe it unless you see it with your own eyes,’ huh? I’m sorry for not believing you, traveler.” As the man apologized to a person who was not there,
“Now, let’s hurry.”
“Roger!” The man answered the woman’s words with a step on the gas. The engine throbbed and the rear wheels kicked off the ground.
Yet the car did not gain any considerable speed.


The two arrived at the edge of a lake just when the whole expanse of the sky was stained with a madder red hue. The car stopped near the top of a cliff.
From there, they could see the tree in its entirety. To them, it appeared like a gigantic green umbrella.
The tree was located at the heart of a flat island surrounded by walls of stacked stones. A city was visible within it. As the island itself was vast, the eyes might be tricked to perceive the tree to be of a normal size. However, upon seeing the size of the bricks that made up the high walls, one would realize that the tree was indeed of extraordinary proportions.
The lake surrounding the island was like a sea, so wide and boundless that the opposite bank of the lake could not be seen at all. Continuing beyond the curved edges of the horizon, its calm surface reflected the color of the sky and glittered from the light of the sun.
“It’s wonderful, isn’t it?”
“It sure is a magnificent view.”
The two alighted from the car and upon gazing at the scene, became mesmerized for a while.
After some time, the man switched the lights of the car on and off. Soon a small boat came out from the island and headed to their direction.
The two returned to the car and drove until they arrived at a steep slope at the edge of the lake. Over there was a wharf made of quarried stones.
What greeted them there was a small fishing boat carrying around ten people. It must have served its purpose for quite a long time, judging from the patches that covered its body. Two men who seemed to have just gone from fishing came out of the boat.
After an exchange of greetings, the woman requested entry to go sightseeing in their country, mentioning that their visit was because of the rumors about the gigantic tree.
“That’s wonderful! Please, come and see it,” the men readily agreed.
Since it was not possible to bring the car aboard the boat, it was decided that the two should carry their luggage with them. The car was left in a place that almost no one ever visits, but just to be on the safe side, the man set a trap in it; one that makes bullets fly out from every single corner when someone tries to steal it.
The two became passengers of the boat, and were finally able to cross the lake and land on the island. The sun has already set and the stars were already twinkling on the sky when they passed through the gates.
However, it was pitch black; they could barely see anything.
“Since it’s like this, let’s just set aside everything for tomorrow.”
“That’s a good idea. I’m also quite tired.”
The two stayed at a hotel near the gates, and immediately went to sleep.


The next day.
Amidst the dazzling sunlight, the giant tree could be seen well from the windows of the hotel.
In reality, the tree was an hour’s walk away, but it was so big, it’s as if you could reach its branches just by stretching out your hands through the open windows.
“Amazing. There’s no place in this country where that tree is not visible.”
After breakfast, the two spent the morning walking around and sightseeing along with a guide.
The interior of the country shared the same color as the wilderness. The houses and the streets were all built from quarried stones.
Not a shadow of a car could be seen in the narrow road. There were only carriages pulled by burly horses with dusty feet. The country’s interior was covered with fields and animal barns.
“As you can see, our country was built on this island. According to legend, our ancestors who wandered through the wilderness found this lake, island, and tree, and decided to settle here. There was water, protection from the outside, and the gigantic limbs of the tree could block the intense sunlight. It was a wonderful place. I could only imagine their surprise when they first saw it. —By the way, that tree has no name. We simply call it the ‘tree’.”
“Eh? Why is that?” the man asked, surprised.
“That’s because there’s no other tree growing here, right?” the woman walking beside him answered.
“That’s correct,” the guide agreed.
“I see!” The man, visibly impressed, struck his palm with his fist.
“I’m sure you’ve noticed; only short grasses can grow in this arid wasteland. And they take a long time to grow too. It’s really incredible for a tree of that size to flourish in a place like this. It’s a miracle. We can’t even estimate the age of that tree.”
The guide explained as he walked. His tone was gradually getting feverish.
“Because of that, this tree has become the symbol of our country. It is in everyone’s hearts—in everyone’s souls! We have looked up to this tree from the moment of our birth, and we will do so at our death. We hold dear the shadow made by the sole tree that nature has blessed us with in this scorching land.”
“Oh” or “I see” were the only interjections the two made as they walked behind the guide.
“Nature! Bountiful nature and humans! About a hundred years ago, we made the ‘Nature Conservation Law’ to protect this tree at all costs. Protecting it will protect us! The power rooted in the earth fills our daily lives! Our one and only connection! It has been decided by the heavens! It is only natural to feel this way whenever we see the tree!”
The heated speech of the guide now didn’t make any sense to the two travelers.
“Is that so?” or “Amazing” were the only words the man and the woman could say as they continued to follow after the guide.
Soon the three of them arrived near the tree. It was surrounded by high walls so its trunk couldn’t be seen.
Though they are ‘near’ the tree, there was still a considerable distance that separated the walls from the trunk. But at this point, looking up would treat one to a view of the green leaves. The spread-out, umbrella-like branches would remind one of a mountain.
“Wow… It’s really big…,” the man remarked as he looked up.
“But…we can’t go any further.”
The guide had a sorrowful expression, his tone taking on a stark contrast with his animated mood only moments ago. It was more suitable for a funeral greeting.
“These days, the Nature Conservation Act prohibits people from going beyond these walls. We can no longer take our afternoon naps beneath the sunlight that leaks from its branches.”
“Why?” the man asked.
“Because you fear that it would break or collapse, right?” the woman answered once again.
“That’s correct,” the guide nodded.
“Well then, let me show you what’s beyond these walls.”
The guide walked a few steps along the walls and climbed up a set of stairs. The three of them soon came out into a viewing platform at the top of the walls. From there, they should be able to see the trunk of the tree.
“Oh dear,” the man said the moment he saw.
The trunk of the tree was as thick as a skyscraper, connecting the leaves and branches with the ground. But if one looked closely, it was not a single round trunk of a tree. Rather, it was a bunch of numerous trunks fused together.
But having decayed at several spots, it was full of dark holes. There were tens and hundreds of stones put together to support the branches stretched out on its side. While looking at this tragic spectacle,
“How do I put this…it’s injured all over.” The man put his thoughts to words.
“It’s just as you see… The sores in the trunks began to appear several decades ago and haven’t disappeared since. Soon, the frequency of whole branches breaking and falling increased, and now we had to support the branches with pillars. Because of the Nature Conservation Act, as well as for safety reasons, this wall was built and no one was allowed to approach it,” the guide explained miserably.
“If those branches fall, it will be quite terrible,” the man noted.
“Before, there were parks and houses within these walls, that is, under those branches. But a few years ago, a thick branch broke and fell, smashing everything under it. One hundred and twenty five people died.”
“That’s really dreadful.”
“Ever since we discovered those sores, we tried, desperately, to protect the tree in every way possible. However, as matters stand, we could only entrust our luck to heaven.”
“Weren’t there any new sprouts?” the man asked, but the guide only shook his head.
“The tree produces plenty of seeds every year, but all of those that fall die. The seeds couldn’t possibly anchor their roots into this hard soil. We tried planting them near water and even used them as fertilizer. We’ve tried a lot of things but none of them worked.”
“Then how in the world did this tree sprung up…?” The man asked, genuinely puzzled.
“It’s a mystery. And it will be, forever,” the guide answered.
“Does it still produce seeds even now?” the woman asked all of a sudden. The surprised guide nodded as he answered the query.
“Eh? Yes. There are still seeds this year.”
“Then it will be fine,” The woman said, but did not elaborate further on her meaning. The guide only tilted his head.
“You have shown us something very wonderful. Please continue to take care of this tree,” the woman said.
“Why, of course!” The guide nodded firmly.


The black-haired woman and her partner spent about two days in the country.
While the man lowered his bait into the lake to catch some dinner, the woman spent her time leisurely, reading and doing other things. From time to time they would lift their eyes and see the ever-present tree.
On the morning of the third day, underneath the clear sky, the pair once again rode the rocky boat and returned to site of their car, which was safe and the same as they had left it. The man removed the trap that he set up.
The two expressed their gratitude and parted with the country’s citizens. The small, decrepit car climbed up the hill road and went up again to the cliff where the country could be viewed.
“It’s such a wonderful view, isn’t it?” The man alighted from the car and gazed at the lake, island and tree.
The woman also got off from the car and silently looked at the scenery.
The man and the woman remained standing for a while amidst the morning wind blowing through the wilderness; the enormous tree visible beyond the car flanked in between them.
Eventually, the man broke the silence.
“Master.”
“What is it?”
“That tree will collapse, won’t it?”
“In half a year, most likely.” The woman promptly answered the man’s question in an extremely casual tone. “Just as that traveler said, eventually, even this view will no longer be seen.”
“It’s a pity,” the man said, sincerely regretful.
“But—” the woman began, and the man turned towards her.
“Sprouts will grow out from the collapsed tree.”
“Eh? What do you mean?”
“That tree will fall and eventually decay from the wind and rain, but the sprouts will have a soft spot to grow in, and plenty of nourishment. It will become a perfect seedbed.”
“Ah! I see!”
“It is likely that that tree grow up in that manner as well. The trunks of the trees eventually fused together and formed one, gigantic tree. I don’t know how many hundreds or thousands of years it took, but before long, this cycle will start again.”
“Then it’s fine even if it collapses. The people of that country should just take good care of the tree sprouts. Eventually, the interior of that enclosure will become full of greenery!” The man said with a delighted tone, and the woman nodded.
“But then, maybe that’s something that both of us wouldn’t be able to see.”














“But then, maybe that’s something that I wouldn’t be able to see.”
“I want to see it! The place where fresh buds are springing from! Someday, I will!”
To the words of an old woman, a little girl exclaimed, her eyes glittering with excitement.


“Do you remember this story, Hermes? At that time, were you…asleep? Or were you left outside?”
A lone motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) rode through the wilderness. It was a motorrad loaded with traveling luggage and fuel cans on top of its rear wheel.
“I don’t remember, Kino,” the motorrad called Hermes answered his rider.
The rider called Kino was clad in a brown coat, the excess hem of which was rolled up to her thighs. She wore a brimmed hat with ear flaps, and goggles over her eyes. A bandana to keep out the dust was wrapped around her face.
The motorrad ran beneath the clear noon sky.
“That’s why I was so happy when I realized that we’re near this country.”
“Uh-huh.” Then Hermes followed-up his short response, “But there’s no doubt that we can no longer see that big tree, right?”
Kino nodded. “But that’s okay. What I wanted to see is the scenery that Master and her student weren’t able to see.”
“And by deliberately visiting this kind of place, you’re just showing how extremely curious you are, Kino.”
“And I chose to come here during the winter. Because of that, we wouldn’t have to suffer under the scorching sun like the time they came here.”
“Except, we only rode here after you learned by chance that this country will be nearby. In short, you’re acting on blindsight.”
“… Acting on hindsight?”
“Yeah, that!” Hermes said and fell silent.
“But guess what, I bought a bag of flower seeds in the previous country.”
“Oh, I didn’t notice.”
“I chose the aquatic type, the kind that blooms while afloat on water. I will offer it to this country’s residents. I thought they’d be delighted if they could grow flowers in water tanks beside the trees.”
“You’ll give it to them? That’s rare of you, Kino.”
“I’ll sell them.”
“Oh. But, you won’t be there to see the trees surrounded by those flowers.”
“That’s okay.”
“Hmm.”


The morning of the next day. Kino and Hermes arrived at a cliff overlooking a lake.
There was the endless expanse of a lake and a single, enormous island.
“It’s just as Master said…”
“But what’s up with that dome?”
Just as Hermes remarked, at the center of the island, that is, at the heart of the country, there was a big dome made of stone.
“I wonder…? The tree should be right there…so maybe they made it into a botanical garden or something?”
“We’ll know once we get there. —Wait, don’t leave me behind, okay?”
Kino switched Hermes’ headlights on and off, sending a signal. Soon a small boat came out from the island and headed to their direction.


After taking Hermes on board using a plank, they proceeded to cross the lake.
Upon being handed an entry permit, she rode towards the country. While she unloaded the luggage in her hotel room, she noticed how the dome could be seen very well even from their window.
Kino rode Hermes to the country center. While running through the streets made of stone, the huge dome gradually became higher and higher in view as they neared it.
“Welcome, traveler.”
The guide received Kino and Hermes in a plaza right in front of the dome. Kino dismounted Hermes and looked up at it. It was a pretty impressive structure, made of numerous stones put together with very little gap between them. Tiny skylights can also be seen all over it.
“It’s so big.” Kino voiced her impression.
“Yes! It is our country’s pride!” the guide answered delightedly.
“Can you show us what’s inside?” Hermes asked.
“Of course! It’s our country’s pride! Symbol! Heart and Soul! Spirit! —Over here, please see for yourselves.”
Following the guide, Kino pushed Hermes and passed through the dome’s huge doors.
Using a tiny lamp, they passed the dark corridor and climbed a slightly elevated slope. The guide helped in pushing Hermes up.
The place where the two humans and vehicle arrived at was the viewing platform inside the dome. They could see the expanse of the dome’s interior, but they could not make out what’s in it because of the darkness.
The guide sounded a bell beside him several times. Its gloomy peals resounded inside the dome.
Soon the interior of the dome became brighter. The blinds of the skylights opened one after another, letting thin strips of light shine in.
“Behold!” the guide exclaimed with pride.
“…”
“…”
Kino and Hermes gazed in mute amazement, for what appeared before them was…
A collapsed tree. The thick tree scattered its leaves and branches in all directions. However there was nothing green to see. All there was were trunks and branches gray from dryness. They looked like huge, gray snakes wriggling on top of the brown stones.
“… What…is this?” Kino asked.
“Our country’s soul!” the guide answered.
“I know that already, but what exactly is this?”
“Oh. This is a tree that once grew on this place. As there are no other trees in this country, we refer to it simply as the ‘tree’. It’s a very big tree, as you can see. When it still stood, it was even higher than this dome.” The guide explained without hesitation.
“But why is it like this?” Hermes asked.
“Of course! I’ll explain it to you! —It was many decades ago when the tree our ancestors found on this land where they have settled have collapsed after its long life has come to an end. It made us really sad, but we have to protect the tree as decreed by our Nature Conservation Act. So we decided to continue protecting the tree forever!”
“…”
“Uh-huh. And then?”
“We covered the tree with this dome—to protect it against the harsh rays of the sun and wind and rain! It was a very difficult construction project, but it was completed magnificently. With this, no matter how many years pass, the tree will remain as it is, just how it looks now!”
“…”
“I see.”
“Of course, we deeply regret that the life of the tree has come to an end. However, we are glad that we can forever preserve the proof of its existence! No matter how many generations pass, this tree will remain as our symbol for eternity!” The guide spread his arms wide and finished his speech.
Then upon seeing the convoluted expression on Kino’s face, asked hesitantly,
“Is anything the matter, traveler?”


The morning of the third day.
“That’s one hell of a country…”
Kino let out a sigh after they bid farewell the boat that transported them back to shore.
“Wasn’t that interesting! For a dome of that size to be constructed using stones without a single pillar, it needed immense architectural skill. It was really impressive! I’m glad we came.”
“Uh-huh,” Kino threw Hermes a sidelong glance, then straightened her hat.
“Kino, what about the seeds?” Hermes asked as Kino straddled him.
“Oh, these…” Kino opened the front of her coat and took out a small paper bag from her jacket’s pocket.
She tore open the bag, and let a number of small seeds roll into her gloved palm.
“I have no need for these anymore…” Kino clenched her hands and glanced at the surface of the lake.
“Oh, you’re going to throw them in the lake?”
“I don’t know if the flowers will bloom, though.”
“But there’s no harm in trying.”
“Well then—” Kino raised her arms.
“There!”
She threw them with all her strength towards the lake. They scattered, drawing invisible arcs in the air, before dropping and creating ripples on the water’s surface.
Soon after, the surface of the water rippled violently.
A group of fish ate all of the seeds.














"
50,v7c5,7,5,"The spring meadow was bursting with color.
The ground was multicolored from many different kinds of flowers blooming at the same time; it was as if a rainbow descended from the sky and glued itself on the ground. The bed of flowers stretched out beyond the horizon was being illuminated by the gentle rays of the noon sun. A single hue dominated one area were flowers of the same color were grouped together, while in another place, a diverse range of flower colors were mixed together, giving birth to an entirely new hue.
A motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) was running slowly on a single road dividing the flower meadow. It leisurely rode through the damp, dark brown road, the sound coming from its exhaust held back.
It was a luggage-laden motorrad. Boxes were attached on both sides of its back seat, and there was a bag on top of the carrier.
Its rider was wearing a brown coat, the collar of which was opened to allow the warm air in. Its long, excess hem was wrapped up to her thighs. She was wearing a brimmed hat with flaps covering the ears, and strapped around it was a pair of silver-framed goggles that was already peeled off in places. She was around her mid-teens, with short, black hair and a fearless expression on her face.
“It’s such a beautiful place. Really,” the rider shared her impressions with a cheerful tone while riding the motorrad.
“I agree. This is a nice place,” answered the motorrad.
“Spring is so great, isn’t it? Mornings and evenings are still cold, but when riding in the daytime, the coolness of the air doesn’t freeze you over. It’s really painful when your fingers are freezing. When it’s warm, I can ride absentmindedly.”
“Hmm. Well, how many springs have you seen Kino? Fifteen? Thirty? Or maybe, 300?”
The rider called Kino answered with a laugh, “Was it that long already? I’ve already forgotten. What about you, Hermes?”
“I don’t remember,” the motorrad called Hermes replied jokingly.
“I guessed as much,” Kino replied with a look of comprehension.
“Hmm? Why?”
“Well, Hermes— Ah, I see it.”
Underneath the horizon ahead of them, the gray-colored walls slowly came into view from the middle of the flower fields.
“Say, that country must be wonderful to suit a place as wonderful as this. I wonder if it’s a good country?”
“What is a ‘good country’ to you, Kino?” Hermes asked, paying no heed to the change in topic.
Kino answered immediately, “The food is delicious and cheap. Inns with showers are cheap. —And if possible, both are free.”
“Something like that out of the blue…”
“What about you, Hermes?”
“Fuel, parts, and service costs are cheap. And if possible, entirely free!”
“I knew it. —But it’s not like we can come across such a convenient country so easily… Well, it’s fine as long as it doesn’t overcharge.”
“I guess so. More than that, pray that there’s a skilled mechanic over there.”
“Now then, what kind of country will it be like?”
“I’m looking forward to it,” Hermes said.
Kino nodded. “Me too.”
And then she accelerated.


“—How much the food is? Well, since you’re a traveler, we can’t accept any money from you. In the first place, all basic food necessities are distributed in this country.”
“—Price of the fuel? Everything’s being distributed, you see. If we receive any money, we’ll get an earful from our boss.”
“—Payment for motorrad service? It’s not like there’s no fee, but since the technology is so advanced in this country, basic fine-tuning is as easy as changing a light bulb.”
“—The cost for this inn? Traveler, you are a guest so we can’t take any money from you. Please enjoy your stay. It’s just for three days, but to tell you the truth, it doesn’t make any difference whether you stay for one or two months.”
“—Replenishing your travel supplies? If there’s anything you need, just grab anything you want. No need to hold back.”


The evening of the second day since they entered the country.
“What a great place!”
“What a great place!”
Kino and Hermes mused while in the park at the country center.
Tied with a rubber string on Hermes’ carrier was a box of goods Kino was able to get for free. The box contained portable rations, persuader (Note: A gun) bullets, liquid gunpowder, and a bag of new underwear.
The black-jacketed Kino was sitting on a bench beside Hermes. A revolver-type hand persuader was suspended from her right thigh. A vivid flower field, similar to the ones outside the country, could be seen inside the spacious park.
“Kino, what they call ‘heaven’ should be a place like this. I’m sure of it.”
“Then that means the people here are heaven dwellers even though they’re still alive…? Indeed, everyone have bright faces, as if they live their lives in happiness from the bottom of their hearts… It’s the first time I’ve seen such a country.”
“Isn’t that great?”
“Yeah, but if that’s the case—”
“Yeah?”
“If the people in this place die, where do they go?”
Hermes replied coldly to Kino’s question. “Who knows? Anyway, do you really believe that there is such a thing as heaven, Kino?”
“…”
Kino fell silent. And then, a warm wind blew and shook her hair. Amidst this warm and snug atmosphere, Kino replied, “Well, it doesn’t really matter.”
“I guess so.”


After a while,
“In the restaurant we’re in earlier, I asked a person why this country can afford to be so generous—” Kino started.
“Oh, and?”
“It was because they’re rich. Be it grains, meat, or fish, this country was abundant with food resources, so there’s no way the citizens would starve. Moreover, the progress in technology and medicine are used for the happiness of the people. Besides that, they strictly regulate their population so that it wouldn’t increase any more than necessary, so it seems like they can continue living in abundance and peace for several hundred years more,” Kino said in a yearning tone, with a hint of jealousy, while leaning on the back seat of a bench and looking up at the sky.
“This place is heaven, no doubt.”
“Sure is…,” Kino muttered, shut her eyes and fell silent.
Hermes suddenly spoke dramatically, “‘And with that, lazybones Kino couldn’t find it in herself to leave this laid-back country. Therefore, Kino’s journey ends here. And she lived happily ever after—’”
Kino opened her eyes and lowered her face. “Don’t decide just like that, Hermes. I have no intention to stop just yet.”
“But you know Kino, if you stay here, you’ll never have to go hungry until you die.”
In reply to Hermes’ words, Kino muttered with a serious expression, “You have a point… And so I’ll dispose of the useless Hermes, and borrow a small room…”
“‘—was what I thought, but Kino did not end her journey. To be continued!’”


The next day, the morning of the third day since they entered the country. Kino woke up at dawn as usual.
While being bathed by the morning glow flowing in through the wide windows, Kino practiced her quick draw with the revolver she called ‘Canon’. Afterwards, she did a thorough maintenance, inserted bullets inside, then returned it to her holster.
Kino spent a long time in the shower, as if she was reluctant to part with it, and then ate the large serving of breakfast carried to her room.
Kino laid out her luggage on top of the room’s carpet, checking in detail the number and condition of each item. Then she let out words of thanks to her old underwear, and left them outside the bag after folding them up carefully.
After she has loaded the bag on Hermes and firmly fixed it up with strings,
“Now then…,” Kino muttered words with hidden determination and took one big breath. And then,
“Wake up!”
While yelling, Kino pounded on Hermes’ seat with both fists.
She pounded.
And pounded for a while.
And pounded stronger.


“Aren’t we leaving yet? It’s already the third day.”
“Let’s leave at the last minute.”
“Whatever.”
“It’s heaven, after all.”
“Whatever.”
The jacket-clad Kino and the luggage-laden Hermes were in the same park as the previous day. It turned into a café, with chairs and tables lined up on the stone paving right beneath the blue sky. It was past lunch so there were only a few people. Kino was sitting at the last row of tables. On top of the table was a pot of green tea, a cup, and a finished plate of dessert. Hermes stood on his center stand opposite her.
A young waiter pushing a rubber-tired wagon approached. He asked if Kino wanted a second cup of tea.
“Kino, aren’t we leaving yet?”
“I’ll have one more cup.” As Kino requested, the pot was immediately replaced with a new one. Kino poured some into her cup. Steam and aroma arose from it.
“Jeez, why don’t you live in this country forever then?”
Just when Hermes said this with an annoyed tone, a man sat on the table to their right. It was a thin man who seemed to be in his forties. He was neither wearing office nor work clothes. He was only wearing simple slacks and a long-sleeved shirt.
“…”
Kino looked at the man. The man’s cheeks were gaunt, and the corners of his eyes were wrinkled—they carried extreme exhaustion. It was not like he was tired just now; it was as if his lethargy lasted day in and day out, weariness solidified on his face.
The man glanced at Kino and Hermes. The moment he was about to say something, the waiter approached, so he requested tea.
When the waiter left,
“Hello.” Kino bowed in greeting.
“Ah, great weather, isn’t it? —A traveler, huh? That’s nice,” the man answered with a calm voice, indifferently, with no hint of unpleasantness.
“I am Kino. This here is my partner Hermes. We stayed in this country since the day before last. I’ll be leaving today, though this is a very nice country,” Kino said.
The man carried the tea cup to his lips. “Isn’t it,” he answered without any change in his tone. “This country is a great place for everyone, except for me. —Yeah, it is such a wonderful country. —No doubt about it.”
“Except for you?”
“What do you mean?” Hermes asked.
The man answered with the same expression and tone as before, “I am not supposed to say this to anyone…but if it’s to a traveler who is leaving today, I suppose it won’t hurt.” Then he continued,
“You see, I don’t die.”


The blue sky, the greenery and the flowers blooming in profusion in the park.
While looking at these, the two people seated at the end of the café exchanged words.
“Did you just say ‘I don’t die’?”
“Yeah. —I don’t die.”
“Then that means you have lived for many years already?”
“No. —That’s not quite right. The me here right now is not yet 28 years old.”
“… Then, how?”
Before answering Kino’s question, the man quickly drained his cup of tea.
“Through continuation of memories. —My memories are being carried on.”
“What was that again?” Hermes asked.
“There are memories from a long, long time ago inside me. —Memories before I was born. —Memories of other people who lived here before. —Memories before that. —And memories before that. —And before that. —And before that. Off the top of my head, I have memories of five humans. Basically, it’s nothing but several lifetimes continuing on end.”
“That’s a bit… Well, this may be rude, but is that for real? Maybe you’re mistaken, or confused…,” Kino asked while looking at the man. The man answered, gaze still straight ahead.
“Four generations ago— I was twenty years old at the time, and like you, I thought that the memories of another lifetime that appeared inside my head were only hallucinations or delusions. That’s what I believed. And so, out of the desire to clarify things, I investigated. Eventually, I found records.”
“…”
“That ‘me’ certainly existed. It was a man who died in an accident when I was just five years old. That man’s wife was still alive, and I met with her. —I remember everything so well; things that I’m not supposed to know. The wife’s hobbies, way of talking, and so on—I guessed them all correctly, it was so creepy. —Even though I loved her, she told me to stay away from her. Even though it has been close to a hundred years since then, I could still clearly remember it. —The memories of the generation before that have become rather blurry though.”
“What did you do after that?”
“After that— I lived that life. Eventually, I got married, and died from an illness at around fifty, if I remember correctly. The next is another man’s— and as expected I had memories from when I was five. I tried to tell my parents about the things that I recall, but they wouldn’t let me. Eventually, they got angry, so I gave up trying to tell them. The parents from that lifetime— Well except for that, they’re kind.”
“What happened after that?”
“That life also came to an end. If I’m not mistaken, when I was around thirty, I drowned in a lake. The next one is another man’s life. I got married, had children, and lived long enough to see my grandchildren. The next one was the life before this one. And now—”
“…”
“…”
“It doesn’t really matter whether you believe it or not.”
“I don’t know whether that story is possible or not, but I can’t think of any reason why you would lie to us here now.”
“You’re an interesting one, traveler,” the man said without smiling, and then, “It’s been quite a long time since I last met a traveler—”
“Hmm…you mean your previous lifetimes? What kind of traveler did you meet?”
The man pondered over Hermes’ question for a while with a countenance as inexpressive as ever.
“The ones I met before…as to which me it was, I don’t remember, and I have already forgotten…was a man and a woman riding a small, battered, yellow car. I say meet—but I was actually only a child back then, so I only remembered the woman alighting from the car, asking me for directions. The woman thanked me graciously. It was a long-haired woman. Ah! She was wearing a revolver similar to the one on your hip, traveler. No, it was exactly the same type. I could clearly remember it, because it was on my eye level.”
“… Those people, how did they behave in this country?”
“Ah. Afterwards those two—since everything was free—ate until we thought their bellies would burst, and took everything they could get until the tires of their car almost broke, then left. It became news. That greed became the talk of the town for a while. I also had that impression about those two.”
“…”
Kino kept silent, while Hermes asked, “Well let’s get back on topic. If that story of ‘not dying’ is the real deal, isn’t that amazing?”
“I thought so too, a long, long time ago— I became conceited with thoughts that I’m special, or close to being a God. I thought it was so wonderful to get to live in this laid-back country for eternity.”
“Really?”
“Yeah. To live a person’s life, to remember about different people. In my next life, nobody would know me. To do everything again from the beginning. To repeat everything again. But about two generations ago, I already began to despise it all. I’m already tired of it. I’m already sick of it. I’m so tired—”
The man took the pot and poured tea into the cup without looking. He continued to pour blindly, and returned the pot when the cup was exactly eighty percent full.
“I’ve had enough. I don’t want to do anything anymore. Living endlessly. Having new memories— Whether it be good or bad, I’m already tired. It’s depressing.”
“Depressing…?”
“Yes. It’s as if the memories are attacking me. It’s like being surrounded and beaten with sticks all at once. —But even if I commit suicide it will still be the same. I don’t want the painful memories because even those would remain. To pass time doing the lowest work without doing any thinking; to do the same thing every day and prevent making special memories—during my previous life, I started living with these thoughts in mind. I want to stop but I can’t. It’s like a wheel running continuously. I wondered many times over whether this isn’t hell. I even thought, I might as well go insane, maybe then I would be at peace. But I am scared. What if my memories from being mad remained? Such a thing—I definitely don’t want them to get carried on.”
“…”
“And so I won’t make memories. I’ll live each day in the same way, and forget each day. I’ll do my best to forget.”
“Eh, then isn’t today a bad thing then?” Hermes asked with neither restraint nor mercy. Then the man drank his tea in one gulp. He stood up aimlessly, slowly turned his head, and looked down at Kino and Hermes.
“Who are you?”
The man only muttered these words with eyes that seemed to have awakened, and walked away.


“For some people, even heaven can be tough, huh.”
Hermes spoke when the man disappeared. And then,
“Master’s story was true after all. I was surprised.”
“…”
While the still silent Kino drank her cold tea,
“Miss traveler, did that man tell you anything?” The waiter who came to tidy up the man’s portion asked her with a worried look on his face.
“When we mentioned how much we liked this country, that person said that he didn’t agree,” Kino said, and the waiter displayed a look of relief.
“That guy always sits in that place at this time of the day, but he doesn’t say much, so it was a little strange for him to do that today. —It’s fine as long as he didn’t give you any disturbing thoughts.”
“What kind of person is he?” Hermes asked.
“Who knows? He almost doesn’t talk to other people, so I have no idea.” The waiter shrugged. And then,
When I noticed that he was talking to you, I was really surprised. I won’t forget that for a while.”


“That’s for dinner.”
“Like teacher, like student.”
Night was already approaching when Kino, who was in front of the gates, hung big cloth bags containing free stuff she obtained on Hermes’ handlebars. Inside were meat for steaks from the butcher, and fruits she got from the fruit seller.
“The next time we come to this country, let’s have a sidecar attached to you, Hermes.”
“Stop it.”
After bowing to the immigration inspector who went to see them off, Kino passed through the gates while pushing Hermes along. After passing through the tunnel-like gate, and when she has taken a step into the flower fields outside the country,
“Traveler!”
They were called out with a loud voice. Kino looked around, and faced six men. They have different ages, but everyone was wearing white robes.
“We apologize for the intrusion, but we only wanted to talk to you for a bit. It won’t take much of your time,” said a middle-aged man who seemed to be the oldest among them.
Kino put down Hermes’ side stand. The men standing in front of Kino bowed lightly, and the man before continued,
“Miss traveler, in the morning, while you were in the café at the central park, you were spoken to by a man, right?”
“Yes.”
“Yup.”
“To be honest, we are doctors from this country, and that man is under our care. We would like you to tell us what kind of things he told a traveler who doesn’t belong to this country.”
“…”
Kino contemplated for a moment before answering, “Um, that person told me a pretty weird story about his personal history. —That he had memories of other people in the past, generation after generation. That is, that he doesn’t die.”
The men in white robes were evidently shocked with Kino’s words. One of them eagerly ran his pen on a thick file that he was holding.
“T-that time, how did he appear while saying that? Did he say that calmly? Or does it look as if he was lying?”
“If I were to choose between the two, it was calmly.”
“Was he sweating or stammering in particular?”
“Not at all,” Hermes answered. Kino also shook her head sideways.
“It doesn’t seem to me like he was lying. But his story was really outrageous.”
“I see…”
And then the men talked to each other about something in low voices, nodding and shaking their heads from time to time.
“What do you think?” Hermes talked in a small voice so that only Kino would hear.
“I would like to know what they’re talking about… But it doesn’t look like they’re going to tell us.”
“Boring, isn’t it?”
“Boring alright,” Kino returned. She reflected for a bit, and murmured, “Since we don’t have anything to lose, let’s try trapping them into answering our questions…”
“Oh, I agree. That’s mean considering it’s you, Kino.”
“I would like to know the truth if it is within my ability.”
And then Kino talked to the men who were in the middle of their discussion.
“By the way—”
The men in white robes who seemed to have forgotten about Kino turned around. And then the middle-aged man spoke, “Ah, I’m sorry. It took quite some time. —Thank you very much. You were a big help.”
“There’s one thing I would like to ask, though…”
“Huh? What is it?”
“This country is such a great place to live in. I actually thought it a pity that I have to leave,” Kino said.
“That’s right!” Hermes agreed from behind.
“We’re happy to hear that.”
And then, Kino questioned the men who had broad smiles in their faces. “It strikes me as odd how a neurotic person like that appeared in such a wonderful country. Maybe no country is perfect, after all?”
The men’s smiles twitched.
“Yeah! Something’s terribly wrong. You guys are psychiatrists, aren’t you? Why did that guy become like that? The environment must have something to do with it.” Hermes said. A young man looked obviously offended with his words. The elderly man put his hands on his shoulder to pacify his anger.
“Traveler. This is a rather big misunderstanding. I believe you have seen how wonderful our country is with your own eyes.”
“Yes, indeed. That’s why I’m interested to know what could have possibly happened in this wonderful country for that man to go insane. As doctors, you probably won’t be too happy with it, but if you can, please tell me,” Kino stated her request frankly.
“Ah, but Kino, these guys don’t know a thing, that’s why they’re asking us about it, right? Then it’s no good,” Hermes said, being deliberately rude.
The young man who was on the verge of exploding was held back, and the middle-aged man walked to Kino and Hermes. He was wearing a rather stern expression, and began to speak with a rising tempo.
“It would be really troublesome to us if you, who don’t even know the truth, start spreading bad rumors about our country. Please believe me when I say that there is not a single person in our country who has fallen mentally ill.”
“I understand that. But we are truly surprised to meet someone who would tell us such things, and to top it off, doctors are examining this person…”
The middle-aged man gave a big nod.
“Fine then. As matters stand, we will definitely be misunderstood. We can tell you the truth…”
The men behind were stunned at these words, but he restrained their protests with one hand,
“But, you can never step inside our country a second time. Will that be okay?”


Kino deliberated for some time while being pestered by Hermes. And after she agreed with the condition, the middle-aged man told her at last,
“Fine, then I will tell you everything.”
The other white-robed men at the back said nothing, and only observed the course of events. The sun has inclined greatly to the west, shining inside the castle gates. The white robes of the men were dyed a light orange.
“Everything that man said was the truth.”
“…”
“What in the world?!”
Kino remained wordless while Hermes let out an exaggerated exclamation of surprise.
“Inside that man, there are memories beyond his generation. These are ‘true facts’. These are absolutely not assumptions or delusions. And also— You already know don’t you?”
“That you doctors carried it out…”
“That’s right. A long time ago, our ancestors successfully performed an experiment: immediately after death, they took out that person’s memories and transplanted them into another person. This was a system created to tackle the idea of eternal life, which everyone yearned for at least once in their lives.”
“Wait a minute. Even though that person inherits memories, it doesn’t change the fact that he dies, right? Having one or two people carry the same memories is not the same as ‘immortality’, is it?” Hermes asked.
The middle-aged man admitted this with a rather delighted look on his face.
“Exactly. That person will die, of course. But the person who inherited his memories would misinterpret it, and will come to the conclusion that he lives forever because he has memories of the past.”
“That makes sense.”
“However, for someone else, the fact that ‘a person who remembers about me’ will continue to exist, regardless of appearance, doesn’t change. This is a system for others to see that ‘someone is continuing to live forever’.”
“I see…”
“I get it.”
Kino and Hermes confirmed their understanding.
“You mean, that person received the memories at least four times?” Kino asked.
“Yes. From his resulting behavior, we can say that for certain. Those memories were definitely inherited, and even now, continues to accumulate. He is a test subject of an enormous national experiment. Be it by illness, accident, or old age, at any rate, once he dies, a person will be chosen at random to receive all the memories accumulated until now.”
“Then the person who will be the container for the memories…will become a sacrifice?” Hermes asked.
“It’s fine even if you see it that way. You can also call them as the children of the parents who, in circumventing the strict limit on having children, gambled on the chance that this would not happen after they have accepted the possibility that it could. When the test subject dies, the memories will be transferred to a five-year-old among them.”
“Therefore, if you were lucky not to have your child ‘used’, you can have more children than the specified limit,” Hermes said. The middle-aged man nodded firmly.
“Yes. And there are many such people in this country.”
“I understand… Please continue.”
“Yes— But the point is that ‘this is an ongoing experiment’. At least, you must understand that this is not a country who spouts out mentally-ill people.”
“I understand that. I withdraw my statements earlier. I apologize.”
“That’s right. I’m sorry.”
Upon hearing this, the middle-aged man gave a big nod albeit somewhat proudly.
“Incidentally, what is the purpose of this experiment?”
“Eh? Oh. To learn ‘how many generations the human brain can withstand accumulating memories from’.”
“Then, if the results come out, and if things go smoothly, what will you do? You will do this to everyone?”
The middle-aged man vehemently shook his head in reaction to Hermes’ question.
“Preposterous! It’s just the opposite.”
“Eh?”
“Huh?”
“Although we developed this system, no matter how much we look at it, we can only conclude that it should not be used. The conclusion our ancestors came to, that ‘it is a mistake for humans to have another person inherit their memories at their convenience.’ was correct. Even now, we think this way, and we believe that if this system were to be utilized, it will be the end if this country.”
“But the experiment…”
“But the experiment…”
Kino and Hermes said the same thing at the same time.
“… The experiment will be continued, right?” Kino finished the question for both of them.
“Yes. It is to completely prove that ‘this system is wrong’.”
“…”
“…”
“So that it will never be used, we have to prove how dangerous this system is. If we do so, then no one will ever think that this is a ‘wonderful’ thing.”
“Well, I suppose that’s right…”
“This experiment began with forty test subjects. During the course of the study, we expected that by the third generation, the accumulation of memories will become unbearable. Thirty-nine of the test subjects exhibited this. They all went mad.”
“…”
“…”
“He is the last one. If he becomes insane, then the danger of this system will be 100% proven, and this system will be sealed for eternity. We will continue to observe, investigate, and take records generation after generation—until the day he becomes insane.”


Under the pallid moonlight, amidst the flower fields bathed with its brightness.
“I’ll try to roast it properly today.”
The black-jacketed Kino was holding up two skewered steaks above a bonfire made from dried grass. It roasted, and the sound of fat falling off was heard.
Hermes was parked beyond the bonfire, the moonlight and the fire being reflected off his tank.
While carefully roasting the meat, Kino sprinkled a pinch of salt and pepper from a small bag. She didn’t forget to prepare a plate, knife, and fork on top of the bag unloaded from Hermes.
“What a wonderful steak. I won’t be able to eat something like this for a while. —I will memorize its taste, so that I won’t ever forget.”
“Penny-pincher!” Hermes said with an appalled expression.
“Being able to forget things you want to forget, and being able to remember things you want to remember, is such a great thing, you know,” Kino said as she quickly reversed the meat.
Kino put the grilled meat in the plate and started to eat. When she had finished the meat, she cut up the fruits and ate it up.
“I’m happy,” Kino muttered as she looked up at the round moon.
“There are a lot of things, but I’m happy that I can remember after all. —It’s possible that I feel warm right now because I remember the cold of winter.”
“I don’t really get it,” Hermes grumbled with no interest, and teased, “It may be that motorrads completely forget things once they sleep at night.”
“That may be true. Nope, I’m sure it is,” Kino moved her gaze to Hermes and replied with a meek expression.
“Oh, why?”
“See Hermes, you can’t wake up properly in the morning even if I take the trouble of telling you the night before: ‘We’re leaving tomorrow so wake up early.’ I reminded you last night, too.”
After Kino answered the question, Hermes kept silent for a good dozen of seconds before speaking.
“You did?”


"
51,v7c6,7,6,"“A Land That Wants the Man”

A long, long time ago, there were two people and one animal on a journey.
One of the two was a young man who always wore a green sweater. He was a strong and kind person who had lost his homeland due to tragic circumstances.
The other one was a white-haired, green-eyed girl who was constantly silent. At those times, she didn’t like the world that much.
The animal was a big dog covered with white, fluffy fur; a clever creature who could use the human language.
Having met in strange circumstances, the two humans and the animal began their journey together. Setting off from a nameless beach, they started their aimless journey in search of a place to settle in, aboard a buggy, riding across a vast, vast land.
And one day, they arrived at a certain country.


“We beg you, traveler! Please live in this country! Please!”
The citizens of the country beseeched the male traveler with all their might.
The traveler was very surprised. That’s because every single person he saw and met in the country were all female.
“Please stay in this country!”
Upon hearing their story, he understood why. For a long time, male babies weren’t being been born in their country. As a result, the number of males have dropped, and now they are in big trouble.
The male traveler pondered for a moment. He was yet to decide as to what kind of country he liked to live in. However,
‘The place that I wish to be in is a place that wishes for me to be there.’
Having that in mind, he began to think that it wouldn’t be a bad idea to be of use to the people living in this country. —At least until the citizens said this:
“We no longer need any more females in this country. It’s regretful, but we can’t allow that girl with you to stay here.”
And after that, a great clamour ensued.
The male traveler asked them to let the girl stay because he took on a duty to protect this girl. The citizens would absolutely not allow it, as they couldn’t stand increasing the number of females any more.
Things soon came to a head. Terrifying thoughts occurred to them: It would be fine if they could seize the girl and chase her out of the country, or, they might as well kill her.
Several women took hold of kitchen knives and rolling pins, and began to attack the girl.
But the girl refused to stay quiet. Well, actually, she didn’t say anything—but as a counter-attack, she hurled lots of deafening and blinding grenades all over the town.
The male traveler, in giving his all to make sure that no one got hurt, became the one who got hurt the most.
The two humans and the animal escaped away from the country aboard the buggy.
“Ow,” the male traveler muttered as he drove. A bit of blood was coming out from his mouth, there were bruises on his forehead, and his sweater was torn in places.
The girl who only gazed at his state from the side, with a very tiny voice, and with all honesty, whispered,
“Thank you.”
But because of the sound of the wind, it seems that the man failed to hear her.

“A Land That Wants the Girl”

The next place that awaited the two humans and the animal was a very tiny kingdom in a valley.
The male traveler asked if he could stay there for a while, as he was willing to work. Unfortunately, because of the country’s policy, he was told that he can’t become a citizen. In the end, he was given permission to stay for only three days to rest and shop for supplies.
As it was very rare for travelers to come to this country, the king accepted them as the country’s special guests. Not only were they given a place to stay, they were also invited to a lunch just before their departure. Before the lunch started, the male traveler seated at the end of a big table looked around restlessly.
When the white dog asked what he was doing, the male traveler answered that he was wondering whether only the king lived a luxurious life while the rest of the citizens suffered.
“Well, what do you think?” the dog asked.
The man answered that from what he has seen, it seems that it was not the case, and that the king was trusted by the citizens. “That’s a good thing, isn’t it?” said the dog.
Soon, the king, the queen and the prince entered, and the lunch began.
The traveler was introduced, and the man greeted them with flawless grace, that the people around us, who thought that all travelers were more or less rude, were surprised.
The prince of this country was a boy around ten years of age. Perhaps because of boredom as the banquet progressed, he took a butler along with him and walked around the room. Upon doing so, he set eyes on the girl.
“Good day. I am this country’s prince.”
“…”
“When I grow up, I’ll work hard and govern this country with all that I can.”
“…”
“I believe this country is really wonderful. I have a very important duty.”
“…”
The girl’s reply each time was only to silently stare at the prince, but the prince was having fun. The king who was observing them somehow gained interest on the girl. He asked the male traveler about her. The man truthfully answered that she was ‘abandoned by her parents, and having lost a home, travels together with him in search for a place to settle in.’ 
“In that case!” The king said in delight. “In that case, then I would like to have her as my son’s queen,” he said.
The male traveler was a bit surprised, but having immense perceptiveness, he knew deep inside that this was for the girl’s sake.
And so, the male traveler spoke to the girl who only stared at the prince, “What do you think? I don’t think it’s a bad deal at all.”
The girl’s response was a punch.
The girl clenched her right fist tightly, and hit the male traveler squarely at the jaw.
The girl ignored the astonished male traveler and the dumbfounded guests, and turned back to the prince. Then she waved her tiny white hands, and only said,
“Bye bye.”
“Sure. If we get a chance, let’s meet again,” the prince said.
The girl dragged the confounded man who was still pressing on his chin, and together with the white dog, left the banquet.
The two humans and the animal soon left the country

“A Land That Wants the Dog”

After that, the two humans and the dog found a moderately-sized country by a lake.
From the outside, it looked like a perfectly normal country. The male traveler knocked on the door of the guardpost beside the gates. When he was about to ask permission to enter from the sentry who just came out,
“Whoa!”
Suddenly, the guard exlaimed as if there was something wrong with his hearing, that the two humans and the animal were stunned.
The sentry pushed some sort of switch on the wall, and a shrill alarm rang along with the opening of the heavy-looking gates.
And then the sentry knelt down right where he stood,
“Your Dogship!”
And bowed to the white dog at the feet of the traveler.
Soon after, the astounded pair were almost driven off by the wave of people coming from behind. They came rushing from the country, shouting things like, ‘It’s His Dogship!’ ‘Our Majestic Dog!’ ‘My, Your Dogship!’ 
“Welcome! Welcome! Please come in!”
Welcomed by a lot of people, the white dog passed through the completely opened gates. Having no other choice, the pair of humans left the buggy outside the walls and walked along.
On the other side of the gates was a big plaza were more people have gathered. The crowd was still growing.
There were too many people that the ground beneath them could no longer be seen. When the white dog came into full view, having been urged to climb a pedestal, the masses’ cheers made the ground rumble. Everyone knelt and bowed their heads.
A citizen spoke to the clueless male traveler and the silent girl beside the pedestal.
“Thank you very much for accompanying His Dogship to us!”
The male traveler asked him what’s going on.
“You didn’t know? —If you have come here without knowing anything, then this must be fate! How wonderful!”
The man asked once more for an explanation and finally received an answer. This country had revered dogs for a long time. But several years ago, a disease drove all dogs in the country to extinction, and the citizens were terribly distraught by it.
“You’ll stay in this country from here on, won’t you? Your Dogship!”
“Now, what shall I do?” the dog asked.
The male traveler answered casually, “Do as you like.”
“You! How dare you utter such disrespectful words to His Dogship!”
The man was seized. Two burly men surrounded him and grabbed both of his arms. In reality, the male traveler could have struggled and escaped, but he didn’t put up any resistance.
“…”
The girl silently approached the white dog on the pedestal, then pointed toward the arrested traveler, as if to say, ‘Do something.’
“Your dogship! Please allow us to put this ill-mannered man to death!” a citizen said.
“Wait,” the dog haughtily answered.  “An execution is a waste of time. Throw him out of the country.”
“Y-yes!” The citizens bowed their heads once more.
“…”
*Smack*. The girl hit the head of the white dog.
“How dare you do such a thing to His Dogship!”
And so, the girl was also seized.
“What shall we do with them?”
When the white dog was asked such, he declared, “Deport them together.”
The two travelers were lifted and carried away to the gates where they had passed through but moments earlier. And then they were thrown outside.
“You two better be grateful for His Dogship’s benevolence!”
The gates started to close with a clatter. Then, just before it completely closed off, the white dog suddenly jumped off the pedestal, ran through the spaces between the people’s legs, and passed through the tiny opening of the gates to the outside. And right before the dazed crowd, the heavy gates closed up.
The male traveler and the girl were aboard the buggy.
“Is this really all right, Riku?” the traveler on the driver’s seat asked the white dog in an amused tone.
“…”
The girl beckoned silently from the passenger seat. 
The white dog ran to the buggy and settled between the girl’s legs, then spoke with a dignified air,
“We may go now.”
*Smack*. The girl hit the head of the white dog. Then she placed her chin on top of it in an embrace.
“You’re heavy,” the dog answered.
“…”
The girl only silently hugged the fluffy white dog. With a laugh, the male traveler started the engine and launched the buggy off.
“Open it quick!”
“What are you doing?!”
“Ah! His Dogship!”
They quickly rode away from the clamoring citizens beyond the walls.


“—The end.”
“Eh, that’s it?!”
“Tell us more about the traveler, the girl and the white dog!”
“That’s all for today. There are lots more stories about the two people and the dog, but it wouldn’t be interesting if I tell them all at once. We’ve drunk up all the tea, too.”
“Aw.”
“Hmph.”
“Another time, okay? Next time, I will tell you more exciting stories.”
“It’s a promise!”
“It’s settled then!”
“I know. It’s a promise.”
“Then we’ll come again!”
“Again!”
“You’re welcome anytime. Be careful on your way home.”
“Yup!”
“Bye!”
“Goodbye. See you again.”
“—Grandma.”
“Oh, did you forget something?”
“No, there’s a guest for you at the entrance who wants to know about routes and countries; a traveler who came to this country by motorrad.”
“Dear me, how rare. Let’s get to know this fellow then. I wonder what kind of person it is?”


"
52,v7c7,7,7,"A knife grazed horizontally over the head of a crouching Kino. Several strands of her short black hair danced in the sky.
With her lowered posture, Kino raised the black knife she was holding in her right hand overhead. She aimed at the wrist that just passed above her head towards the left, and exerted both of her legs to reach it with the pointed end of the knife.
But Kino’s knife passed through empty air. The moment Kino realized that her attack did not get through, she retreated immediately to the back. A thin dust rose from the ground beneath her feet.
Kino positioned her knife while glaring at her opponent. The leather gloves covering up her wrist made a sound from tightly clenching the knife.
Kino wore green cargo pants and a gray sweater with pads stitched on the elbows and shoulders. On her feet were rubber-soled sneakers that are easy to move in, and there were goggles strapped tightly around her eyes. Sweat ran down her forehead, hit the frame of her goggles, and slowly scattered.
Kino’s opponent was a tall man with an athletic build. He was middle-aged, and the hairline of his short brown hair had receded considerably. He wore dark sunglasses that concealed his gaze. The deep blue short sleeves of his shirt covered the steel-like muscles of his thick-as-logs upper arms. His short pants exposed his similarly thick thighs. His simple appearance was accentuated by the thick socks and black short boots on his feet.
The man’s right hand grasped a blunt, long and narrow, silver knife.
“Yes, that low dodge has a good feel to it, Kino,” the man spoke kindly. His breathing was perfectly stable; he was calm, as if he was sitting comfortably in a couch in his own room.
“Thanks…” Kino replied curtly, still glaring and confronting the man. Then, she exhaled once or twice, steadying her breathing.
“You should at least look sincerely happy when you’re praised!” Hermes, who was parked on his center stand beside the road where the two stood, spoke without a drop of tension in his tone.
The road flanked between the trees stretched straight ahead. Behind the roadside where Hermes was propped was a log cabin with the dense forest serving as its backdrop. All of its windows were slightly open, and the sheets hung to dry over the terrace shook gently with the early summer breeze. Inside a stable beside the cabin, there was a horse gazing peacefully at the two.
“Now then,” the man spoke, quickly curling his back like a cat. He drew back his left foot lightly, bent both knees gently, and held the knife in his right hand in front of his body. The knife looked exactly like a real one, but it was only made of hard rubber for training purposes, with its blade portion painted in silver.
“…”
Still silent, Kino tightened her grip on her rubber knife. The one she was holding was neither long nor short. She also readily assumed her fighting stance.
As the man approached little by little, Kino glared at the eyes behind the sunglasses.
Without drawing back, Kino maintained a similar stance to the man’s, and waited for her opponent to come closer.
The man flexibly swung his right arm, the edge of the blade dancing and drawing a circle. While moving his upper body limply, he took one more step, approaching with his feet sliding forward.
When the distance between the two has become shorter than Hermes’ overall length,
“—Hup!”
Kino exhaled sharply and charged forward. From her initial posture, she thrust her body forward with immense force. She stretched out the knife’s blade, targeting the man’s right wrist.
The man bent his elbow and pulled back his right arm. He folded his left knee and lowered his body, throwing it to the left at the same time. His right arm brushed inwards, reaching out with the knife to the back of Kino’s right knee.
“Haah!”
“Ooh.”
It was Kino’s yell, and the man expressing his admiration.
As preparation for a side kick, Kino gave her right knee a big bend and raised her feet. The man’s knife was underneath the rubber soles of Kino’s shoes. With Kino’s stomp kick, the man’s knife flipped away to the border of the road and the forest.
As a backlash of her kick, Kino’s left leg half-turned to the back. At the same time, the man turned to the opposite direction and returned to his original stance, immediately taking some distance away.
“Oh, not bad.”
Before Hermes finished expressing his amazement, Kino plunged towards the unarmed man. Joining her left hand with the right hand that gripped the knife, she pressed her arms against her belly and hardened the pit of her stomach.
“—Hyaah!”
Along with a yell and a frantic form, she charged her body towards the man.
“Could this be her win?” Hermes let out his thoughts.
Only three steps were needed for the rushing Kino to clear the distance between her and the man.
With Kino’s first step, the man’s lips formed a broad smile; in the middle of her second step, the man, with a backhand, pulled out a different rubber knife from the pocket of his short pants. On the third step, while drawing his body in rhythm with his right foot, he thrust the rubber knife towards the right flank of the charging Kino.
“Guh—!”
With the rubber knife plunged on her side as the fulcrum, Kino was blown by her own force. Her body soared in the sky for about two seconds before dropping on the ground and rolling, her face ramming the grass by the roadside.
“Oops.”
“Gack—!”
Along with Hermes disappointed voice, Kino let out a gasp. Kino vomited a copious amount of saliva on the grass, and rolled over the road two or three times while moaning in pain. Her face, head, and body turned brown from the dust.
The man who did not break a single sweat picked up the knife that flew away and put it back in his pocket. Then he went to Hermes’  side and waited for Kino to get up.
After about thirty seconds, the ragged Kino slowly got up from the ground. She brushed away the dust all over her body, wiped off the mixed sludge from her sweaty face, and removed her goggles.
“…”
Without fixing her unkempt hair covered in dust, she walked up in front of the man and bowed her head.
“Thank you very much.”
“Mhm. Today’s practice is over.” The man’s smile showed below the sunglasses.
“That crouching dodge at the beginning was really good. That time, I was thinking of going for your throat, but you dodged it well. And the succeeding low-cut backflip with your leg, did you plan that right from the start?”
Kino nodded. “Yes. I knew that I wouldn’t cut the wrist from my first attack. And from my previous defeat, I anticipated that you would aim for the back of my knee. Once I got rid of the knife, I thought I should try charging forward.”
“Pretty good. ―And after that?”
“And then, as I was taught before, I put all of my weight and charge with a deep stab for the final blow, but…”
“You did not expect that I’m hiding another knife?”
“… I never considered it.”
“That is another reason why you are defeated this time,” the man said frankly, and slapped his big palms together.
“That’s everything for today. As usual, I’ll come the day after tomorrow. ―But if this were a real fight, there will be no next time.”


“You ‘died’ again, huh? If that fight’s for real, you’re a goner, Kino.”
“I know, Hermes.”
Kino and Hermes saw off the man who left on horseback. Kino’s appearance was still dirty from her training, but now there was a holster wrapped around her hips, and a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol), a large-caliber revolver hung inside it.
When the man was already out of sight, Kino pulled out the revolver from her hip. With her left hand she quickly raised the hammer and fired one shot just above her waist. The bullet hit a frying pan hanging from the branch of a tree a few meters away. After that, she fired five shots in a row, and the sound of lead bullets piercing steel was heard five times.
“Great. You still hit perfectly even though you’re angry. Good job,” said Hermes.
“…”
Kino silently returned the revolver in the holster.
As if the gunshots were signals, an old woman with long silver hair tied neatly on her back came out from the log cabin. She wore an apron, with a short revolver suspended inside a holster behind her waist. From the terrace, the old woman gently called out to Kino.
“‘Dead’ again, Kino?” Well anyway, wash your face and change your clothes, then let’s have some tea.”


A round wooden table was placed on the log cabin’s spacious terrace. The laundry sheets were put away and the rope used to hung them wound up.
The old woman and Kino sat in front of their teacups while the scattered, white clouds floating in the sky hid and revealed the sun.
“Smells good,” the old woman said cheerfully as she lifted the cup with blue onions painted on its white background, and took a sip.
“…”
She returned the cup on the top of the saucer while looking at Kino’s disappointed face.
“I did not win…,” Kino muttered. “Before this, I lost fifty-four times already. I ‘died’ fifty-four times.”
The old woman put her elbows on the table, and rested her chin on her joined fingertips. She gazed amusingly at the person before her, Kino, whose hair was still a little bit dirty with the dust.
“This training is such a good thing. If it were not, I wouldn’t have had fifty-five Kino’s to accompany me to tea.”
“Somehow, imagining that there are fifty-five of Kino gives me a bad feeling. But that would make polishing my wheels a breeze,” Hermes said while parked on the raised slope at the edge of the terrace.
Kino easily ignored Hermes’ remark, and stared intently at the old woman’s face. “I did not win… But someday, will I be able to defeat that knife-user?”
The old woman nodded with a smile. “Yes, you will, Kino. You can win. If you challenge him with your own knowledge and experience, and demonstrate your skill, you can win anytime.”
“But…”
“Look for something in your defeat, something with more value than winning.”
“… Yes.”
“If you are not capable of defeating that person, it will be impossible for you to travel like I have done in the past.”
“…”


The next day after the next day.
The sky was covered with lead-colored clouds. Neither the sun nor the sky itself could be seen. A strong wind kept blowing, making the clouds drift continuously. The forest was noisy from the rustle of its foliage.
Kino, who had her sweaters on, was digging a hole in the road. Using a shovel, she dug a hole that was neither too deep nor too big.
“Kino, isn’t that a bit extreme? Hey, are you listening?” Hermes called out to Kino from beside the cabin. Kino ignored him and continued to dig the hole. The old woman was nowhere in sight.
“Kino? Kino?”
“I don’t have a choice,” Kino answered while digging.
“How cowardly. Your strategy is so crazy, Kino.”
“I don’t care what anyone would say. If this were a ‘real fight’ in the middle of your journey―”
“If it were?”
“If I die, there will be no next time…”
“Well, fine. But is it okay to win with a strategy like this?”
Kino finished digging the hole, and returned to the cabin with the shovel on her shoulders. At that moment, while giving Hermes a glare, she answered,
“There will be no next time!”


Amidst the increasingly strong gusts of wind, a horse carrying a man came riding down the road.
Kino stood at the very middle of the road, waiting for the knife-user. She wore her gloves and goggles, with the rubber knife ready in her hands.
The man, who did not remove his sunglasses even though it was cloudy, stopped his horse’s strides.
“Good afternoon. Please take care of me today as well,” said Kino, whose eyes beneath the transparent goggles showed an unusually delighted expression.
“That’s a nice look you have today.”
Then he got off and put the horse in the stable.
The man returned on the road, and took a distance away from Kino who waited for him with an imposing stance. He absent-mindedly took out the rubber knife from his pocket and turned and grasped the knife lightly in his hands.
“Let’s begin. ―En garde.”
“Yes.”
Amidst the fierce noises in the forest, the man bent his knee and assumed his stance.
And then Kino took three steps back from her position.
“?” The man slightly tilted his head.
A broken tree branch rolled from where she stepped back. Kino’s feet avoided the branch so as not to step on it.
The next moment, Kino let go of the knife she was holding in her right hand. Before it fell to the ground, she intentionally stepped on the branch with her right foot. A powerful force ensued.
“What?” came the man’s surprised voice. The branch served as a lever, and something sprung up from beneath the ground. Inside the hole, a large-caliber revolver covered in dusty cloth appeared, rotating slowly, and danced in the air to Kino’s right side.
“—Ha!” The man charged with a speed that did not match his large body. The enlarged muscles of his legs kicked on the ground.
While looking at the man’s form, Kino did not panic and remained impassive. She swung down her right hand. The revolver in the air was now in Kino’s hand.
Kino raised the hammer with her thumb, aimed at the charging man’s bulky chest, and pulled the trigger.
There was a dull explosive sound.
The bullet engulfed in white smoke hit the man’s belly.
“Guh!”
Beyond this, the man did not show any sign of the damage he received, but his legs stopped. The rubber bullet bounced off the man’s chunky abs, then dropped and fell at his feet.
The man and Kino stood face to face a few steps away from each other. The man’s mouth spread into an amused smile.
Kino fired. The second and third bullets hit the man’s chest where the heart is located. Each rubber bullet did not miss aim, and rolled down beside the man. As the last gunshot faded away, the sound of the wind reclaimed the surroundings.
“I won,” Kino said, still holding the revolver in her lowered right hand.  
The cabin door opened. The old woman who came out gazed at the two from the top of the terrace. Kino looked up at the old woman.
“I won,” she said tersely.
Hermes interrupted with a mumble.
“No, that was cheating, wasn’t it?”


“Ahaha! Ahahaha! Finally, you defeated me!”
The man’s lively laughter drowned the sound of the wind.
“Ahahahaha! You finally did it! Yes, how wonderful!”
Not only the man, but the old woman also seemed glad. “That’s right. Thank you for all your hard work up until now.”
“Whatever you say. It was very fun and interesting. Back when you were teaching me, and even now.”
Kino left, silently observing the two; the old woman and the man seemed happy.
The two talked a little bit about future plans, and expressed their gratitude to each other.
“Kino. You’re wonderful!”
The man left with these words and said nothing more, as he straddled his horse and ordered it to gallop. With a good mood, he rocked on top of the horse, and left on the road where he came from.
Kino stood alone in the middle of the road. Hermes was beside her, while the old woman was left on top of the terrace. The old woman called out to her.
“Kino.”
“Yes.”
The old woman smiled at her. “You won.”
“―Yes.”
“Well, is that all right?” asked Hermes.
“Of course. You saw it too, didn’t you? Kino prepared, and won.”
“That’s true. But using a persuader instead of a knife…isn’t that unfair?”
“The old woman nodded deeply. “Yes. Very unfair.”
“Eh?”
“Kino. —Did you think it was unfair? That what you did was so cowardly?”
This time, Kino nodded clearly. “Yes. It was a sly and cowardly trick. But, because of that, I won. I did not ‘die’.”
“It’s wonderful, don’t you think? I thought that it was very well done,” the old woman above the terrace wore a smile all over her face.
“Is it really okay?”
“Yes, it is,” The old woman gave a firm answer to Hermes’ question, then turned her gaze to Kino. “Kino, you’re fairly skilled in knife combat. You have shown amazing progress. For now, even if you set out on a journey, you’re probably skilled enough to protect yourself. Even so, the reason why you could never win against that man, is the gap in your experiences, and most of all the difference in your physiques. That’s why, no matter how many times you fight with him, you will probably never win. Be it a hundred times or two hundred times, you will still lose. You will still ‘die’.”
“…”
“When you have no choice but to fight in order to protect yourself or someone else, the most important thing you have to remember is the ‘element of surprise’. Leaving your opponent unprepared, rendering yourself unreachable by his persuader, setting up a one-sided attack—if these conditions are not available, you should do your best to attain them, even if you have to escape for the meantime. The more cowardly the tactic, the more reliable it is. —In sum, that’s what we wanted to teach you with this training. You realized that on your own, and admirably accomplished your task. That man looked very happy, and I too, felt like a young woman once again.”
“Thank you very much, Master.” For the first time that day, a smile appeared on Kino’s face.
“But somehow…,” Hermes muttered while looking at Kino and the old woman.
“Well then Kino, shall we move on to the next training? Or do you want to take a little break?”
“Right away, please!”
While looking at the delighted Kino, the old woman grinned and laughed.
“Keep up that spirit. But first, kindly fire off all of your remaining rubber bullets.”
“Yes.”
Three consecutive gunshots. When Kino turned around and fired the three shots, all the rubber bullets traced a mountain-like trajectory and hit the frying pan.
Kino looked back to the old woman.
“Well now, the next one ―”
“Yes.”
The old woman reached out her hand behind her waist, and opened the cover of the holster. She held the grip of the revolver in it.
“For the next one, we will be doing training for unexpected gunfights. You, with me. We will be sparring using rubber bullets from morning until night, inside the forest, and also inside the house. You may fire any time you see an opening. Always think that you are being targeted; acting under pressure is the best sort of training.”
“Eh?”
“Then let’s start.”
As soon as she said this, she pointed the barrel of the short revolver towards Kino.
“Eh?”
Kino looked at her right hand, still holding the revolver she emptied out earlier, and then raised up her face in surprise. Her eyes met with the old woman’s, who was smiling, and aiming at her with her right hand.
“Ah―”
Bang.


“Just like this, you can never loosen your guard at all times. Never forget to prepare your persuader. A persuader without a bullet is nothing but deadweight.”
The old woman happily left these words and went inside the house.
On the road, Kino touched the bruise on her forehead,
“…”
Lifted up her face, and gazed at the flowing clouds.
“Kino?” Hermes asked.
“Ahaha—!” While laughing, Kino answered.
“Unfair.”


"
53,v7c8,7,8,"My name is Riku. I am a dog.
I have long, shaggy white fur. My face makes me look as if I’m happy and smiling all the time, but it doesn’t mean that I am. I was just born this way.
Shizu is my master. He is a young man who always wears a green sweater, and has been traveling by buggy ever since he lost his homeland due to complex circumstances.


Just before this, Master Shizu was stabbed with a knife and sustained a rather critical wound. But with adequate treatment from the person who helped us, and with Master Shizu’s naturally tough constitution, the wound did not become fatal.
After the person who helped us has left, for Master Shizu’s body to recuperate completely, we stayed for a while in a beach where no one else visits and let several days pass by in peace.
And during that time, various objects were washed ashore.
Waterproof wooden boxes full of food, bottles of water, all sorts of ammunition and bombs, cans of fuel, bags of clothes. And at times, even valuable articles.
All of these, without a doubt, came from “that country”. As to what has become of this country, I do not know.


Muffled explosions reached us in the interior of the tent that was brightly illuminated by the morning sun. Twice, in succession. And then it became quiet.
“Going at it again, huh,” Master Shizu said with a laugh. While he sat cross-legged, he slowly removed the bandage from his stomach. When he has finally removed the gauze, he found that the wound beneath it has fully healed. There were the traces of a scar from a wound that was roughly stitched. It will probably remain there for the rest of his life.
“It’s all right now. Once we finish preparations, we can leave immediately,” Master Shizu said as he put on a T-shirt. Then he wore his usual green sweater on top of it.
“What will become of Ti?” I asked of the girl who caused Master Shizu’s wound. Right now, this person is in a nearby rocky area, catching our breakfast in a rather violent manner by throwing hand grenades underwater.
Master Shizu answered with a laugh, “We’ll be fine with the buggy.”


Food and fuel, change of clothing, items that seemed sellable, Ti’s beloved hand grenades and the springing knife—those were the only things Master Shizu packed in the buggy. Yet the buggy was now one size larger.
On the driver’s seat was Master Shizu, wearing a parka over his sweater, and goggles around his eyes.
And on the passenger’s seat was the green-eyed, white-haired girl, who wore a baggy black jacket as a coat; it was one of the items washed ashore that she had grown fond of.
Having lost my previous spot, I settled between her skinny legs in a rather stiff posture.
“I’m indebted. I will never forget this scenery.”
“…”
Leaving these words of salutation, we left the beach where we have spent many days.
The surface of the sea reflected in the side mirror gradually became farther away, and was soon no longer in sight. The buggy ran with the hum of the engine in excellent condition.
“It’s all right. I’m sure we’ll soon find a country pleasant to stay in.”
So as not to lose to the sound of the warm gust of wind, Master Shizu spoke with a cheerful and reassuring tone to Ti.
“…”
Ti was as silent and as expressionless as ever.
‘We’ll soon find.’ 
That probably won’t be the case, I thought.
And perhaps, that sort of thing doesn’t matter.


A spring shower drizzled over a vast prairie.
The temperature was neither high nor low, and the humidity was tolerable enough.
Here and there were big trees. The buggy stopped under one such tree.
A blue vinyl sheet was stretched on top of the car’s body for protection against the rain. One end was tied to the bumper, and another on a branch of the tree.
Big raindrops would occasionally fall from the branches and leaves, and drop with a plop on the tarp. Each time, Ti would look up from the passenger seat then return her gaze to the front. *Plop*. Then she would again look up.
Master Shizu lightly closed his eyes while in the driver’s seat, while I crouched over the hood, as we waited for the rain to let up. If the rain continued for the whole day, they will have to wear their rain gear and continue driving, but for now we’re taking a break. The sun peeks through the rifts in the clouds from beyond the horizon, so it will probably not take long before the rain stops.
“I wonder what kind of country the next one will be…?” Master Shizu muttered with his eyes still closed. As usual, Ti,
“…”
Said nothing. Her green eyes only took a glance at the driver’s seat, then turned back her gaze.
I myself don’t have an answer to this question. No one could possibly know what kind of place it will be. There are many countries in this world, and none of them are completely alike.
But before that, we should worry about whether we would be able to find a country in this vast meadow. Even so, Master Shizu was optimistic, believing that it will be all right as long as we find a road.
The rain was still falling, but the clouds were already disappearing overhead. The sun shined down on us, and the blue sheet gleamed with the light.
Master Shizu unfastened the strings and folded up the sheet. An enormous rainbow formed in the sky ahead of us.
Upon a closer look, it was a twin rainbow.


While trodding over wet grass, the buggy ran in perfect condition over the prairie. It was headed west.
Before we set off, I feared that Ti would get nauseous from the jolts, but it seems that my worries were all for nothing. Ti was not the least agitated by the hard seat (well, there was a cushion underneath), the tight seatbelt, or the shaking of the vehicle.  And it seemed that she even enjoyed the sceneries that greeted her eyes for the first time in her life. Upon seeing the deer and the large prairie animals in the distance,
“…”
She craned her neck as far as it would go to follow the animals with her gaze.
We spent the whole day running through the prairie, and by dusk, we discovered a lone road.
The road that ran along the north-south direction, had tire tracks on it. It must be a road that connected one country to another. Just like Master Shizu said, if we follow this road, we would be able to arrive to some country. To decide whether to follow the north or the south, Master Shizu dug his hand into a bag behind the seat and took out a coin, which he then placed into Ti’s hands.
“…”
Master Shizu explained to Ti, who was looking at the coin curiously. “You decide by throwing that. If it comes out heads, we’ll go south, if tails, we’ll go north.”
Ti nodded deeply, then threw the coin with her left hand. With all her strength.
The coin drew a parabola and dropped about ten meters away into the grassy plains.
“Ah. Riku, please fetch it.”
It was heads. We headed south.
That evening, Master Shizu put up a tent in the middle of the prairie. And inside it—
“In this kind of wind, you can throw it lightly and let the air seize it. You place it at the back of your other hand—”
—He was teaching Ti how to toss a coin.


The next morning.
While basking in the dazzling sunlight from our left, the buggy continued on the road going south.
Master Shizu and I normally don’t engage much in conversation while traveling. Nothing changed, except Ti was with us— Well, of course, Ti only stared tirelessly at the sceneries without saying a word.
Having meandered around for a while, it was soon lunchtime.
“I see it.”
Those were Master Shizu’s first words for the day. Then he pointed forward. The gray walls were slowly appearing from underneath the horizon. Ti turned her eyes towards that direction.
“…”
And only stared in silence.
“It seems like we don’t have to make our own lunch,” Master Shizu said.


We were given permission to enter without any problems, and at last, the mud-covered, luggage-filled buggy passed through the gates.
It was a big country. Even from afar, the wide walls could still be seen, and when we looked at the map located in the plaza in front of the gates, we could make out a warped area towards the southwest.
We rode through the country. It was a very orderly country. People walked around the tidy downtown lined up with traffic lights and clean cars running through it. There were no tall buildings, but it was only because they were not needed in such a spacious country. The public order also seemed good.
After passing through the town, we headed to the outskirts, with fields visible all around. Just as the immigration officer told us, we soon arrived at an inexpensive hotel with a parking space. It was a wide, one-storey building.
Usually, Master Shizu would take the cheapest and smallest room, but this time, he took a room with two beds in it.
Master Shizu enjoyed a longed-for shower, and washed me while he’s at it. Of course, I humbly declined, though I was undoubtedly, dirty.
It seems that Ti didn’t understand what a bath tub was for, but with Master Shizu’s simple explanations, she immediately learned.  This girl was more adaptable than I thought.
In a nearby restaurant, where food was delivered immediately upon ordering, Master Shizu and Ti requested for bread with different kinds of cheese on top, and ate some well-cooked meals. Of course, it was probably Ti’s first time eating such food, and hence didn’t have any complaints. However, she didn’t seem too impressed as she was with the portable rations.
We spent that afternoon assigning tasks.
Master Shizu went to sell the objects that looked valuable, and bought the things that we needed. While waiting, Ti and I remained in the room to wash our clothes. Ti did what I told her to do. For the first time, this girl was being handy in a normal way.
“Now, there’s something I want to tell you.”
It was a more or less wonderful evening in our room. After our dinner, Master Shizu spoke to Ti, who sat opposite him on the round table.
“Looking around various countries, that is, ‘enjoying traveling’, is not our goal. I am looking for a country where I could settle down; a place where I could be useful to someone with the things that I am capable of.”
“…”
“I still don’t know everything about this country, and I’m planning to find out. So far, it doesn’t seem to be a bad country. Even the food is delicious.”
“…”
“Starting tomorrow, we’ll go around the country without any preconceptions or bias. If you notice anything, I would like you to tell me.”
“…”
“I also want you to be careful. There are many people who live in this country. Right now we are guests, so we should act the way travelers should. Be careful not to say or do anything that might hurt other people.”
This was some doubtful words coming from Master Shizu, who used to stick his neck into other people’s business, but this must be just a caution to Ti, who has yet no experience in traveling.
“You understand, right?”
Ti nodded sincerely and deeply, but what would happen later on will prove that she didn’t completely understand what she was just told.


The next day.
Master Shizu brought me and Ti along, and rode around the country. The weather was good.
Master Shizu was in his usual green sweater and jeans while Ti was wearing her long-sleeved, round-necked brown shirt and grey short pants. Aside from the fact that it was cleaner after being washed, there was nothing different.
Downtown, Master Shizu carried his sword in a bag. Ti carried her shoulder bag that seemed to contain a water bottle and portable rations inside.
We looked all over the wide country—the urban areas, the agricultural area, as well as the residential district.
As it was rare for the citizens to see a traveler, we were welcomed again and again. The residents in the urban district all gave way for our vehicle, while in the agricultural district, we were given tomatoes.
Master Shizu inquired about immigration, and learned that there would be little problem registering as a resident in the town hall, after which he could start working to earn money and pay for his taxes. Among the countries that accept strangers, it was really unusual to find one so generous.
As it has a democratic form of government, its representatives were chosen by an impartial election. Not too bad for Master Shizu, who have seen countries made fools by dictators and kings.
Its economy was also stable, and it seems that there are very few people who die of hunger. The citizens appeared to be living their lives in peace and happiness.
After the whole-day tour, Master Shizu came back to the room in high spirits.


“It’s a ‘normal country’.”
Master Shizu said. And he added that it was a difficult task for a normal country to work out, as the numerous people living in it should put in a lot of effort.
When I asked him if he liked it, Master Shizu nodded.
“I don’t think it’s a bad idea to try living here for a while.”
“…”
Ti was silent as always, and whether she agrees or not, or simply doesn’t care, no one could tell.
The next day as well, we went around the country to observe. It was a bit cloudier, and it looked like it’s going to rain.
But this country was just so big. Of course we have no idea who made it this way, but the walls ran even through plains and forests, as if these areas were enclosed just for the sake of being enclosed.
At the northern gates, we headed to a wide avenue going south just a few steps away. We vacated yesterday’s hotel.
The southern avenue was very lively. Cars were running through the street, and there were many people.
“…”
As it was filled with things that Ti has seen for the first time, no matter where we go and walk in, her head fidgeted about.
In one corner of a street lined up with big houses and shops, Master Shizu parked the buggy in a fuel refilling stand. In places like this, it’s a strict regulation to only get enough for your needs.
While we’re refilling, Ti and I stood on the walkway and looked at the rows of stores.
It was near noontime, and under the cloudy sky, there were housewives going out shopping and workers going out for lunch. When they saw us, some of them waved their hands and smiled.
At that moment, a man came out from the side of the fuel refilling station and walked towards us.
It was a man in his fifties. He was thin and barefooted, wearing only a white shirt and his underwear. At the same time, he was dyed red with blood.
The man was holding something in his right hand. It was the freshly severed head of a human. He held the head from its long hair, swaying and barely grazing the pavement. The blood dripped from it, leaving traces on the sidewalk.
“…”
Ti stared at the man. I believe he was about twenty meters away from us.
“Master Shizu!”
At the same time I called out to Master Shizu, the woman who was keeping watch on the fuel stand raised a scream. The man walked aimlessly towards us. His expression was calm, as if everything was normal.
I jumped out in front of Ti, and couldn’t decide whether to growl, howl, or talk. And the moment I realized that it really didn’t matter, Master Shizu jumped out in front of me holding the sword in the bag.
“I thought it wasn’t possible but…I guess that look is not normal in this country?” Master Shizu muttered. Well, a country with blood-soaked men carrying severed heads walking around normally sounds pretty nasty. 
Meanwhile, the half-crazed female employee screamed, “S-someone call the police! Police!”
When you think about it, an ordinary reaction for a passerby in situations like this is to scream.
“You, what do you think you’re doing? What’s that blood and head?”
Yet Master Shizu questioned the man like this.
“Shut up! Do you want to die too?”
Master Shizu moved as he heard this answer. He approached slowly and thrust the sword, scabbard, bag and all, towards the man’s stomach. The man let out a groan before collapsing.
The head fell to the sidewalk, rolled, and stopped on top of the cover of the gutter by the roadway.


It didn’t take long before a nearby police on rounds came. Master Shizu handed the man over.
As they did not know what happened, he reported what he saw and did to the police. The employees of the fuel refilling station vouched for us, so we were not suspected.
While muttering unintelligible words, the man was taken into custody. Pictures of the severed head were taken before it was put inside a bag. The pale-faced female employee came, and said that the man was the principal of a nearby kindergarten. They have been trying to call the kindergarten several times, but no one would pick up the phone, and no one would come out. This time, it was the policemen who turned pale.
Master Shizu followed after four policemen who set out. As Ti followed after Master Shizu, I had to look after her.
Some tens of meters away was the kindergarten building that looked like a miniature school. The bloodstains in the walkway led there, or rather, came from that place.
“Is anybody here?!”
A police called out, grabbed his hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case a pistol) then entered the building. I thought it was only natural for them to push us strangers out of the way, but maybe because they had no luxury of time to do so, they just allowed us to shamelessly follow from behind.
We headed to the place where the bloodstains originated, and came out to a wide room at the center of the building, and saw what was inside.
“Wah! Waa…”
A young policeman fainted and collapsed.
The whole room was filled with the stench of blood that it seemed more like a battlefield or an execution ground. Several corpses of beheaded women rolled about. They were probably day-care workers.
Copious amounts of blood seeped through the carpet on the floor, transforming the room into a crimson swampland. Within it, the tiny bodies of the kindergarten pupils tumbled about. A little over twenty. Everybody had white foams coming out of their mouths, the flicker in their faded eyes already gone. Paper cups were scattered about.
“…”
Amidst the speechless policemen, Master Shizu, and myself, only Ti spoke.
“Everybody’s dead.”


That day, we stayed in a hotel near the police station. That’s because we tagged along the on-site investigation until it was almost evening.
The place transformed into a place filled with agonizing wails. The parents of the kindergartners rushed as soon as they heard the story, and fainted and screamed upon seeing the faces of their children being carried out inside bags. Yellow tape was placed around the place, and the residents of the neighborhood and the people concerned gathered in swarms.
In the end, they discovered that all twenty-two kindergartners and six day-care workers were poisoned. Moreover, the adults were all beheaded. Their after-lunch tea was laced with a lethal poison.  There was almost no doubt that the kindergarten principal did everything by himself. They also found a bottle of poison and a blood-stained chainsaw. In one corner of the room, there was a huge pile of fuel. There was also a detonation apparatus set-up, but the handmade fuse was lost in the pool of blood.
It seems that Master Shizu was commended amidst it all, but he was not really interested. As there was no way for us to know beforehand or stop this massacre, he should be aware that we could have done nothing about the death of the children, but regardless, Master Shizu’s face remained gloomy.
Ti was the same as ever. She made short work of the dinner prepared for us.
That evening, the radio in our room continued to report the incident in an impassive and objective way as was possible. After listening to it for a while, Master Shizu spoke,
“If there are many people, this kind of thing also happens. —In poor countries, there are numerous crimes done by people to survive. But in countries as big and wealthy as this one, the opposite is true. I heard that those kinds of crimes are few, but in place, rare and bizarre crimes like this one happen. It’s really sad, but I guess there’s nothing we can do about it—”
This is an aside, but as a result of the confusion, the fuel for the buggy became practically free.


The next day.
The clouds hung even lower compared to yesterday. It wouldn’t be strange for it to rain at any moment.
After breakfast, Master Shizu headed to the police station. Ti and I followed. A middle-aged police chief appeared and let us in to a drawing room. The chief, together with his young lieutenant, sat with us at the table. Tea was served.
The chief thanked Master Shizu for cooperating with the police in arresting the perpetrator. Master Shizu asked if his testimony was necessary for the trial that will take place from then on. If needed be, though we had no idea how long it would take, he’s willing to extend his stay in the country.
The chief only shook his head.
“That won’t be necessary. That man will not be tried.”
Master Shizu’s eyebrows raised a little. My thoughts were that the gravity of this crime was such that it merits an automatic death penalty without trial, but I was mistaken. Instead the chief said this:
“That man, that principal’s actions, deviated from the norm.”
We already know that. Master Shizu also nodded.
“In this country, this kind of incident occurs once every few years. Bizarre mass murders. It’s very sad and deplorable.”
Just like Master Shizu said last night. I could still agree at this point.
“Those people were driven to their actions by an evil electromagnetic wave. That’s why we couldn’t punish them. That man will be considered innocent, and will be sent to a hospital to be isolated and receive treatment.”
This one I failed to understand.
“What do you mean?” Master Shizu leaned forward and asked.
The chief stood up with a heavy face and walked towards the window. He gazed outside. It was not yet raining.
“This country has a rather sad history…”
The chief turned around as he said this. Master Shizu and I awaited the continuation of his words.
“It seems that a long, long time ago, a large number of slaves were gathered in this country. This story was from hundreds of years ago, you see. In order to make the slaves work, tiny devices were implanted inside their heads.”
“Devices, you say?” Master Shizu’s question was answered by the seated lieutenant.
“A device that sends and receives electromagnetic waves like a radio. According to our records, it was used to control people… If they didn’t go to such extent, it would be impossible to control the slaves over this vast territory. That period continued for a while, and at some point in time, for some unknown reason, the slaves were set free and continued to live in this land. Well, as this was an unwelcome fact from our past, we rarely tell travelers about it.”
“I understand. I will not tell anyone about it. And so, what’s the connection of this history to the incident yesterday?” Master Shizu addressed the chief. The chief turned around, and answered with a sour expression,
“In this country, incidents such as the one you have witnessed yesterday were all caused by these devices and electromagnetic waves.”
“The electromagnetic waves’…fault?”
“That’s right.”
Master Shizu replied, and the chief confirmed confidently.
“In a forest to the west of the country, there is a vast area that everyone is banned to enter for eternity. Do you know what lies in that place?”
Master Shizu replied honestly that he didn’t know. He had seen the areas in the map, but we are yet to visit that area.
“Then I shall tell you. That forbidden area houses the ‘electromagnetic signal base’. It was a base used to send off the electromagnetic waves, once operated by our ancestors. It has a powerful generator and a large antenna. —People who could operate that base has long since died, but the device remains. Once in a while, the machine would suddenly send off electromagnetic waves, attacking our citizens, the descendants of the slaves. Those unlucky enough to receive the signals will give rise to sad incidents like yesterday’s, without regard to the person’s will. There is a constant possibility for anyone from this country to become like that kindergarten principal. Everyone in this country, including myself, dreads this. We couldn’t possibly sentence these individuals in accordance to common criminal laws. They are also victims. It’s not a question of the person’s responsibility. No matter what they did, we have no choice but to consider them innocent,” the chief declared with utmost seriousness. He returned to his seat, giving Master Shizu what looked like a glare.
“And as a police, I thank you for your actions yesterday. However, if you now have the impression that our country is a dangerous place for having crimes like that occur repeatedly, I want you to know that that is a big misinterpretation. In our country, there’s not a single person who truly wishes for such a thing to happen. It was all the electromagnetic waves’ fault. —Everyone understands that fact despite their suffering. And I want you to understand it too, traveler.”
In short, what he was trying to say was, ‘Outsiders like you who don’t know anything about our country should not have any wrong ideas.’
Master Shizu asked, “But then does this mean that the device has the ability to transmit its capabilities to the descendants?”
Just as expected, both the chief and his lieutenant looked somewhat injured by this remark. The lieutenant replied,
“Are you some sort of biologist, doctor, or physicist?”
“I am not any of those.”
“Then that question is slightly irrelevant. Our country has been plagued by this problem for years. It’s a reality set by our history,” the chief declared with much confidence.
Master Shizu changed the course of his inquiry.
“As this source of evil, the electromagnetic signal base, is no longer necessary, can’t you destroy it to resolve this problem?”
“You’d know the answer to that if you were listening closely,” the lieutenant began.
“If that were possible, we would have done it a long time ago. You can’t seem to wrap your head around the reason why it is forbidden to go near the electromagnetic signal base.  If we so much as approach the base, the signals become powerful. We would lose our will. I would prefer it if you don’t say things that are not possible.”
“I see. It seems that way. I understand.”
So Master Shizu said.
And then,
“Then let me undertake this task. As a traveler and a person not originally from this country, I suppose the electromagnetic waves will have no effect on me. If I succeed, then everyone can live from now on without worrying about the electromagnetic waves.”


While driving the buggy,
“Well it’s lucky that we get to observe a place where everyone else is forbidden to enter, but this feels rather gloomy,” Master Shizu said. We were running on the plains inside the country, with Ti on the passenger seat, and I between her legs. It was only a little before noon, and the weather was as cloudy as ever.
As a result of our conversation in the police station, we are now in the middle of a mission to scout and destroy the electromagnetic signal base. After we lost sight of the streets, we rode towards the west in the midst of the derelict grassland.
By the way, Master Shizu asked Ti to stay behind, but she bluntly ignored his wishes and seated herself on the passenger seat.
Master Shizu was in his sweater while Ti was in her black coat. We received a knapsack full of high power bombs from the police station. We have enough of those to easily destroy one building.
He has accepted this task but if I understood him correctly, Master Shizu did not really buy the ‘electromagnetic wave affects humans and so on’ talk. Same here.
Master Shizu continued. “Anyhow, that claim of a machine in their heads, remaining even after several generations is really something… However, the number of long-abandoned machines that are still in activity on its own that I have seen is not really zero.”
True. We’ve seen one just before this country. Though I can’t say much before we met Ti.
“That’s why there is a possibility that this electromagnetic base may still be moving on its own with a self-powered generator. If we take a picture as evidence that it has been completely destroyed, maybe the people will be relieved once and for all.”
“And we’ll be commended for it too. We can probably reap some benefit from that.”
“Well there’s that too, I guess.”


Soon a dense forest came into view. It was thick with twenty-meter tall trees, creating an entirely different world from the open plains where we came from. It was probably a reforested area. The electromagnetic signal base should be inside this place.
Master Shizu stopped the buggy. He shouldered the bag containing the explosives. Another worry of mine is the tiny box containing the detonator, in regards to Ti. Why, of all places they decided to put it around my neck. That girl was made to carry the borrowed camera, water, food, and her coat among other things.
And thus, we ended up going to a picnic inside the forest, in such a bad weather, and carrying a bomb with us.
The forest was dark. As it was a place where people are not allowed to enter, there was no road. We used a compass, and earnestly proceeded to the west while stepping on grass and climbing past fallen trees.
After about an hour, we found several vehicles that were rusting away, from small cars to big trucks. The bodies of the vehicles were black from rust, and were buried in plants. And a little bit further, we found the place that we were aiming for.
“This must be the place…”
Master Shizu muttered in front of it. He set down the knapsack. Ti and I stood beside him and looked at the same scenery.
Inside this forest, a facility with an antenna stood. Indeed, it’s an electromagnetic signal base.
At least it was.
“There’s no need for us to go as far as using explosives.”
Just as Master Shizu said, the electromagnetic base has rotted away a long time ago.
The hundred-meter tall tower that probably housed the antenna has bent from its foundation, and has completely toppled over. The entire structure was rusted, and trees sprouted out in between the steel frames.
Beside the collapsed antenna were the traces of a building that perhaps served as the control center. It was a square building extending about twenty meters in all directions. It was perhaps once a building with four floors. Only its ruined framework and bits of its outer wall remained. When we tried to take a peek, we only found buried underneath blades of grass some fragments of machines of unknown purpose.
“We haven’t been told if there was more than one, so this must be it.”
“What are we going to do, Master Shizu? Shall we blow up this place?”
“That would be a waste of explosives.”
You bet. This place looked like an ancient ruin.
With the camera, Master Shizu took as much pictures as he can. This kind of camera instantly produces an image without having to develop a film. He took pictures of the entire structure, the building’s interior, the antenna’s appearance, and so on. To have an estimate of its size, he made Ti stand from place to place and took several pictures with her looking sourly.
“What do you think?” Master Shizu showed the pictures to Ti.
“…”
Ti mutely gazed at the pictures, took one and put it in her pocket.
“Well, I guess one’s good enough.”
After that, just to make sure, Master Shizu climbed a tall tree nearby, and confirmed if there wasn’t anything else around it. He surveyed the forest, but did not spot any similar facilities.


“Let’s go back.”
Master Shizu carried the knapsack with the explosives once more, and made our way back. After about an hour of crossing the forest, we got back to the buggy and rode once again underneath the gloomy skies.
“Perhaps the citizens should be relieved from now on,” Master Shizu said.


It was nearly evening when we returned to the police station.
Perhaps due to coordination with the government, other leaders in business suits were all there. In front of the building, the buggy was surrounded, and dozens of journalists with cameras and memos in hand appeared and took pictures one after another. Furthermore, people from the neighborhood who noticed the uproar, men and women of all ages, started to gather. Just as we thought, this has become quite a big deal.
Before everything else, Master Shizu returned the explosives and the detonator to the police.
And then, with everyone’s attention focused on him, he made his report to the chief and the men in business suits.
“Indeed, there was an electromagnetic signal base,” Master Shizu began.
“Oh. Then, what did you do about it?”
He handed out the bundle of pictures to the impatient leaders. The men stared at the photographs.
“But, it’s just as you see in these pictures.”
“So you blew it up after all? But there were lots of explosives left…,” the chief asked.
“No. We did not do anything. —From the rust on the machines, the collapsed trees, and the trees twisting their way through the gaps, you should be able to tell. That base has been destroyed for decades, and possibly, no longer functioning for a long time.”
The pictures fell from the hands of the men. Even the jouranlists surrounding us let out voices of astonishment.
“T-that can’t be!” One of the men wearing suits cried out, but in his hands were the pictures that he picked up. Once more, he looked at the photographs.
“That can’t be!”
He shouted the same words again. Master Shizu continued.
“And so, the people of this country were never ‘affected by the electromagnetic waves’ to begin with. Until now, those people you believed to have been victims of the electromagnetic waves were, unfortunately, acting out the crimes by their own volition.”
Master Shizu only stated the obvious, but the atmosphere around us changed considerably. The chief was dumbfounded, the men in suits were shaking, and the reporters even forgot to take pictures. Silence befell the onlookers.
“The electromagnetic base has never and will not affect you anymore, so everyone can rel—,” Master Shizu continued with a bright tone, but,
“Lies!”
He was interrupted by the chief’s yell.
“That is not possible! You’re saying that those extremely sorrowful crimes up until now, and even the one that occurred yesterday, were not because of the electromagnetic waves?! That’s not possible!”
One of the men in suits took over.
“That’s right! There’s no one in this country who would do such things on their own accord!”
Voices of agreement arose from the crowd. They came from the journalists, as well as from the onlookers.
“But the electromagnetic signal base was really in such a state,” Master Shizu explained with a worried look, and tried to gain acknowledgement. However,
“I know! These are all forged!” 
One of the men in suits proclaimed this with a straight face. The people around us quickly agreed. It seems that it was not questionable to them as to how we were able to fabricate the pictures.
“You…you must be affected by the electromagnetic waves!”
“Yes! That must be it! This man, dog and girl must have come too near the fully-functional base. This means that they were affected even though they were not citizens, and were influenced to come up with this deed! They faked the pictures to try and deceive us!”
I would have liked to ask them what we could possibly gain from doing such a crazy thing. But I knew the answer. It was all the electromagnetic wave’s fault.
Every single human here except for Master Shizu and Ti seemed to have taken this as a fact.
“It’s nothing like that. Please think about it once more,” Master Shizu said this, now looking a bit shocked. But like the water leaking from a cracked dam, the atmosphere would no longer return to normal.
“We can’t leave these fellows like this for long! Seize these people and animal! We have no choice but to send them immediately to the hospital for isolation!” the police chief announced.
The policemen who heard this order rushed out from the station. Master Shizu can’t possibly fight with the police forces inside the country. Without showing any sign of resistance,
“I am not being influenced,” he stubbornly and calmly proclaimed.
On the other hand, I could slip past the legs of the police and escape, but since Master Shizu would be left behind, it would be useless. I have no other choice. As Master Shizu slowly raised his hands, I stayed by his side without showing any resistance.
Only Ti differed.
In the blink of an eye, she vanished from behind me. When I turned my head to look for her, I saw her tiny form running past beyond the legs of the policemen.
Then she went to the buggy, and just when I was wondering what in the world she’s planning to do there, she grabbed her shoulder bag and started to run away. She nimbly sidestepped a surprised reporter and vanished.
I thought, if it’s Ti then she could get away without any problem. And just when I was thinking what she would do once she escaped,
“Aah! What are you doing?!”
Beyond the journalists, a terrible scream was heard from among the onlookers. It was the high-pitched scream of a young woman.
The policemen, the chief, the rest of the leaders, Master Shizu, and the media, turned to the direction of the scream.
“Stop it! Give it back!”
The shriek came from the same woman. And then, the rows reporters broke up.
And I saw Ti there.
“Ah…,” Master Shizu let out a sigh.
“You! What are you doing?!” the policemen cried out.
With the bag tied up around her, Ti held a baby with her left arm. It was a baby still suckling on a pacifier, a tiny infant. In her right hand, she was gripping a hand grenade. A grenade that greatly resembled a pineapple, a weapon that could kill or wound everyone in its surroundings by scattering shrapnel.
If one looked closely, its pin was already removed. Once Ti lets go of it, the lever that she was holding will come off, and it would not take four seconds for it to explode.  So that was the item she always carried in her bag.
If it explodes, Ti, the baby, the policemen and everyone nearby would probably be caught up in it. If it were me, I’d probably be okay as long as I crouch low enough, I thought. Wait, if it slips from Ti’s hand that would be bad. But no, that’s unlikely because she had lots of practice while using it for fishing.
“I will not let you get in our way.”
Those were Ti’s first words for the day.
“…”
The policemen fell silent and eventually tried to talk with the girl. ‘Hey, stop that,’ or ‘Calm down,’ or ‘Stop screwing with us,’ yet they all backed down. 
Ti lightly fixed her hold of the child in her left arm, and took one step closer. The policemen drew back.
*Sigh*
Master Shizu took a deep breath and called out. “Ti, you really shouldn’t be doing that kind of thing.”
“…”
Without responding, Ti briskly approached Master Shizu and I. The police drew back and eventually separated themselves from us.
“Look! That child has been influenced by the electromagnetic waves— She has gone mad!” the chief cried out.
“Whatever. Don’t get in our way.”
“…”
Nothing else followed Ti’s words.
Beyond the lines of the police who retreated,
“Give me back my son!”
The screams of the woman who was being restrained could be heard.
The freed Master Shizu approached Ti, slowly crouched down, and patted the head of the smiling baby. Then he looked back.
“Chief, it’s over for us. It seems like we could no longer preserve our will because of the effect of the electromagnetic waves.”
Because he said such a thing with a straight face,
Awooo!
Though I was loathe to do it, I gave out a howl like that of a stray dog. It was a mere act, but the chief and everybody else faltered.
“If we stayed here any longer, we don’t know what else we would end up doing. At the least, it must be something worse than what that man did yesterday!”
Awooo!
“That’s why we’re leaving. Please don’t stop us!”
Awooo! I wonder if that’s enough.
“Wait! While that may be true, you can’t keep that child hostage!”
“Then let’s have an exchange.”
Master Shizu readily answered and quickly approached the men. Then he grabbed the chief by the collar and dragged him away.
“Eh? Ah? Wait— Someone—”
While being watched by a lot of dumbstruck faces, the chief was dragged in front of Ti. Master Shizu skillfully loosened the chief’s necktie and used it to tie his wrists behind him. He pushed down the back of his knees with his foot, and made him kneel where he stood.
Master Shizu introduced the chief to Ti.
“Ti, this guy’s our new hostage, okay? If he doesn’t obey or if he struggled, drop the grenade inside his shirt. Then go around to his back. All right?”
Ti nodded deeply, “Then we no longer need this child.”
Master Shizu took the baby from Ti and held it up in his arms. Then he lifted it up in the air two or three times, making the baby laugh.
“I’m really sorry. Please send my apologies to your mother.”
While saying this, he handed the baby to one policeman.
Master Shizu settled in the driver’s seat of the buggy and turned on the engine. He slowly drove it beside the shivering and kneeling chief and Ti who was holding the grenade at his chest.
“Chief, I’ll drive until the walls. Please get in.”
“…”
When the chief only remained silent, Ti pressed the cold grenade beneath his chin, and let out one word.
“Get in.”
“Eek!”
After this shriek, the chief aimlessly stood up and settled on the passenger seat with his hands still tied behind him.
Ti rode on top of him so that they were facing each other. Her right hand that carried the grenade was still pressed in front of the chief’s neck, while she gripped the buggy’s pipe frame with her left hand. Lastly, I rode on top of the luggage beside the hood. It was by no means a comfortable spot, but I have no choice.
“Now everyone, we’ll be leaving. We’ll release the chief once we get out of the gates. Until then, we don’t know what we might end up doing because of the influence of the electromagnetic waves…so please be careful,” Master Shizu said this with a loud voice, and muttered, “Good grief.”
And he launched the buggy.


We asked the chief where the nearest gate is, and arrived at the southern gates in no time.
Perhaps they were contacted beforehand, as the gates were open, and the guards only timidly concealed themselves by the side as the buggy passed through the gates.
It was almost sundown. We came out of the now dark country, and rode just far enough so that we would not be targeted by persuaders, and then Master Shizu stopped the buggy.
“I’m sorry, Chief,” Master Shizu apologized to the chief who was now drenched in cold sweat, and asked Ti to give him the grenade. After handing it over,
“Where is the safety pin?”
“I threw it.”
Without any other choice, he tossed it far away. The lever came off in mid-air, and the grenade fell on the ground and exploded without restraint. It dug a hole in the ground.
The chief who got off the buggy sank on the ground where he stood when he heard the explosion. Master Shizu raised his sword and unfastened the chief’s necktie.
“You guys…,” the chief spoke, still seated. If I were to say it, he must be looking at Ti’s direction.
“Don’t you ever come to our country again. Don’t you ever come near it—you madmen— There is no place for people like you who have gone crazy in our country.”
It was the complete opposite of what the chief was trying to do before.
“I understand. We’ll do that…”
Master Shizu said with a somewhat forlorn face. He directed Ti to ride the buggy, and jumped in the buggy together with Ti.
Master Shizu settled on the driver’s seat and faced the chief.
“Just one last thing.”
“What is it?”
“About the electromagnetic signal base…”
“What about it?”
“In the pictures, it looked old and destroyed, but it was still working perfectly like new up to now. It sends out powerful electromagnetic waves. We weren’t affected by it, but all of you are in danger. That includes you and everyone else around you: your loved ones, even your enemies.”
“…”
The chief fell silent. And then,
“Hah! I knew it! We were right!” the chief said delightedly.
Master Shizu continued. “And the output power of the base is at its strongest. As early as tomorrow, its effects will reach the whole country. That includes you, your loved ones, and everybody else. Everyone will lose their minds. In an attempt to take over the country, I lied and told you that the base was destroyed. But I failed.”
“…”
The chief became speechless.
“Goodbye.”
These were the parting words Master Shizu left. Then he turned on the buggy’s engine.
“Let’s go, Ti, Riku. To wherever the next country is.”
“Yes.”
“Okay.”
Upon hearing our replies, he launched off the buggy.


The buggy ran through a prairie stained with a madder-red hue.
We had no chance to ask if there were any countries nearby. But since there’s a road, we should arrive somewhere.
As Master Shizu drove the buggy, Ti was, as usual, looking around tirelessly.
“I wonder how the chief understood your last words, Master Shizu? If nothing happens tomorrow, will they believe that the electromagnetic waves had no effect on them after all?” I asked Master Shizu. 
Master Shizu answered. “Who knows? —If only it could be conveyed as easily as electromagnetic waves.”
The buggy ran through a prairie stained with a madder-red hue.

54,v7c9,7,9,"“You don’t need to hold back! Eat some more! If this is not enough, I’ll order more right away. —I also traveled, so I know. During your travel in between countries, you barely eat anything, don’t you? You only consume those nutrient-rich, but tasteless portable rations, or fish sprinkled with salt, or boiled grass. I’m sure it has been a long time since you’ve eaten such a wonderful barbecue full-course meal, right?”
“Well yeah, that’s right… It has truly been a long time.”
“On the road, Kino kept on grumbling about food. She said she would eat a wonderful meal once she arrived in a country.”
“That’s why you should eat up as much as you want today. Keep me company until morning! It’s my treat! You don’t have to worry about anything, Kino.”
“Isn’t that great, Kino?”
“Of course, like I promised, I’ll also buy new oil, tires, chain, plugs, and all those other exhaust parts for Hermes! Leave it to me!”
“Thank you, miss. —Hey Kino, thank her too.”
“Thank you very much. Well, I’ll let you treat me then…but I have nothing to give you in return.”
“You only have to tell me various stories about your travels so far. Come on, let’s eat!”


“—So, that’s all I can tell you about the countries I came across east from here. But it doesn’t mean that I have seen everything from those countries… Was that helpful?”
“Yup, it was. Thanks. —Isn’t this meat delicious? Let’s order another plate. And some drinks too. In this restaurant, all you need is a push of a button to order something, and then it comes out immediately. —Here we go.”
“Sure…”
“Miss, you’re really rich, aren’t you?”
“Well that’s true. I’m a best-selling author, you know. Even now, my book is getting reprints, so money comes in even if I don’t do anything. Oh, here comes the meat. Eat up, eat up!”
“Oh, thanks. I’ll dig in. —But, was what you said before true? That you were originally a traveler like me?”
“Yes that’s right. —It has been more than a year since I came to this country. Before that, I stayed for about half a year in various countries that I visited.”
“You’re a genuine traveler, huh? Well, why?”
“Hmm, this country suited me for some reason. Ah, your question must be, ‘Why a traveler like me became an author in this country?’ eh?”
“Yes. Will you tell us?”
“The reason is simple. Because my book sells here. You must have seen the books being sold in the bookstores with my name and portrait on them, right?”
“We saw it. Piles of them.”
“I did. In fact, I read it after seeing the book in the hotel where it’s apparently being strongly recommended…”
“Why thanks. Well, how was it?”
“It was interesting…I enjoyed it very much. Everyone in the hotel also said that it was interesting.”
“Yeah? I’m so glad. I’m truly happy hearing the readers’ sincere feedbacks!”
“But…um, I don’t know if it’s okay to say this…”
“Hmm? No one’s listening, so it’s okay.”
“Don’t say it, Kino. This place is for parting.”
“…?”
“Could it be, that what Hermes wanted to say was ‘partying’?”
“Yeah, that’s it! So impressive, miss!”
“Hermes…”
“Well it doesn’t matter. Don’t say it, Kino.”
“Please do.”
“Then I’ll say it. —That story, I have read it before in another country. From what I remember, the author was not you.”
“Yeah. —And then?”
“Save for the name of the characters, the customs that do not exist in this country…and the language, it was completely identical.”
“Well, what were your thoughts about it, Kino?”
“Since you were a traveler, it is not totally impossible that you have published that book there with a different name in the past…but if I had to say, I don’t think that’s the case—”
“Please continue.”
“Okay. In the end, this is what I thought. —You have read and copied that book, and then you published it in this country as your ‘own novel’.”
“Excellent! Yes, you realized it! Correct! Spot on!”
“Eh?”
“Wha—?”
“Why are you so surprised? It’s just as you say, Kino.”
“Uh…”
“Is that okay? Confessing it just like that.”
“It’s fine! No one’s listening after all.”
“…”
“…”
“If the two of you leave tomorrow without saying anything, then that’s already settled.”
“Well, I suppose so.”
“What if we tell?”
“The bill for all of this food will be on  Kino. And the plans for Hermes’ refurbishment will be but a dream.”
“Don’t say anything, Kino. —Don’t say a word.”
“I’m not gonna tell, Hermes.”
“I thought so. That’s because you are travelers. I know that you won’t do anything that would put you in a disadvantage.”
“Then…just as I thought…”
“Indeed. Of my books, there’s not a single one that I have written on my own.”
“Not even one?”
“Not even one. —You see, initially, I escaped my country because I thought I would live my whole life in boredom until I die. But the tough diet during travels and the impoverished life inside countries were even worse! I couldn’t even celebrate after selling up the things I found on my travels. And that’s when it struck me.”
“Uh-huh?”
“After all, if you visit various countries, earning money from things that can be easily obtained in one country, but rare in another country is something any traveler knows, and does. But I thought, ‘Was there something out of these that I can reap the highest profit from?’”
“And that is…books?”
“Yes! For other objects, once you’ve sold one, that’s it. No matter how expensive it was. —But books are different. Even if it’s just one book, if it becomes popular, there will be earnings from reprints.”
“Indeed, you’ll reap a profit from that.”
“Isn’t it? I decided to do this kind of work. I read every book that I could lay my hands on from a certain country, piled up all the books I thought interesting on my horse, and headed to the next country. Over there I would look for a bookstore and find out what kind of book would sell. Then from my collection of books, I would choose one that is not known in that country—one that would sell—and copy everything.”
“And then you would send it to a publisher?”
“Yes, I would bring it in and say something like, ‘Please read it. It was something I wrote during my travels.’”
“I see, I see.”
“Of course, I didn’t expect everything to go well at the beginning. In the first place, a high quality translation is necessary for it to be published. In the end, I can only try one or two books. At first they wouldn’t sell, so I purchase books once more and head to the next country, and do the same thing.”
“Uh-huh.”
“And then?”
“Gradually, I learned ‘What story would sell in this country’, ‘What would appeal to most of the people in this country’, and so on. I studied them. —After that, it’s an easy victory! I would choose the best books from my collection and make my debut as an author! I’ll profit from the earnings and enjoy a lavish lifestyle. Once I got bored of a country, I would be sent off with tears from everyone and go to the next country. It’s such a wonderful life.”
“Have you been doing this for a long time?”
“Let’s see. It’s been about ten years, I suppose?” I already forgot. But—”
“But?”
“My everyday life is so much fun.”
“Must be. I bet it’s far from Kino’s life of poverty— Ouch!”
“It’s not that I’m criticizing you… But aren’t you deceiving the publishers and the readers with this?”
“It’s all right. Regardless of the kind of country you’re in, the readers are always being fooled. None of them realize that they’re being deceived. People who don’t think they’re being fooled are not being fooled at all. —More than that, everyone’s happy with reading such interesting books. I receive tons of fan letters saying ‘I was very impressed!’ or ‘It was such a wonderful book!’ or ‘I’m glad I’ve read this book!’ If it were not for me, they wouldn’t be able to read these books. I believe I’m doing everyone a favor.”
“I see… Well, what about the publisher? I think it’s quite clear that they are being made to publish a ‘plagiarized work’?”
“Ah, that’s also perfectly okay, that I can say for certain.”
“Why?”
“Of course I didn’t say a thing to them, and they wouldn’t say anything either, because—”
“Because?”
“Because?”


“Why obviously, it’s because they found out about my trick already.”














"
55,v7c10,7,10,"There was a dry river bed in a wilderness.
A big river flowed through the rough, rocky terrain. The river carved the ground; only its dry river bed blessed with vegetation. If viewed from the sky, one would probably see a green band amidst the brown.
On this dry river bed was a truck and a small, battered car creating long shadows upon being illuminated by the sun that was beginning to set.
And the owners of these vehicles surrounded a bonfire.
First there was a trader who owned the truck—a rather plump, middle-aged man. Then there was his wife. And standing behind the two, wearing hand persuaders (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) on their waists, were four male bodyguards.
Facing the trader was a young, black-haired woman wearing a large-caliber revolver on her hip. Seated next to her was a rather short, but handsome man.
An iron grill was placed in the bonfire. On top of it, a big chunk of meat was being grilled appetizingly.
The trader spoke cheerfully, “Now, travelers. It must be fate for us to meet in a place like this. Please help yourselves.” The trader was as bountiful as he appeared. “I feel generous because I just returned from a successful trade,” he said.
“Wow, it looks so delicious.” Saying this, the man beside the black-haired woman slightly lifted his thumb in a way that only the woman would see.
‘What do you think? Should we attack them?’ was the general meaning of his signal, but the woman slightly touched the nail of her ring finger in reply, ‘They have four bodyguards, so let’s lay low for today.’ The man nodded. The two thanked the trader for the meal, and the little dinner party began pleasantly.
The trader sent for liquor in a ceramic pot, and offered it to the two. But the pair only thanked him and declined.
“Oh? So it’s true that travelers don’t drink much, eh? Well, I suppose it would be tough to move around if you’re carrying liquor.” Saying so, the trader gulped down his alcohol heartily.


The meal eventually progressed along with the sundown.
“I’m jealous of you, totally free to travel as you please! Gahahahahaha—”
The trader’s drunkenness has also progressed just as much. His face was already red, and he was being loud, but both his wife and his bodyguards only looked on as if it was natural.
“But for you to be traveling at that age, there must be some big reason, huh?! Could you possibly be ×××××?” the trader said to the black-haired woman. Instead of the woman, it was the man next to her who stiffened from the remark.
“Well, it doesn’t mean that ××××× is a bad thing! But a ××××× is a ××××× after all!”
The woman, staying cool all throughout, only warded off the man’s remarks with yes’s and maybe’s.
“Master…hold back,” the man muttered with a small voice, heart going pit-a-pat in anticipation of the woman’s angry outburst.
The completely drunk trader was being unmindful, gulping down some more liquor.
“Gahahahaha! Well, ×××××! You must be really ×××××! How wonderful! By the way, I wonder if a ××××× is really ×××××?” he said. And with a loud voice that would probably reach a far-away country, but perhaps unintentionally, he repeated the rude words over and over.
The man’s monologue continued. Even so, the black-haired woman casually eluded his taunts, and just when the man was becoming impressed with the strength of the woman’s tolerance level,
“I’m really sorry,” the trader’s wife, who had been quiet from the start, began to speak. Her words were that of an apology, but her tone had no hint of remorse in it at all. It was merely an excuse to start a conversation. The wife continued, “He would have been a good person if only he didn’t drink alcohol.”
“I see,” the woman lifted her head. She confirmed the bodyguards’ location in one glance. Then she extracted the revolver from her right hip.
Neither giving the man next to her the time to react nor giving the four bodyguards a chance to notice, four shots echoed in the wilderness.
All the bullets hit the persuaders on the bodyguard’s hips, rendering them useless. Before the dumbfounded group, the woman aimed at the forehead of the trader.
“Now then, won’t you hand over your valuables to us?” she said with a sweet smile.


Amidst the pale darkness of the twilight, the bodyguards were sitting with their hands tied behind them while the trembling wife was tied behind her husband, who was already sober and whose face was now deep red in anger.
“W-w-what a thing to do! You ingrates!”
“We won’t take everything. Maybe about thirty percent,” the black-haired woman said while transferring jewels and gold coins in a bag.
“…”
The man beside her, who was prudently keeping watch with his .22 caliber automatic persuader, remained silent.
“Those are my earnings!” the trader protested.
“And now they’re mine,” the woman quickly answered. When she has finished transferring the jewels, she placed what was left in front of the trader.
And then she instructed the man to let out air from the tires of the truck so that they would not be able to chase after them. So that the tires could still be used when filled with air, he only removed the valve and let all of the air inside escape.
“Well, goodbye. The dinner was delicious.”
The woman started the car’s engine and called the man.
“What kind of woman would do this?! This is preposterous!” The trader let loose his anger, and the man spoke to him as he left,
“I’m really sorry. She would have been a good person if only she couldn’t fire a persuader…”

Something fun happened at school today.
A traveler came to our school. A traveler is a person from another country who is on a journey.
The traveler came to our country the day before. This person met our headmaster by chance, and was invited to come to our school.
When the traveler entered our classroom, we were so surprised. It was because the traveler was still very young, and looks around fifteen years old like my cousin.
At first we thought the traveler was a boy, so we were very surprised when we learned that she was actually an ‘older sister’.
Her name was Kino. She said she goes on a journey with a motorrad, but she can’t take him with her to the classroom.
What impressed me the most is that Miss Kino goes on a journey by herself.
I heard that that there was nobody in between countries. And that it was very dangerous to travel in those places on your own. Miss Kino also told us, ‘There are dangers. You have to get by on your own somehow.’
I thought that I was able to live because I am together with my mother and father in this country.
And so the important thing that I learned is to become fine adults someday and help people in trouble.

A traveler came to our school. I was so excited.
The traveler wore a cool persuader on her hip. It looked large and heavy. It was deep black and it seemed like a powerful persuader.
For sure, the traveler beats down the bad guys using it. She takes it with her on her journey because traveling is dangerous, obviously.
However, the traveler was so selfish. When I asked her to show me her persuader, she refused and told me that it was dangerous. She didn’t let me take a look at it at all.
I know a lot about persuaders from watching movies. I am very good in aiming my toy persuader, ‘Super Boom Z’, you know.
Even though there are twenty in our class, I am the best. And so, to be told something like ‘It’s dangerous’ is just not right. ‘It’s wrong,’ I thought.
Mother said that it was wrong to be selfish, and often helped distribute bread in the church. I do that too.
If you become selfish when you travel, then I think you shouldn’t go on a journey.

It took me a long time to eat my breakfast.
There was a surprise at school. A traveler came to observe. A traveler is a person who does not live in a country, and goes on a journey.
Her name is Kino. She was a short-haired person.
On my previous birthday, I told my mother that I wanted to have short hair. My mother told me that girls should have long hair.
I saw that Miss Kino had short hair. I don’t understand why I can’t have short hair.
When I went home I told them. Mother told me that if a girl didn’t have long hair, she couldn’t marry. She also told me that because I’m still a child, I couldn’t marry yet.
Then my mother stroked my hair.
“If your hair is long, it can be tied in many different ways,” Mother said. I think that was the real reason.
But I thought it was unfair that Miss Kino can have short hair. At that time, my father went home from work.
“Long hair is cute, you see,” Father said. But I prefer to be cool rather than cute.
Our dinner was gratin. I blew on it because it was hot.


“Now, everyone. That was three diaries for yesterday’s ‘Diary Writing Activity’. Three of you wrote about a traveler coming to class. Your teacher is really happy. —Now then, I will announce which among these diaries is suited for the ‘community diary’. For today, teacher has chosen Emily’s diary. Everyone, please clap your hands for Emily. —Okay, now everyone. Emily’s diary will be copied and distributed, so please paste it on top of your diaries. Paste it well so that it won’t come off.”
“Teacher!”
“Yes. What is it, Gene?”
“I don’t want to paste somebody else’s diary on mine!”
“What’s that all of a sudden? Everyone in class should be friends. You have to have the same memories as your friends.”
“B-but, I thought so hard about mine! Aren’t we supposed to write how we felt about that person…um, about what happened on that day in our diaries? That’s what you told us, teacher!”
“I did tell you that. That’s not wrong. That’s why everyone in class should leave in their diaries the best memory of all. So that when you read it when you’re adults, you can recall the event, and have fond moments with everyone. It is important to share the same memories with everyone. Why can’t you understand that?”
“T-then! Can’t I have my own memories?! How a person felt about in the past, there’s no way that would change!”
“… Everyone, in this class, there’s a child who doesn’t listen to teacher. A very, very bad child. It’s a wicked child who insist on his foolish thoughts. Who is it? —Yes, it’s Gene. Gene, you are a very bad child. Everyone, don’t become foolish like Gene. —Gene, stand in the corridor. And please go to the staff room later.”

Today is a school holiday, so I cleaned up Grandpa’s mementos together with Grandma. Grandma told me, ‘Thank you for helping.’
There was a diary that Grandpa wrote when he was just a child. He wrote a lot of things.
Among them, Grandpa wrote about the day that a traveler came to their school.
Grandpa was so impressed with the traveler. He wrote, ‘She’s great because she was doing her best on her own. That’s why I also want to help people.’ He must be very impressed with this person.
Grandpa was such a good person. Grandma said ‘Yes.’
I also want to become like Grandpa.
But Grandpa would sometimes use ‘watashi’ and sometimes ‘boku’[2]. Sometimes his handwriting would be neat, and at times, dirty. It’s very strange.
The end.















"
57,v8c1,8,1,"A car was running on a forest road.
It was a small, yellow, car in a condition so bad that it looked as if it’s going to self-destruct at any moment. It rumbled and proceeded shakily on the road as white smoke sputtered from its exhaust pipe.
It was a vast land overrun with dense forests over flat terrain. The sun shone radiantly above the eastern horizon. A variety of birds were singing; it was a cool morning in early summer.
Two people were riding in the car. On the right-hand driver’s seat was a rather short but handsome young man with his hands on the wheel, while a young woman with long, black hair was seated in the passenger seat at the left side. Meanwhile, the narrow back seat was packed with dirty luggage and bags.
“Master,” the man spoke while driving. As the road was not in its best condition, he adjusted the steering wheel from time to time.
“What is it?” answered the woman called Master.
“We’ll soon be arriving in the next country, so—”
The man proposed that they sell the gem that they have in the next country and exchange it for food, fuel, and gold dust. The woman contemplated for a while.
“I guess we have no choice, but—”
“We should sell it at the highest possible price. I know.”
Just ahead the car, the top of the walls came into view.


It was not too big of a country, but it seemed rich.
The first thing they beheld upon entry was the vast expanse of fields. After running for a while, they reached the country’s center that was lined up with stone apartments. The wide, streetlight-lined roads were dense with shops on both sides. It was a rather splendid townscape.
“This country looks great, doesn’t it? Its population is comparatively small, and its technology is pretty advanced. This is the sort of place where we could sell at a high price,” said the man in the driver’s seat of the tiny car.
This car was the dirtiest among the numerous vehicles running on the street. They were laughed at as a luxury car overtook them.
“What you said about the selling part is true; however…there are too many policemen in this city.”
The man agreed to the woman’s observation. There were lots of people walking around the city in the morning, but there were as many policemen, who looked like soldiers with their green uniforms.
“The immigration procedures took awfully long. That guard must also be an MP,” the man said. In this case, ‘military police’ refers to a system that combines the army and the police.
“Based on my experience, you cannot let your guard down in countries like this.” 
The man cast a sideways glance to the woman, and then asked, “Because of the bad public order?”
“No. —It’s the authorities we should be wary of. Let’s lay low in this country.”
“… Roger.”
The car stopped in front of a cheap-looking hotel.


“Well then, I’m going to cash out.”
The man said from the cramped room of the hotel. He wore a square-barreled hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) on his left hip, but it was hidden by the thin, brown jacket that he wore. He put the tiny bag that contained the gem inside his breast pocket.
“Please come back as soon as possible. There’s no need for us to stay long here. Let’s depart by evening.”
“I understand. I’ll be back by noon. Meanwhile, you go and have a relaxing shower, Master,” the man said as he left. 
But noon has come and gone, yet the man did not return.


This is what happened to the man.
He showed the gem to a jeweler in the crowded shopping district. The shopkeeper’s momentary surprise was replaced with a broad smile. Then he disappeared to the back of the shop and came back, proposing a price that surprised the man. The man readily agreed, imagining the woman’s pleased face, and left the store with a grin. However,
“You there, wait.”
The moment he came out to the streets, he was surrounded by four policemen.
“You are suspected of possession of illegal drugs,” one of the cops said.
“Huh?”
Another policeman acted as if he was taking out his hand from the man’s pocket. And then he exposed a small bag that he was holding.
“Look we’ve caught you red-handed. We are arresting you for possession of illegal drugs.”
For a moment, the man considered pulling out his persuader and shooting to death all of the policemen—it wouldn’t take him two seconds—but,
“…”
He stopped after giving it a second thought.
The man was handcuffed and his persuader and personal belongings were confiscated. As he was about to ride the police car, he saw the shopkeeper of the jewelry store pass money to the police. The man let out a small curse and pondered how, even at this state, he could beat down all of the police, steal the car, and lunge it into the jewelry store while he’s at it. But,
“…”
He stopped after giving it a second thought.


“In short, your lover was arrested. In this country, illegal possession of drugs is a serious crime. It will be decided by the court from here on, but ten years in jail should be a fair estimate.”
“I see. But I’d like to correct one thing. He is not my ‘lover’, he’s just a travel companion,” said the woman, who was in a room inside a large building at the country’s center—an enormous and grandiose building octagonal in shape, built along with the spacious lawn that surrounded it.
A splendid clock tower stood at the center of the building, with a huge clock attached on each of the four sides facing east, west, south and north. The observation platform in its rooftop is higher than any building in the country, offering a 360-degree view of its surroundings.
It was in this room where the woman was seated in front of a desk, opposite a middle-aged police officer dressed in a uniform with important-looking decorations and embroidery while reclining comfortably in his seat. Several policemen stood around him. The outdoor scenery was visible from the gaps of the blinds, presenting a rather beautiful view of the sun setting to the west.
“Where is he right now?” the woman asked, and the middle-aged police officer answered that he was in an underground detention facility.
The woman took the opportunity to ask about the building. She was told that it was a historic structure that once served as a royal palace. But as the land was no longer ruled by a king, it was now used by various government offices. The clock tower was apparently a protected cultural site.
“It is the police who have the administrative rights to this building. In fact, this place is the police headquarters. I don’t think other countries have headquarters as luxurious as this,” the middle-aged policeman said proudly, and laughed.
“I see. That means it is the corrupt police who holds absolute political power, and use their authority to do as they please. Just as I thought.”
The woman did not say these words, which accurately point out the situation. Instead, “I understand the circumstances, but as you can see, we are travelers. With your excellency’s influence, it’s not at all impossible to arrange for his deportation, is it not?”
“Hmm. How much are you willing to pay?”
“About this much,” was the woman’s reply to the middle-aged police officer’s frank question, indicating a figure she wrote on a piece of paper. No one knew whether the amount was really all that she could give.
The middle-aged police officer leaned forward and peeked at the piece of paper.
“That won’t do. It’s not even worth discussing.” He leaned back to his chair once more with a shake of the head, and continued, “You’d better leave the country immediately. I’ll keep quiet about the offer you made here with us.”
The woman replied with her imperturbable expression and tone, “I’ll do just that. To begin with, he’s just some person I got acquainted to during my travels. I really don’t know anything about him, and it can’t be helped if he was caught doing something bad. I’ll leave him behind.”
“That’s a wise decision.”
“Just one last thing. Can I bid him farewell?”
“We can’t allow that since he has committed a serious crime.”
“About this matter, I would be very grateful for any assistance you can lend me,” she said while slowly taking out a single gold coin from her bosom. She placed it on top of the desk, covering the piece of paper she wrote on earlier. Seeing this, the police officer’s face relaxed.
“Hmm… But since you are a traveler, I’ll make an exception and allow you to talk with the criminal for a short time.”


The middle-aged police officer and the woman, together with an entourage of policemen, went out of the room and made their way down a corridor.
“…”
Along the way, the woman looked left and right with only her eyes, checking the tags stuck in front of the rooms. The policemen around her took no notice at all.
Eventually, the party went down to the basement using an elevator, and passed through the gates of the entrance to the detention facility, which was protected by policemen.
They proceeded on a hall lined with jails on both sides. Drab rooms with only beds, toilets, and water closets continued on.
And, in one of the rooms, there was a person—a handsome, but slightly short man—sitting on the bed. He raised his face as he heard the sound of footsteps. When he recognized the face of the woman surrounded by the police,
“Ah, Sis! You came here to have me released, right?” He said happily, gripping the cage. But the woman replied mercilessly,
“You were found guilty of doing such a terrible thing, you know.”
“Eh…”
“I even told you stay clear of unlawful activities.”
“No way… I was framed!”
“I hate causing trouble for other people. You know that, right? —Please face your trial here. There are countries I have to visit, so I can’t wait for you.”
“No way…” The man still gripped the cage and looked down helplessly. “Even if…I have lived my life so far without doing a single bad thing…”
“Then reflect on your crime here,” said the woman. The policemen around her looked at each other and laughed.
The man spoke feebly. “Sis, there’s something in my bag that I haven’t shown you yet. Sell it in the next country to add to your traveling expenses. I have no use for it anymore. But please sell it for a high price because it’s worth 434 silver coins when I bought it. You can also have the things I took with me this morning. Do as you like with them.”
“I understand. I’ll do that,” the woman answered, and the man went back to his bed, still crestfallen. And then he collapsed face-down on the bed, curling up his body.
“Surely that’s enough.”
“Yes.”
As commanded by the middle-aged police officer, the woman walked to the exit from the man’s jail.
She came back to the entrance of the detention facility and asked the police clerk about the man’s belongings.  He took out the man’s persuader, holster, belt, knapsack, and a tiny bag.
“What about the gem and cash he had?”
“Oh, those are possible funds coming from illegal drug trade, and were all confiscated as evidence,” explained the middle-aged officer.
“I see,” was the woman’s only reply, and put the man’s belongings in the knapsack.
“Now, everyone, I’ll be taking my leave.” 
And she left the building.


Upon returning to the hotel room, the woman relaxed for a bit, and then firmly closed the blinds.
Then, she opened the man’s luggage, a big backpack. At its bottom, there was a very sturdy plastic case that was about as big and thick as an encyclopedia.  It looked like it can be used for beating people to death.
On one side of the case was a numeric keypad.
“…”
The woman keyed in 4-3-4 and the case opened smoothly. The inside was lined with a thick cushion cut out in several places, with a variety of contraptions neatly fitted in each.
“… Good grief. I wonder what that man did in the past. Well, let’s put these to use.”
The woman closed the case with a click.
“First is shopping. And then let’s get out of this country,” she muttered to herself.


The setting sun dyed the observation platform in the police headquarters in a yellow color.
The sound of a bell echoed from the lofty clock tower. 
A police messenger came to the middle-aged police officer who was reclining on his chair.
“The woman earlier just left the country in a car. She only bought portable rations and traveling equipment. There was nothing suspicious with her actions.”
“I see… I thought she was dangerous, but she was just a fool after all. Don’t let her re-enter the country.  Things might get troublesome.”
“Yes sir. By the way, there’s a message from the director who was attending a dinner party with politicians: ‘Good job. We’ll send your share later.’”
“Hmm. You also did very well.”
“Thank you very much. —What are we going to do about that man?”
“He could have been deported just fine, but punishing him with twenty years of hard labor is not a bad idea. We can decide later on.”


Night. It was quiet in the forest.
The stars twinkled in the clear, moonless sky.
The woman’s shabby, yellow car was parked in a forest a bit ways off the country.
The woman was sitting beside it, making rummaging sounds as she worked on something.
“Now then,” she said as she stood up.  The scruff of her jacket was tightly closed, and she wore gloves and a knit cap. She was garbed in a single color—black. The holster of her favorite high-caliber revolver hung from her right hip, and she carried a knapsack on her back. Lastly,
“I see…what an interesting device.”
Over her left eye, there was a strange cylinder that looked like a short and stout scope. A band wrapped around her head held it in place.
The woman gazed at the forest scenery through her left eye. The branches of trees swaying from the wind, as well as the moving animals, were amplified by the device. It created a world covered in a suspicious shade of green.
“‘Night-vision equipment’, is it? Fascinating,” the woman murmured to herself.
This set of night-vision equipment was one of the items stowed inside the man’s precious case. Other than this, there was the man’s persuader silencer that was especially made for assassination, for-assassin-use plastic knives that can pass through metal-detectors, for-assassin-use wires that can be used to strangle someone from behind, for-assassin-use capsules containing poison that can pass off death as a heart attack, for-assassin-use stabbing pen with a poison-laced tip, and so on. It was an arsenal for various assassination tools.
The woman traversed the forest without making any sound. Later that night, she arrived at the walls of the country she just left. Its tall, black walls soared towards the sky.
After confirming that there were no guards nearby, the woman pulled out the revolver from her waist. She disassembled the front half of the revolver and removed the barrel.  She took out a different barrel from her knapsack.
It was a strange device. A thick, metal jar was inserted at the tip of the barrel, and was securely fixed with a wire. The bottom of the bottle has been hollowed out. 
The woman attached this to the revolver’s body, and snapped open the hammer with her thumb.  She pulled down the loading rod under the barrel, gripped firmly with her left hand, and aimed the bottom of the jar towards the top of the walls.
The woman fixed her aim, and pulled the trigger.
Thump.
There was a muffled shot, followed by a forceful quiver from the revolver’s recoil. An iron claw, a three-hooked metal not unlike a ship’s anchor, came out of the jar. The thin wire tied to the claw, which has been coiled inside the bottle, unwound as it came out.
The faint sound of the claws hitting and catching the top of the walls was heard. The woman returned the revolver to its original form and put it back in its holster.
She put on thick leather gloves and pulled the wire at different angles to make sure that it was stuck firmly.
“Here we go.”
The woman began climbing the wall.


While the woman climbed the dark walls without making a sound, 
*Yawn*
Inside the dimly lit detention cell, the man turned face-up and began to yawn and stretch.
“It’ll probably take a bit more time. Maybe I should sleep.”
He rolled over, and slept.


Even though it was almost midnight, the shops in the country’s entertainment district were still crowded. Drunken customers happily come and go.
In one corner of the street, a policeman stood guard by himself with his back on the dark alley. The young man gazed at the street with a bored expression, tapping his palm with the baton in his other hand.
Two dark arms stretched from the darkness of the back alley. One arm closed in on the guard’s mouth, and the other one wrapped around his neck. The arms returned to the darkness without a sound.
No one noticed that one policeman disappeared from the street.


It was well past midnight.
The lively entertainment district has subsided, and only a few drunks were lying about on the quiet street,
Pop!
It was like the sound of escaping air, but much louder. The noise swiftly resonated.
“Heh?”
A nearby drunk opened his half-closed eyes. What was reflected in his eyes was a cloud of smoke rising from a trash can that has started to burn.
“A-ah…”
He stood up as he muttered, and recklessly held out his hands towards its warmth. At that moment,
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-popop!
Successive explosions were heard in every corner of the street.
“Huh?”
The man’s wide-open eyes reflected the bright light of the burning trash cans.


Police cars and fire trucks rushed in with bellowing sirens.
When he heard these sounds, the man in the detention facility opened his eyes. He sat on top of the bed, stretched, and let out a big yawn.
Amidst the nonstop blaring of the sirens, he could make out the distant clatter of running footsteps from the building’s upper floors.
With such noise as his backdrop, the man used the toilet, washed his hands and face, and began to exercise.
“Zero-one-two, three-four. Five-six, seven-eight.”
He moved his body gently, relaxing his muscles, and ended his exercise with a deep breath.
“Here goes…”
The man gripped the cage, and shouted in a voice loud enough to be heard through all the clamor.
“Hey, guard! What’s with the commotion? It’s so annoying I couldn’t sleep!”
“Quiet! It’s none of your business so shut your trap!” the guard yelled back from the entrance of the detention facility.
“Eh, but this commotion is not normal is it? Something big must be happening, right?”
“Shut up! There was no contact from above, and I was about to go and ask!”
“Is that so? You’re such a hard worker. If you find out, kindly tell me—”
“Shut up! —Ugh!”
“Huh? What’s the matter —?”
No answer came from the guard, who only let out an unpleasant scream.
Instead, another policeman came walking down the corridor and stopped in front of the man’s jail.
“I knew you’d come for me, Master. —I’m sorry for letting down my guard.”
“Good grief, you’re really an apprentice I had to look after.”
The one wearing the police uniform was the woman called Master. She wore the uniform tightly over her other clothes, and hid her long hair underneath the uniform cap. At first glance, she looked like a refined young man.
The woman quickly opened the man’s jail with a key, and tossed him the knapsack she was carrying.
“Inside is your persuader, as well as a set of uniform. Change your clothes.”
The man took the sack and started to change. Meanwhile, he asked, “Where my ‘toys’ helpful?”
“Well, in a way. —We’ll leave this place once you’re finished changing.”
“What are we going to do?”
The man stuffed the clothes he has taken off into the knapsack once he has finished changing into the police uniform.
“We’ll walk into the building from here.”
“Eh? Shouldn’t we escape right away?”
“Right now it would be impossible to get out the country. The gates will definitely be closed, and the security will be tight. It’s unreasonable to break through the gates with just the two of us. Eventually, people will come here as well.”
“That’s true, but…what should we do?” the man asked.
“What would you do?” The woman returned the question. The man’s eyes registered an unusually serious expression.
“Let’s see… I’ll hide at once in a place where I can’t be found, for instance, in the attics or in the sewers. The search party will be tired by the third day or so, and by that time, I’ll immediately leave the country secretly, or by force, if necessary.”
“That makes sense, but not quite correct.”
“Oh?” The man had a rather disappointed look on his face.
The woman revealed the answer with an amused smile, “Waiting it out for three days before leaving is correct. However, hiding is not.”
“Then what is?”
“We’ll go on a rampage. First let’s go to the third floor, where there’s food and weapons. You’ve had plenty of rest while in jail, right? If you don’t want to get rusty, you should do some serious fighting once in a while. Also, the scenery from a high place is quite breath-taking.”
“… Ah!”
A gleeful expression crept on the man’s face as he gradually comprehended, then he laughed fiercely.


“Then, what happened to the two after that, Kino?”
A motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) asked.
The motorrad was loaded with plenty of luggage on both sides and on top of its rear wheel. It was running leisurely on a road inside a forest, with the autumn foliage fluttering around it.
“Yup. After that—” The motorrad’s driver called Kino answered. She was wearing a brown coat, the excess hem of which was rolled up to her thighs. Goggles were strapped on her face, and she had on a brimmed hat with flaps covering her ears. She was considerably young, around her mid-teens.
The autumn sky was clear and not a single cloud can be seen. The bright sun announced the time of the day.
Kino answered the question while letting the motorrad run slowly. “Aside from the streets, Master also planted explosives and incendiary bombs in police cars and power stations. As a result, the headquarters was in chaos, and they could walk to the arsenal in their disguise without being discovered. Most of the police force was dispatched due to all the commotion Master caused. When they went into the arsenal and ransacked it for persuaders, not a single one found them suspicious, as they were dressed in police uniforms, and they stunned a few who stopped by the arsenal. Then they filled up a trolley with sniping rifles, small rapid-fire persuaders, ammos, and all sorts of explosives.”
“Whoa, scary. —It’s just like ‘dancing the mambo’, huh?”
“That’s right, Hermes,” Kino agreed so easily that the motorrad called Hermes fell silent for a while. Then he pulled himself together, “—Um, please continue Master’s story.”
“Ok. After they took all the weapons they could carry, the two headed next to the food storage, and loaded another trolley with portable rations and drinking water. Because what they were doing then was so suspicious, they had to knock three policemen in a nearby room unconscious.”
“And then, and then?”
“And then, they let out a rumor that bombs were planted inside the building. They activated the alarm and threw flares here and there. Everyone in the building scurried out. After that, they boarded the elevator to the top floor, carrying the two trolleys with them.”
“The top floor? They didn’t escape? I was certain that they would escape by mixing in with the fleeing crowd.”
“It’s completely the opposite. Master and her apprentice encamped with their luggage in the rooftop of the clock tower, which, though not wide, was the highest place in the whole country. They blew off the cable of the lone elevator leading there, and let it fall all the way to the basement.”
“Ka-bam!”
“It was almost dawn. They took aim at the people who evacuated outside, as well as at the exhausted policemen who were just coming back after the commotion has finally settled down, and—”
“Bang?”
“Yes. From the top of the tower, they fired at every single person outside using their sniper rifles. They shot the tires of the cars so that they wouldn’t move, and picked off the people who fled the cars one after the other. From such a high position, they had a perfect view of the people running across the wide-open square. There was no way out,” Kino said indifferently. 
“Scary!” Hermes exclaimed. “So they killed every single one of them?” Hermes asked, but Kino only shook her head as she drove.
“Wrong. That’s what amazing about Master. She did not kill a single one.”
“Huh? What do you mean?”
“It was deliberate. She intentionally avoided their heads or chests, and aimed at their legs. Thick blood vessels run through the thighs, so she did not target them, either. She only aimed at the non-fatal spots on the knees or shins, and accurately hit them with her rifle.”
“Ah, so that they can shoot down the ones that would come to the aid of the wounded moaning for help, right? Just like any good sniper.”
“That’s wrong too.”
“Oh?”
“The two of them shot neither the people crawling to escape nor the ones who were helping.”
“Why? How come?”
“I also asked her the same question. Master gave me some time to think about it, but I only learned the answer when she continued her story.”
“Then I give up. Continue the story, Kino.”
“Okay. It is connected to the reason why they climbed the clock tower instead of escaping. Master knew full well that they couldn’t possibly break through the gates with just the two of them.”
“Well, that’s because there would be a lot of people positioned there to securely protect it and make sure that no one will escape.”
“That’s why they decided to wait until the citizens begged them, ‘We will open the gates, so please pass through.’”
“Ah, I see. It was a siege, wasn’t it? I finally get it!” Hermes exclaimed in glee, and Kino gave a small nod.
“Yes. They barricaded themselves at the top of the clock tower, and sniped anyone who comes near. This way, the building can no longer be used, and the everyday work of the people was interrupted to a great extent. The police tried to get in one way or the other. But—”
“They were being shot.”
“Yep. To them, being shot in the leg is worse than getting killed. If instead, they see their comrades getting shot cruelly to death, it will fire up their desire for vengeance, and their fighting spirit will rise. But when they see their companions getting shot, screaming in pain, they start to have such thoughts as ‘What if I’m the next one?’, and hesitate. Humans whose jobs revolve around fighting are far more terrified of being in pain than being killed on the spot. In any case, their morale is down.”
“That makes sense.”
“Even so, the police tried to do their best in front of everyone. They used armored trucks and tried to break into the building on both sides.”
“But to no avail.”
“Master thought so too, and it seemed that her student, who was framed and jailed, got fired up. He could snipe through the eye of a needle and still wouldn’t miss. All the troops that broke through were sent to the hospital, and it took lots of ambulances to accommodate the wounded. Once everything settled by noon, they dropped a letter in a sealed envelope. Of course, they used police equipment.”
“What was written in it? Something like, ‘If you don’t want any more casualties, let us leave right away!’?”
“Nope. They didn’t write something so blatantly threatening. It was more like this:

Dear Sirs,
The wind hints of the approaching summer, but we are glad to see that everyone in the police force is becoming more spirited by the hour.  Well, we two scoundrels decided to turn this place into a graveyard, and so until our bows break or until we run out of arrows, we will defend this place to the last of our strength, and we intend to rampage to our heart’s content. For the two of us are unskilled, we request that you grant us your guidance and encouragement.
Yours Truly
P.S. We set up loads of bombs on the stairs up the clock tower, so if you don’t want to lose this historic building, kindly refrain from using the stairs.

When Kino finished speaking, only the sound of Hermes’ well-maintained engine could be heard in the forest.
Eventually, Hermes whispered, “Scary.”
“Yup, scary. —At that time, they had no idea what was going on in the heads of the policemen, but at that moment, they must be considering that it would be better to let the two escape.”
“Scary.”
“Yup, scary. —And of course, the commotion has already made it into the news, and the situation was made public. It was even broadcasted live on radio.”
“That is so stupid.”
“Yes. Master thought so too. The two of them were also listening to the radio, so they were saved because they learned every move of the police. At any rate, the day soon turned to night, and the police tried several times to approach stealthily.  However, Master’s student had a night-vision device attached to his rifle, and so they were beaten at their own game. The two of them slept in shifts, and remained in their positions even while eating and drinking.”
“Well, how long did they keep it up?” Hermes asked.
“Three days and three nights,” Kino answered, and explained. “The situation was—

[Ehem, you two over there, can you hear me?! You bastards can’t escape! As you wish, that place will be your grave! If by any chance you don’t die there, you will be hanged after being paraded in the city! You’d better prepare yourselves!]
Zing.
[You guys are completely surrounded! So surrender like real men! If you surrender obediently, we’ll spare your lives!]
Ping.
[Is there anything you want to say? Can’t you see we’re being generous by even trying to hear your side?!]
Zping.
[Sirs, our side is willing to negotiate. It’s not a bad deal, you know.]
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat.
[Uh, how are you doing? We would like to ask for a cease-fire to be able to talk, and agree on terms for our mutual survival. What do you think?]
Brat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat.
[Good morning. There is something we would like to tell you. If you wish to leave the country, we will gladly allow it.]
Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang.
[We are begging your excellencies. Please pacify your anger, and leave our country.] [2]
Bam. Bang. Boom.
[We beg you. From the bottom of our hearts, please stop this. Please—]
Zping-rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-brat-tat-tat-tat-ba-ba-ba-bang-pew-pew-ping.
[Save me! Please stop already!]
“Now that you mention it, it would be better for us to leave the country quietly than to die here.”
[R-really?]
“Well, how much are you willing to pay?”
[…]
“How much are you willing to pay?”
[… Um, will the amount I write down here do?]
Zing.
[We’ll give more!]

—Well, something like that.”
“Demons.”
“At any rate, rather than prolonging the situation and letting the number of casualties increase, they realized that there will be less damage if they just ‘deport’ them. Master and her student ripped off the government’s money, took the police commissioner who brought it to them hostage, and made him drive the escape car up to the gates.”
“And they all lived happily ever after. The end. Wow, what a great story. —Ah, I see it.”
Just ahead of the forest where Kino and Hermes was riding in, the top of the walls became visible.
“Just in time. So, in that country, we will keep it a secret how I obtained ‘Canon’. We will go ‘shopping’ in the flea market. And of course, never ever talk about Master’s story.”
“Roger.”
“However, since we’re in this country, I want to know what remained of that story.”
“It must have been a historical event, right?”
“Unless, what Master told me was nothing but a nonsensical, exaggerated lie.”
“All of a sudden, I don’t want to believe it—”
“Yeah…”
“But we’re talking about Master here. She’s capable of anything.”
“Yeah…”
Kino suddenly looked back. She gazed at the road they just came through. There was nothing but the leaves dancing on top of the road.
“It’s all right. There’s nobody,” said Hermes.
“So look ahead as you run.”


Kino entered the country around noon.
Kino and Hermes stood in front of the lawn-enclosed, octagonal building with a clock tower in its center. They stopped at the end of a road that extends straight towards it. There were people enjoying a picnic on the lawn under the clear autumn sky. A few policemen could be seen among them.
“It’s a good thing the historical building remained.”
“Yeah,” Kino agreed to Hermes’ words.
“It’s octagonal, without a doubt.”
“And there’s the clock tower too.”
Kino launched Hermes and ran on the road surrounding the building.
“Kino, go a little slower.”
“Hmm?”
In response to Hermes, Kino loosened the right-hand accelerator. Hermes told her that there’s a monument beside the building’s entrance, and Kino turned in that direction.
Kino stopped Hermes in front of the monument and cut the engine. The monument was not large, and was placed obscurely on top of the grass.
Only small characters were carved on the stone. Kino set down Hermes’ stand and crouched in front of the monument.
“Kino you’re blocking the view. What’s written on it?” asked Hermes.
“The characters are small and hard to read… It doesn’t seem to be a commemoration stone for the building’s foundation, though…” Just as Kino muttered this,
“Actually, that is—”
“Whoa—!”
A loud voice sprung from behind them, surprising Hermes. Kino stood up and turned around.
It was a bald old man with a cane. He looked considerably old, and with him was a four or five year old girl who seemed to be his granddaughter or great-granddaughter.
“Ah, sorry if I surprised you. That is a monument built to commemorate the two heroes who saved our country,” said the old man. 
Hermes asked, “Two heroes?”
Kino took off her hat and bowed to the old man and the girl. “I’m a traveler, but I have interest in the history of countries. Can you please tell me the story?”
The old man smiled. “Why, of course. When I was still young, political corruption has grown widespread in this country,” he began.
“Ooh. And then, and then?”
“Even the police were involved in the misdeeds, and everywhere you go, there’s this bad atmosphere. At that time, two travelers with a strong sense of justice came to our country. They spoke up on behalf of the citizens, saying ‘This should not be done!’ or ‘This is wrong!’” The old man recounted passionately.
“After that, after that?” Hermes chimed in happily.
“After that, the two travelers, backed by the power of the masses, came and petitioned in this building—in this government building.”
“Amazing!”
“Justice and courage overflowed from the two. In fact, their speech lasted for four days. Their zeal touched our politicians and police officials, who were deeply embarrassed of their actions until then and promised not to do bad things in the future. Thanks to that, this country is now rich and happy. And they lived happily ever after. The end.”
When the old man finished speaking, the girl whose hands he was holding jumped in delight, “Grandpa’s stories always end with ‘happily ever after’!” 
“There, there. You’ll make this old man fall over with your jumping,” the old man chided her with a smile.
“I see, so this monument was for that historic event,” Kino remarked.
“That’s right. Even now, the story about the ‘two travelers of justice’ is written in our history textbooks. When this child grows up, she’ll also learn it at school.”
Kino thanked the old man, and then asked, “This is another story, but…what happened to your legs? In this country, there are so many old people, particularly men, who are carrying canes with them.”
For about five seconds, the old man’s face twitched and froze. The girl looked up at him wonderingly.
“Uh, w-well! —People my age were born with bad legs, you see. The c-cane-manufacturers made a k-killing out of it, too,” the old man stammered, his expression still stiff. And as he laughed, he gripped his cane firmly, dragged one foot and walked away together with the girl.
When the two have vanished from sight, “What now, Hermes? Want me to read the monument just in case?”
“Nope,” Hermes answered immediately. Kino put on her hat, straddled Hermes, and started the engine.
Kino rode Hermes slowly, the building behind them. They began to converse as soon as they were out of earshot.
“That was something. Kino, which one do you think is true?”
“You can tell, can’t you, Hermes.”
“Yeah. But it’s an optimistic country, in a way. And being optimistic is a good thing.”
“In a sense, maybe.” Kino agreed with Hermes, laughing lightly. And then,
“But, what will you do if Master makes a comeback?” Hermes asked casually.
Kino suddenly looked back. She gazed at the road they just came through. There was the form of the big building with the clock tower.
“It’s all right. There’s nobody,” said Hermes.
“So look ahead as you run.”




"
58,v8c2,8,2,"There was once a traveler named Kino.
Despite her young age, she was very skillful with persuaders (Note: A gun), and almost no one could surpass her.
Kino’s companion in her travels is a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) called Hermes. Hermes’ rear back seat was converted into a carrier and loaded with lots of luggage on top. Because Kino is a traveler, she goes around visiting various countries.


Once, Kino and Hermes arrived in a certain country.
Inside a forest thickly grown with trees that will make your neck hurt if you try to look up at their tops, there was a green wall covered profusely with ivy—it was as if it was deliberately being hidden from view. The season neared the end of spring. It was neither warm nor cold, and a pleasant breeze was blowing.
“It’s just as the rumors say, Kino.”
“Yeah, if we weren’t told about this country, we would never have found it.”


At the gates, Kino asked for approval to stay for three days. And as she was a rare visitor, she was warmly welcomed and was soon given a permit by the sentry. The gates opened with a clatter.
What was seen upon passing through the gates was the last of the forest, with the scenery suddenly transforming into an open and level land. There was a meandering expanse of fields and pastures, and groups of domestic animals grazing leisurely on the grass. It was a little country with a population comparatively smaller than its vast land, and doesn’t seem to have seen much advancement in science. Since it was almost evening, small streams of smoke could be seen rising out from the chimneys of log cabins here and there.
“It seems like a good country,” Hermes said. Kino agreed, and then decided to look for an inn.
Kino asked around when they arrived at the center of the country, which had many buildings. But there was nothing like an inn in this country to which almost no traveler ever comes. Out of kindness, they were allowed to borrow one room in the large wooden building that seemed to be the town hall, as it was the gathering place of the residents. Kino was able to sleep under sheets after a long time.


The next morning.
“Jeez, so noisy—”
Hermes, who normally wouldn’t wake up even if you kick him hard, was roused with a loud noise coming from the streets.
The noise that drifted into the streets from a megaphone tied to a telephone pole was a voice accompanied with a peculiar melody. The voice had an odd accent, with words repeating over and over again like an incantation. It was completely incomprehensible. Even the background music was so bizarre, it would make one wonder what the composer looked like.
Kino, who woke up at dawn as usual, was already finished practicing with her persuader and physical exercises, taking a shower, and eating her breakfast, which was portable rations due to the lack of a cafeteria in this country.
“What a wonderful country. —I didn’t have to smack you awake, Hermes.”
“This isn’t a joke. What in the world is happening here? Ah, there it goes again.”
“I’d like to know myself. We’ve been to many countries before and have seen a lot of things, but it’s the first time there’s something like this. So, let’s go check it out today.”
And so Kino and Hermes left the building to go sightseeing.
And immediately, they were surrounded by people.


Upon being surrounded by the residents, the first thing that surprised them was the strange bamboo garments that they wore. Everyone was dressed in clothes that Kino had never seen in any country before. But it was unfathomable as to what kind of purpose the person who made it had in mind. 
Then they all spoke, asking Kino one after the other whether they performed their religious ceremony well…or not.
“Religious ceremony?”
Kino cocked her head as she did not understand the question’s meaning, so the people explained.
What they were performing was a religious ceremony. First, they wanted to ask whether the traveler was a ‘believer’, as this religion was supposedly widely accepted in many countries, and has a fairly large amount of followers. If it were not the case, as she must have witnessed the ceremony in some other country, they would like her to tell them whether their own version of the ceremony was good. Wouldn’t it be too embarrassing to show it to adherents from other countries? Would it make them closer to God? They asked unanimously.
“Kino?” Hermes asked.
“Um—” Kino began. The people paid attention. “It’s a pity, but I came from a small country and I didn’t know about this ceremony. Moreover, I merely drop by in the countries I visit, so I don’t have enough time to get acquainted with their culture. I’m really sorry to let everyone down.” 
What he was about to say was completely different, so Hermes remained silent.
The strangely-clad residents of the country were fairly disappointed by these words, but they soon pulled themselves together, and said that since it can’t be helped, Kino can just get to know the religion in this country.
And so Kino spent the time until lunch hearing from various people about their wonderful religion, its incomprehensible doctrine, and the ceremony, which could only be described by the word ‘weird’. Hermes was asleep the whole time.
Kino had to put up with this ordeal, but her mood lightened up when she was invited to a big house to eat lunch along with the other people.
During their after meal tea, one middle-aged woman talked to Kino.
“It’s such a relaxing and heart-warming religion, so it was proclaimed official quickly.”
“Huh? Since when was it propagated in this country?” Hermes asked.
The answer they gave was unexpected. It appeared that this religion was only spread in this country about ten years ago, and only a lone missionary who happened to arrive in the country did the work. However, it spread throughout the country in no time at all. If he had so wanted, this missionary could have obtained a luxurious life or immense political power. But he was not greedy, and even now, he chose to live in a small house at the edge of the countryside, and lives a quiet life while meeting with his believers from time to time.
“If it were not for that man, I believe this country would have become worthless. No, it may be that this country would have been gone by now,” said one man.
“What do you mean?” Kino asked.
The man explained as a representative of the crowd. Ten years ago, this country fell into a so-called ‘dark age’. No crop was harvested, animals could not reproduce, bad weather continued on end, a strange ailment befell the people, children did not listen to their elders, so on and so forth.
“That’s exaggerated,” Hermes blurted out without thinking, but the people were dead serious.
Weariness and despair spread among the people, and just when everybody was on the verge of giving up, he came—a missionary disguised as a worn-out traveler.
‘If you can, please do as I say. —You will gain peace in your soul.’
He began to preach with these words. Originally, they had a native religion, but no one had any idea when it started. However, when it did not help them in their hardships, the citizens readily abandoned it and embraced the new faith. They prayed desperately, conducted ceremonies, and implored with all their might.
“And then a miracle occurred.”
From then on, the harvest became fruitful, the livestock multiplied, the illness faded away, the weather calmed down, the children listened to their elders. The country was showered with blessings, and each person regained their health, both in mind and body.
“I see,” Kino said as she was taking a bite out of her tea cake.
“T-t-t-t-t-t-t-there’s trouble!” A lone man leapt into the room with a pallid face.
“I don’t know what happened, but you don’t have to be that flustered. God is watching us, you know.”
The man was admonished by the others to collect himself. However,
“But! The missionary w-w-w-wanted to m-m-meet with the t-t-t-traveler, just the two of them!”
“What!” “What did you just say?!” “No way!” “Are you kidding?!”
Everyone went in a panic.


“It is extremely rare for him to see anyone else other than a representative. This is such an honor, so don’t you dare be disrespectful!”
Being told such, Kino and Hermes headed towards the house of the missionary.
They rode around the country, following behind a man’s tractor. The people who were doing farm work waved their hands as they passed through the fields and crossed the pastures.
“You just have to go straight through here. I’ll be on my way. —I beg you; please do not show him any discourtesy.”
Having parted with the guide, Kino and Hermes also went beyond the outskirts of the country, and entered the path towards a reforested area.
Upon doing so, they soon found a small log cabin that stood silently among the trees. As they were informed, it was the missionary’s house.


As Kino stopped Hermes’ engine, a lone man went out of the house.
Dressed in ordinary shirt and pants, it was a middle-aged man with a passive expression. Both his face and body were slim; his face was cleanly shaved and he had no beard. 
“… I’m glad you came. I welcome you along with your motorrad.”
The man spoke gently to Kino and gestured for her to come. They entered the log cabin, and then she set Hermes beside the table on his center stand.
The man invited Kino to sit down, and sat opposite her. He joined his hands in front of his face. And then, he gave Kino a straight, intense glare.
The first thing the man said was, “Did you tell?”
Neither Kino nor Hermes understood what he meant.
“If you did, I will have all of the citizens go after you, and you will not be able to get out of this country alive,” he then said.
This time Kino somehow understood his meaning, and asked, “About what?”
“About that religion I taught them,” the man said, and Hermes understood.
“I knew it. You’re a fraud.” For a moment, the man trembled, surprised with Hermes’ blunt words. Hermes was unfazed, and continued, “What you mean to say is, we are not supposed to tell what we have seen or heard.”
“I haven’t said anything yet. —But, I don’t think they would believe what I would say,” Kino said.
“But, if you say anything I will kill you. I will never let you out of this country alive. You can count on it.”
“I’m not going to tell. Hermes too!”
“My tongue might slip.”
“Then I will have to leave you behind—”
“I was lying. I’m not saying anything. I don’t have any reason to do so.”
The man took one long breath, and grunted,
“I see… Then, it’s all right.”


There was silence for a while.
“Is that all you have to say to us? If so, then we will go back to our sightseeing,” Kino said.
The man said yes, and nodded, and Kino stood up from her chair.  But soon the man seemed to have changed his mind, and stopped them. He put his joined hands on his forehead.
“It’s all…a ridiculous sham… It was just something I said in the spur of the moment; just some random speech I came up with… Ah…” 
“…”
The man began his monologue, his head still hung down. Kino silently looked down on him. Just behind her, the motorrad named Hermes asked a question.
“Mister, if you were not a ‘missionary’, then were you originally a traveler?”
“That’s right… I was a traveler, a wanderer… Ten years ago, I arrived in this place, where no one would have thought a country existed.”
“What was your reason for lying? Did you intend to deceive them?”
“No… At the beginning I was all alone, and I really needed help. Then on the roadside, I saw a girl all worn-out. I told her, 
‘If you say this, you’ll feel better. It’s a prayer from my country.’
“Without giving it a thought, I taught her a charm…something my grandmother used to say to me to cheer me up when I was just a child. I thought it would be nice if that child feels better from it…”
The man’s spiel continued.  The girl, just as the man had hoped, felt much better upon reciting the words with a strange ring in them; words she had never heard before. Though it was a mere psychological effect, the family of the child made a big deal out of it, and spread rumors. Soon, the poor who were exhausted of their lives began pouring into the same room where Kino and Hermes stayed in the night before, to visit the man.
“If only I stopped that time…if only I told them it was all a lie…”
Furthermore, the man thought of a fitting incantation, as well as a religious ceremony modeled after some callisthenic exercises he had learned back in his childhood.
“That family taught it to their neighbors, and soon it became popular in their whole village.”
The fad in this village spread bit by bit to the whole country, and soon, more and more people came to visit the man, seeking to learn about this ceremony.
“I couldn’t tell them the truth…”
The man boldly declared to the people who relied on him:
‘I will teach everyone about this religion ‘×××××’, which has saved a great number of people in my own, and in many other countries!’
With all his might, the man spread to everyone in the country the teachings he came up with, the ceremonies he fabricated one night he couldn’t sleep, the religious melody he composed out of thin air, and the festival outfit he happened to see in a country he visited one time.
“… How naïve! How foolish these beings are!” 
The man snarled, his hands still fixed on his forehead.
“I see, it was a very interesting story—” Hermes began, “But, what exactly do you intend to accomplish by telling us all this? Do you want Kino to get you out of this country? Do you need help in escaping?”
The man lifted his face to this question. Kino, who had been silent all along, became slightly surprised when she saw the man’s face.
“How preposterous!”
So said the man, his face smiling, and his eyes beginning to get blurry with tears. It was a wonderful smile.
“I don’t want to leave this country! To leave here you say?!” the man declared as he parted his firmly joined hands and curled them tightly into fists.
“Oh? —But why?”
“That’s because—” the man answered with a smile, but was only able to say this much before his words trailed off. He placed his fists on the table.
Before Kino and Hermes who looked on in surprise, tears began to flow down from the man’s eyes like waterfalls. The tears streaked down his cheeks and fell to his knees.
“That is…that is… I-It was because…I was saved by this country…” The man said brokenly as he cried.
“I…did not wish to go on a journey… I just couldn’t bear to stay in my home country… It’s just that…I was born to a family of low social standing… I was abused and scorned my whole life… I couldn’t stand it anymore—”
The man raised his fists from the table. He lifted his gaze and spread his arms apart. It was as if he was trying to seize the sky.
“Then, I stumbled upon this country. A country that needed me! A country I was meant to save!”
Neither Kino nor Hermes said anything, and only looked at the man who gazed up at the sky with tears gushing forth from his eyes.
“This is a wonderful country! I was saved by this country!”


Soon Kino left the log cabin, pushing Hermes along. The man couldn’t see their backs behind his tears, which fell from his eyes like waterfalls.
“Indeed…I don’t believe in God or the like… But! But if there really is a God…please let me stay in this country like this. The land that I saved…please do not take it away from me. I just want everything to stay as they are… Oh, God—” 


"
59,v8c3,8,3,"[Good evening to everyone listening to our government radio station. Thank you for waiting. It is time for this station’s most popular radio program, brought to you twice a week—“Mr. Scherzi’s Start Now!” Tonight as well, we will be enlightened with various issues that would go unnoticed without Mr. Scherzi’s sharp insight. Our previous week’s broadcast, “Futility of Electricity, Futility of the Mind”, received plenty of reaction through phone calls and letters. Thank you very much. —Now Mr. Scherzi, please be our guide once again.]
[Good evening and thank you.]
[Let’s cut to the chase. Our topic for this evening is ‘traveler’, isn’t it?]
[Yes, ‘traveler’. For tonight, I want to develop my discussion from this.]
[Why is that again?]
[Of course. —Well, I’m sure everyone knows about the traveler who  
entered our country four days ago, and left just yesterday evening. Some of you may have even seen this traveler in person.]
[This rare visit even made it to the news. It was a traveler called Kino, who came to our country on a motorrad. Apart from the traders flowing into our country, it has been more than five years since a ‘pure’ traveler made their way here.]
[It is likely that among you, there are those who were glad that someone came from a different land to this small, isolated country. And probably, some of you were pleased with the thought that ‘we are not alone’, and having seen that the traveler had a safe stay and left with a smile, were relieved that you didn’t make a blunder during his visit.] 
[Ah, it’s just as you say. Why, it’s been such a long time, after all. I won’t go as far as naming them here, but it seems that there were even politicians present in the welcoming party held in the dining hall of a lodging house built from our taxes.]
[Anyway, speaking of carrying out our duty as hosts, I suppose we did a good job. But please hold on. Has everything really ended well? That is our theme this time.]
[You mean to say?]
[I’ll go straight to the point and say my conclusion—that traveler is a fake.]
[Eh? He’s not a genuine traveler?]
[That’s right. There were several ‘strange’ points that made me adhere to this conclusion. Before the main discussion, I’ll raise several examples of these points. First of all—the traveler’s age.]
[It was quite a young fellow. Around mid-teens, I say.]
[Exactly. His youth was thoughtlessly and recklessly published in the newspapers as surprising and impressive, but this was the first detail that made me suspicious. For someone that young to go traveling all alone—isn’t that beyond common sense? Why is it that no one noticed this fact?]
[Oh, now that you mention it…that is true…]
[Be that as it may in his home country, still, wasn’t that an age where he should still be going to school? Moreover, do you think that’s a conduct parents would normally approve?]
[Ah, but see here. Wasn’t that a case of ‘making your beloved child go on a journey’?]
[That was a proverb they used to say a lot in the past, but people has taken it out of context. Those words originated from an era where traveling is the only way for a person to undergo successive hardships. But it actually means roughly the same as ‘spare the rod, spoil the child’. Today, having your child travel in lawless regions between countries is taking it to a dangerous extreme. And from that, we can see another point come to surface.]
[Oh, and that is?]
[That is, the contrived nature of such a youth going across lands rife with danger.]
[I see… Well, he was carrying a persuader, though.]
[Indeed he was carrying one. Unless you are some man of legendary strength, there is absolutely no way you could go on a journey without having any weapon. —But if I have to say it, that was a mistake.]
[‘That’, meaning?]
[That hand persuader hanging from his right thigh. I only saw it in photos, but it certainly looked like a six-chambered high-caliber revolver.]
[And how was it a mistake?]
[What I am saying is that it was a persuader that would be impractical for any traveler to have. This will be slightly technical, but let me explain. It was a type of revolver that requires its bullets, gunpowder, and primer to be packaged separately. It’s a rather old kind, different from the ones in general use nowadays, which use bullet cartridges.]
[Oho. And what about this old type?]
[You see for this type, once you’ve fired off all six shots, reloading takes such a tremendous amount of time. Now that there are automatic-type persuaders that can fire twenty or thirty rounds in one load, using that sort is a bit, you know…]
[Figuratively speaking, ‘why use a quill when you can use a fountain pen’, right?]
[Yes, you nailed it. One has to choose a weapon for a journey thoroughly and realistically. Taking such an antique item to deck out oneself is mere self-gratification, a display of artlessness.]
[I see… As usual, your sharp viewpoint enlightens us.] 
[But indeed, not one person from this country noticed. But still, saying, ‘It’s understandable, since not everyone is well-versed when it comes to persuaders,’ is a rather shallow excuse, I say. —It’s a good example of slacking off and overlooking a fatal mistake.]
[Indeed. So even though he had a weapon, you noticed this one ‘odd’ detail about it.]
[Yes. —But, it’s not just the persuader, that motorrad is strange as well.]
[Oh?]
[It’s too big. Both the wheels and the engine. When you are choosing a motorrad, it is typical to pick something that would be suited to your body type. And so, there’s no reason for him to choose such a bulky model.]
[I see. Now that you mention it, it really looked unnatural for that traveler.]
[There’s more.]
[More?]
[He had a rather neat appearance. It’s strange no matter how you look at it. It seems that he was clean enough to not raise any attention while walking around the city. I heard that the guards and the inspectors at the gates were pleased with that.]
[Yes, there were such reports indeed. —But according to the person himself, he cleans up whenever he has the chance.]
[It can’t be that simple. What? After camping out in a place without a shower? Don’t tell me he had been swimming in a freezing river this late in autumn? Everyone sure was easily fooled.]
[Speaking of travelers, isn’t it expected for them to have scruffy beards and be quite dirty?]
[That’s too much stereotyping, but still, he’s too tidy…]
[I see. The flaws are coming out one after the other. I’m just beginning to see the truth myself.]
[There are various perspectives. However, you should not think that you have seen everything just from a fleeting glance of what’s before your eyes. You will only be easily fooled that way. You were intentionally shown only what is right in front of you, but there are a lot of things that people don’t want you to see.]
[Indeed, we know that there are a lot of people who can easily be deceived in this country.]
[And just as I have said from the start, that person is a ‘pseudo-traveler’—a fake. It’s just a person pretending to be an aloof traveler who wandered through the wilderness, alone with his motorrad.]
[Then, Mr. Scherzi, according to your conclusion, what is that traveler’s real identity, once and for all?]
[Ok. It’s probably a person from a neighboring country. We can’t really limit it to the closest countries, but he should be living in a country nearby. Of course, that he continues to travel by himself is a lie. A big fat lie.]
[And so—]
[He must be an extremely immature guy from a well-to-do family. He came to a place somewhere close to this country with a truck or something, taking the motorrad and some attendants with him on a pleasant journey. Of course, they must have paid a good deal for guards. Along the way, he must have had a cook to prepare wonderful meals for him to eat, and clean clothes to change into every day.]
[And then, he disguised himself before he entered the country.]
[Yes. He dressed up ‘like’ a traveler, piled up some luggage on the motorrad, and in order to convincingly play the role of an achiever, added the persuader. If a veteran traveler were to enter the country, this rustic country’s people would be very glad. I am sure he must have thought that he would be able to savor the pleasant feeling of being pampered and being looked at with admiring eyes. There’s no doubt that deep inside, he’s snickering at the gullibility of our countrymen.]
[That gives him quite a bad character.]
[We were all taken for a ride. Upon leaving the country, he must have been united with his friends. About this time, they’re on the way home to their country, laughing their hearts out. It was a mere three-day journey, after all.]
[That may be true. But he did say that he had decided on this as a rule for his journey.]
[I think that the truth is he would have liked to stay as long as he can. But in order to not let his disguise wear off, he lied and made up a traveler-ish ‘personal rule’ as an escape.]
[I see. There is some truth to that way of thinking.]
[Though in all respects, he was only a cowardly con artist, right about now, he may be announcing to his chums how he was able to completely deceive a whole country. —But now that the truth has been revealed, broadcasted and has become well-known facts, from here on, no matter what he thinks or what he says to anyone, it will only be a proof of his foolishness, nothing but piling shame upon shame.]
[In a way, he’s blessed for not knowing it.]
[Well, this may look only like a youth’s pranks exposed in broad daylight. However…seeing that his identity went unchallenged and that he was pampered due to our countrymen’s naiveté only shows that there is some problem with our people’s critical ability and prudence. The main message that I want to impart this time is this: The spreading disease of ‘lack of critical thinking’ and ‘simple-mindedness’ in this country.]
[‘Lack of critical thinking’ and ‘simple-mindedness’, is it?]
[Yes. Those two comprise tonight’s theme. Adults of ‘good sense’ from our country believed this traveler without a second thought. If he were not a mere ill-natured trickster, but was actually a spy sent by an enemy country, what would have happened?]
[That’s not a very appealing thought… They would probably think that this country is very submissive.]
[That might be seen as a reason for having a national defense, but it is not necessarily impossible. With that, I want our concerned citizens to seriously reflect about this.]
[Indeed.]
[There are too many gaps in this country.  That is, there are too many gaps in its people. I want everyone to know that indifference and innocence are things that at times, can be considered as crimes.]
[The innocence of children is still pleasant, though…]
[About that. Though everybody thinks children are innocent, there are many of them who have composure and are capable of rational judgment. In fact, when my nephew heard the news about a traveler entering the country, it seems that he asked his parents many times over, ‘Really? Did a traveler really came?’ In other words, the child was able to see through his camouflage. This is quite amazing. A proof that a mere four-year-old child was able to get closer to the truth than the great majority of our citizens.]
[The accuracy and keenness of a child’s observation is really shocking at times.]
[Definitely. And when they grow up, that will be reversed, and what will emerge is the carelessness of an adult. It would be great if everyone turns back into children all at once.]
[That’s a bold proposal, but if that were to happen at once, this country might fall into ruin.]
[Well, it’s ruined enough as it is. This country is already in the process of decay. —Just as I said before, if all the adults here were to die at once, then that will give birth to a country of nothing but children. But once those children become adults, the world at that time will be much more preferable than the one we have right now. I assure you. —But of course, something like that is not possible, so we’ll just have to do with the tragedy of a country we have right now.]
[These blunders, or deeply ingrained ‘mistakes’ of adults—where did they come from?
[That is of course, a problem of the ‘mind’. I have been saying it from the beginning, but, right now, the adults don’t understand at all what that true ‘mind’ really is. And they don’t try to understand it. They don’t notice that they’re losing something important. They continue to pretend that they don’t notice. And the tragedy goes on. That is the true present condition of this country.]
[I see. It only means that adults no longer have a mind for ‘self-criticism’. —It’s about time, but let’s give way for tonight’s conclusion.]
[‘Lack of critical thinking and simple-mindedness’— If we continue living our lives like this, then we are headed to a mental downfall of this country. I’ve said it many times before, but that day is just right at the corner. People who haven’t realized it yet may be laughing lightheartedly, but for the sake of this country, please realize that that day of despair is about to come.]
[Thank you very much. —Everyone, what do you feel about this? We’ll be awaiting your phone calls or letters for your opinions and requests. See you again next time. Next will be the weather corner.]


[Hello. Is it all right to call now?]
[It’s okay.]
[Did you listen to the broadcast just now?]
[Of course. Just as always, that guy did a good job stretching out some obscure theory.] 
[It was amazing. Usually, I erase the recording, but I saved it this time. When he talked about ‘minds’ out of the blue, I spewed out the tea I was drinking.]
[I roared out laughing when I heard about his nephew ‘who saw the truth on his own’.]
[Then there was that old ‘waiting for the day of despair’ discussion. He went talking about how he was so smart, being the only one to have noticed it, and all.]
[Yeah. —But they have been saying that non-stop since five years ago. Just when is that day gonna come?]
[They’ll keep on saying that until it comes, so someday they’ll get it right.]
[Hahaha. That corner is really fun. I want it to go on.]
[You bet. By the way, do you think the traveler was really like that?]
[Traveler? Ah, the traveler that was used as primer for discussion. —Whether it’s true or not doesn’t really matter anymore.]


“Hello there. Mr. Scherzi, thanks for today’s work.”
“Yeah.”
“Today’s show was also quite impressive. About this time, our PR must be getting flooded with phone calls. It will probably surpass the record of our previous installment.” 
“That’s great but…there’s some weakness in the evidence, or a hole perhaps. But it’s just an opinion, so I guess it doesn’t matter.”
“Oh? Well let’s hear it for now.”
“That argument about the persuader. It may be true that his choice of weapon was offhand, but if it’s for traveling purposes, then it is reasonable to avoid bringing heavy weapons or those that use too much ammunition. That persuader uses gunpowder that can be bought everywhere and its bullets can be hand-made from molten lead. It is quite convenient in terms of not having to carry too much bullets with him. I believe that traveler knows this very well.”
“Your obsession is kicking in again. You really are detailed when it comes to persuaders, Mr. Scherzi.”
“There’s one more.”
“Yes, what is it?”
“There’s a hot spring about half a day’s travel to the east. That traveler must have camped out there. That was why he was clean. The water and steam there can be used as much as one likes, after all. Geologists know about this, so it would be a better not to mention it too much.”
“Okay… For the time being, I’ll mention it to our script writer. But you know, almost nobody who listens to us will understand that.”
“That may be true, though.”
“Well, help us again next time, Mr. Scherzi! Thanks for the good work!”
“Sure. Thank you.”

 
"
60,v8c4,8,4,"There was a lone road in a mountainous region where winter has just made its presence known.
The mountains’ gentle slopes were lined up with slender trees that lost their leaves during autumn. As a result, there was very little color anywhere; everything had a monochromatic shade of light brown.
The dazzling morning sun brought out the bold contrast between the clear, blue sky and the forest. Even so, the occasional strong gust of wind was cold and dry.
The road ran level with the slopes, looking as if it was sewn on the mountains. It was dismal and bare due to the dry atmosphere, and was not even littered with fallen leaves.  It was only wide enough to let one car pass through.
And on this road ran a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly).
Its rear wheel had boxes on both sides and was topped with traveling luggage. It raised a thin cloud of dust as it proceeded on the road roughly to the west.
The rider was wearing a long brown coat, the excess hem of which was rolled up to her thighs. She wore a brimmed hat with flaps covering both ears, and goggles with a silver frame that was already peeling off in places.
Before each curve, the rider would loosen the accelerator, incline the motorrad while keeping her gaze forward, and gradually accelerate once again as the road straightened out. As soon as they passed through the first mountain, the next mountain came in sight.
While running, the rider of the motorrad opened her mouth, and let out a lifeless voice.
“Ah…”
“What’s the matter, Kino?” the motorrad asked. The rider whose name was Kino replied with a sigh,
“I’m hungry.”
“Then stop and rest! If you collapse from hunger—” The motorrad nagged.
“Fine, fine. Riding a motorrad is a sport, and so on. It’s just like running, etc. And so the moment… I’ve heard that countless times already, Hermes,” Kino continued.
“If you know, then you should do it,” the motorrad called Hermes answered incredulously.
“Well, it was bad enough that the previous country was in ruins,” Kino said as she went past a curve, and then continued, “If only it were not, I would have been able to relax and eat something delicious as planned.”
“My sympathies, Kino. I thought that country we visited was just recently abandoned; but it seemed like it was the work of a terrible storm. There was not a speck of food, only the rolling white bones of corpses.”
“You sure are lucky, Hermes. We were able to scrape up plenty of fuel from junk cars… Thanks to that, I had to put up with the stench of that old fuel.”
“Good job.”
“Well, thanks. Moreover, there’s very little crop in this forest… I was wondering if there were animals that could be eaten around here, so I’ve been keeping close watch for some time, too.”
“You’re free to shoot if anything shows up. But there are no squirrels, let alone deer.”
*Sigh*
Kino and Hermes both fell silent and continued to ride impassively.
It was a little before noon. After they finished ascending the slope that appeared before them, and when they have crossed over its gentle ridge, an enormous basin came into view.
And in that basin, there were people.


“What could that be, Kino?”
“Who knows…?”
Kino and Hermes slowly descended the hill road. As they approached the basin, the mountain changed into a dry land completely devoid of trees and grass.
There were hoards of people just ahead the road. People have gathered by the hundreds, and the center of the basin looked as if it would be completely filled with humans. Tent-like structures could be seen amidst the crowd.
“They don’t seem too happy.”
“I wonder if they are refugees…”
“It looks that way,” Hermes agreed.
The assembly of people buried the center of the basin, turning it into a black carpet. There were so many people that the ground was barely visible. The road that continued to its center looked like a thin, brown line amidst the black mass. Beyond the cluster, there was a big hole on the ground.
Kino and Hermes descended further down the hill and approached.
The people were in a terrible condition.
Despite the cold weather, everyone wore tattered clothing. The people were abnormally thin without exception—their cheeks hollow, their limbs like sticks. Only their big, blank eyes could be discerned from their dirty faces. There were people sitting or lying down on the ground, people on their sides who were barely moving except for their breathing. People were tightly packed inside the tents built here and about.
Kino parked Hermes before this mass.
“What a shock. How many people do you think are there?”
“Beats me… But there’s a tent that looks different from the rest over there on the left slope.”
On the south side, people could be seen from a tent that was slightly separated from the rest.
“From the looks of it, those are army troops. They’re wearing uniforms, and some of them even have persuaders (Note: A gun),” Hermes observed, and then asked, “What are we going to do in the meantime?”
“It would be great if there is someone we could talk to, someone who could explain to us what’s going on,” Kino said, and Hermes agreed.
Kino unfastened the front of her coat, and launched Hermes without removing it. Its hem slowly trailed in the wind as they rode closer to the ragged crowd.
Most of the people who turned their blank gazes towards Kino stood up. They were typically adult men carrying what appeared to be sticks in their hands.
They walked on the road, blocking it off. Then they glared at the slowly approaching motorrad.
Upon seeing what waited ahead, Hermes spoke, “I think they’re going to attack. I’m sure you look tasty to them, Kino.”
“That would be troublesome,” Kino replied casually.
“Can you fire two or three shots?”
“I told you, didn’t I? Very hungry—I am.”
“Oh, to emphasize you even used perverse word order.”
A few seconds of silence passed after Hermes’ remark. During that interval, they had gotten much closer to the dark mass of men barring their way.
Eventually, Kino asked Hermes, “… Um, ‘reverse word order’?”
“Yeah, that,” Hermes said, but he didn’t stop,
“Your reaction was so late. You must be really starving.”


“Excuse me, will you please let me pass?” Kino said. She stopped before the cluster of men who glared at her as they obstructed the way, but she did not alight nor turned off Hermes’ engine.
“…”
The men did not say anything. They only turned their gaunt, ghoul-like faces towards Kino.
“Everyone, if you don’t move, you’ll get run over by this brash rider over here,” Hermes said.
“How mean,” Kino complained.
Eventually, a man spoke up in a lifeless voice.
“… Anything will do.”
“What?”
“Anything will do… Share us some food… Whatever little you have… Everyone’s hungry.”
“Me too,” was Kino’s immediate reply.
And then she reached out for her right thigh. The hand that came out from underneath the coat gripped a single hand persuader. It was a high-caliber revolver that she called by the name ‘Canon’. 
Upon seeing this, the men heaved a sigh and kept silent.
Soon after, a shrill gunfire echoed.
The shot came from within the crowd. The men turned around and walked with frail steps to the side of the road. A four-wheel drive came running on the road towards Kino, driving away the people by the sides. Aboard it were four soldiers wearing green uniforms. They fired their persuaders several times towards the sky as warning.
The four-wheel drive stopped in front of Kino who had already holstered Canon. The person riding in its passenger seat told her to follow along until they reach the end of the road. Kino consented and answered with a gesture, and headed in the same direction as the other vehicle.
The four-wheel drive advanced on the road sandwiched by the refugees, with Kino and Hermes following from behind. A soldier on-board the vehicle held his persuader in a stance devoid of openings. The form of the two vehicles was reflected in hundreds of blank eyes.


Halfway through the cluster of people, there was a road that branched off to the south. The four-wheel drive turned to this path, and Kino followed. Once again, they drove amidst the refugees, and finally reached a road gently climbing up the slope. They went past the mass of refugees and headed towards the tent at the end of the road. In front of this tent was a fence made of thick logs.
The gate that was built on the road was protected by several soldiers armed with persuaders. When the four-wheel drive approached, a bar with red and white stripes lifted to let them pass. It was lowered as soon as Kino finished passing through.
It was an army’s camp. Green tents were lined up evenly, with soldiers standing on watch, or sitting and taking a rest. Cars and trucks were parked all about, and right beside each was a drum of fuel.
Kino stopped Hermes and took off her hat and goggles. Among the soldiers who observed, the man from the passenger seat got off and approached. Kino lightly bowed her head.
“Well, that was dangerous. If you had handed them just one candy, they would have flocked around you until you’re dead.”
“My thoughts, exactly.”
“Since our forces are here to protect our comrades and our equipment, we wouldn’t have been able to help you even if you got attacked, miss traveler.”
“Is that so? But you were a big help. Thank you very much.” Kino expressed her gratitude.
“Ah. It was purely ‘by chance’ that our regular patrol caught sight of you. —You are pretty lucky, miss traveler,” the man said nonchalantly, then guided Kino and Hermes to a tent. The tent, which was supported only by a pole and roof, was built slightly apart from the others. 
Over there were a number of officials wearing decorated uniforms, high in both rank and age, surrounding a table.
“We have brought along this traveler who happened to pass by, and whom we found ‘by chance’.”
“I see. Good job, Sergeant. You can go now.”
After the sergeant saluted and left, Kino introduced herself and Hermes.
One man introduced himself as the general. It was a man who, probably because of his imposing moustache tightly stretched on both sides, effected an air of self-importance. Afterwards, he informed Kino that they were the army of a neighboring country.
“What’s going on?” Hermes asked tersely. From their location, they could see very well beyond the fences the bottom of the basin down the slope, and the refugees in it.
“Oh, you mean them? Well, let me answer your question,” the general said while fixing his beard with his fingertips. And then he turned in the direction of the refugees. “There are many small countries in this area, but those people are originally from a country a bit to the east from here.”
“We saw it yesterday. Indeed, there was not a single person there. It was quite a sight.”
“Then I’ll make the story short. —For several years, no crops grew in this area because the summers were too cold. A record-breaking crop failure continued. And because of the negligence of the leader of that country, the problem of food provisioning was not resolved, until finally the country collapsed. Those who had strength escaped, but most of the people who couldn’t do anything became hungry refugees and wandered towards this basin.”
“Uh-huh. Do the surrounding countries have any plans to help?”
“Hmph. We would like to help if possible. But our country and our neighbors have our hands full with the same crop failure, and we don’t have spare provisions to help to that extent.”
“I see.”
“Without much choice, our country and neighbors have decided not to let them leave this basin so that they will not advance any further. And so we sent out our armies and kept watch in shifts.”
“What will become of them?” Kino asked. 
The general answered, “There’s nothing we can do for them. As we speak, a number of them die from hunger or illness. If several tens of people die each day, eventually no one will be left come spring. The only thing left for us to do is to drop the corpses in that large hole and fill it up with quicklime.”
“I see,” Kino said. A weak, cold wind blew, ruffling Kino’s coat and blowing down the basin.
“By the way, miss traveler.”
The general trained his gaze on Kino with a somewhat sinister look.
“Yes?”
“It’s almost noon. —Care to join us for lunch?”


“It’s very delicious. I’m impressed.”
Kino, in her black jacket and wearing a napkin around her neck, was sitting at a table under the roofed tent among the officials. A magnificent meal was lined up before them on the table.
The main course was a fat and juicy roasted ham steak in raspberry sauce and boiled sausages with pickled cabbages. There was a side dish of carrots and broccoli salad, which was warm but was not steaming due to the cold weather. It was served along with fresh mayonnaise. Furthermore, they were served a rye bread called kommissbrot[1] and a bottle of salt-free butter. There were fruits like apples, pears, and grapes. There was also hot tea in a pot and honey to go along with it.
Kino immediately replied with an ‘of course’ to the lunch invitation of the general. And just as the general told her, she did not hesitate at all, and ate the food with gleaming eyes. Hermes who was parked behind her remained silent.
“… It’s a good thing that you liked it,” the dumbfounded general replied with a forced laugh.
From the table where Kino and the rest were seated, the refugees at the bottom of the slope, who were suffering from hunger and despair, were in plain view. The fragrance was carried by the wind and reached them.
At this table, Kino continued eating heartily, but only enough so as not to appear ill-bred.
“General, among the food I have eaten until now, this black bread is the best.”
“That’s good to hear. Later, I’ll convey that compliment to our bread-baking unit.”
“Please do.”
As Kino cut up a large portion of the ham steak and carried it to her mouth, the general asked,
“By the way, miss traveler, is ‘cold-heartedness’ the most important emotion you should carry when traveling?”
Kino answered as she finished chewing the ham.
“No.”
“Oh, then what is it?”
“That is, love for yourself. I was taught that loving yourself more than others, in any circumstance, is the most important thing of all. —This ham is also very delicious.”


“We’ll be taking our leave. Miss traveler, please take your time.”
“Thank you very much, General.”
The bearded general and the other officials left the table as they finished eating. Most of the plates had leftover food.
Only Kino and one other person were left at the table.
It was a rather fat man whose body and face were both plump. His uniform looked quite tight on him.
He was slowly but surely cleaning up his own plate.
“… Hmm? Oh.”
He noticed Kino’s gaze, and then a light, awkward smile appeared on his face before he spoke.
“I’m doing my best so that nothing will be left.”
Kino, who had cleaned up her own plate nicely, looked at him while wiping her mouth with a napkin. He carried the last broccoli to his mouth with a fork and finished chewing.
“I know it looks like I’m just gorging myself—” He began to talk to Kino who was seated opposite him, slowly drinking her tea. “But you see, when I see those people dying from starvation right before my eyes but can do nothing to help them, I feel like it’s my duty to at least finish all the food before me.”
“I see.” Kino was not especially moved, but replied without a hint of criticism.
“Because of that, I have become so fat since I came here. —What’s the secret so that I can stay slim like you, miss traveler?” 
Kino considered the question for a while, and then,
“I suppose you won’t get fat if you ride a motorrad the entire day.”


After they finished their tea, they offered thanks for the meal and stood from the table.
One of them returned to his duties, while the other returned to her travels.














"
61,v9c1,9,1,"A road cut in between the forest and the river.

The thick woods was completely separated from the clear waters. Here, the river's leeve doubled as a road. It was on a slightly higher altitude compared to the river, and considerably higher compared to the forest.

The road's dirt was hard, mostly flat, and quite wide. It seemed to be quite regularly traversed through by wheeled vehicles.

However, right now, only a single motorrad (Note: Two-wheeled vehicle. Refers to only ones that cannot fly) was dashing down the path with extreme speed.

The motorrad's rider faced away from the dazzling sun, which had just risen up from the horizon. Their shadows stretched extensively toward the direction they were headed.

The rider was of slender figure; the shadow, long and thin. Wearing a light brown long coat, the excess length was wrapped around both thighs. Worn on the head was a hat with a small visor. It resembled that of an aviator's, and also of military uniforms. So as to not have it be blown away by wind pressure, the earflaps were tied way down to the chin. The rider also wore a pair of goggles, one of silver frame with chipped-off plating.

The damp morning forest air buffeted the slender, tough-looking face.

""What a nice road! But you're going way too fast!""

The motorrad shouted to its rider.

""What are you saying! Have you grown senile all of a sudden, Hermes?""

The rider shouted back, not at all easing on the acceleration. Cranked up to top gear, even. The motorrad engine roared so loudly that one would think the muffler was missing, and the vibration was so violent that one would fear some parts were broken.

The motorrad was one without a back seat, but rather a carrier. Bound on it were a large bag and a rolled-up blanket. Additionally, boxes for storing additional luggage was installed to both its sides, making it quite heavily equipped. All of those things clattered as the motorrad raced forth with extreme speed. A small silver cup, tied to a net, wobbled around intensely.

The road had occasional gentle bumps. The driver rushed onward without dropping the speed, and the motorrad was airborne.

The lump of metal leapt, sailed through the air for several meters, and landed with a thud.

""GYAH--!""

The motorrad, referred to as Hermes, screamed. Up to this point, the rider finally eased up the accelerator. The speed was dropped to about half of what it was at before, and the rider spoke up in a tone of uncontainable excitement.

""Whoa there, Hermes... You alright?""

Hermes replied, sounding quite resentful.

""Don't 'you alright?' me, Kino! I thought my frame was going to break apart!""

The rider, referred to as Kino, shifted the gear down one level and spoke up carelessly,

""It's fine, it's fine; I'm not breaking anything. That aside, we hit a hundred back there. Been a while since we last done that. While loaded up like this, no less. Be proud, Hermes.""

""Get this, Kino? For a motorrad, top speed would obviously mean 'the speed at which it breaks apart'.""

Hermes rebutted, in a composed manner.

Likely snapped out of the trance of excitement, Kino proceeded to speak in a calmer tone, left hand reaching down to lightly tap on the motorrad's tank twice,

""Sorry about that, Hermes.""

""What're you even rushing for?""

""Now, it's important that you use your abilities to the fullest once in a while. Otherwise your skill will grow dull before you even know it.""

""Oh, is that so...""

Hermes said in a monotone recitation, not at all impressed.

""That's right. Oh, and we'll be at the next country soon.""

""I don't really have faith in your 'soon,' Kino.""

To Hermes' grumbles, Kino said, left hand pointed forward,

""Look, over there.""

Beyond where Kino was pointing at was a gentle downward slope, and beyond it were city walls. The terrain was a shallow basin, with the gray wall amid a dark green forest encircling the city. The buildings inside stood in a disarray, and an enormous elliptical structure could be seen in the center.

""I've been wanting to visit this place for a while now.""

An expression of fascination was painted on Kino's face.

In a manner that suggested absolutely no interest, both in Kino and the country they're headed towards, Hermes muttered,

""Once we get there, I want to rest in some place dark, cool, and in just right the right level of humidity.""

===

""What was that?""

Kino, coat still on, loudly repeated the question. And so the gatekeeper, a young soldier, replied,

""I'll say it as many times as you like. You've entered the country. Which means you're automatically considered an eligible participant. 'Tis a set policy.""

Kino, with a mixed face of astonishment and disgust, asked on,

""So, you're telling me I have to take part in that contest?""

""That's right, boy. You came to this country without knowing that or what?""

The soldier said, in a manner as if taking Kino for a complete idiot.

Face painted with an outward expression of indignance, Kino said in a powerful tone,

""Could you please stop calling me 'boy'? I'm Kino.""

""Oh, whatever. But you're participating, and that's final. You know what'll happen if you don't?""

The soldier asked with a grin.

""How am I supposed to know?""

As Kino said so, the soldier delightfully continued,

""Then I'll tell you. You'll live the rest of your life here as a slave. Branded as a coward who refused to fight and ran away, that is.""

""What's up with that?""

""Isn't that obvious? It's the law of this country. Break it, and you get the death penalty.""

===

Kino and Hermes had just went through the procedures to enter the country which they arrived at the gate of. When that was over, the gatekeeping soldier said, 'your number is twenty-four.' With Kino being clueless as to what that meant, the soldier began his explanations with a look of exasperation.

In this country, once every three months, a contest was held for the rights of citizenship. Those who wished to live in the country would have to do battle in the colosseum, and the sole victor who made it to the end would be made citizen.

The contests were held over the course of three days. The opening day, which happened to be today, was host to the first and second rounds. The third and fourth would then commence tomorrow. And finally, on the third day, the final round would commence at noon. Participants were given free rein in choosing the weapons they employed. The spectation of others' battles were forbidden, however.

Either side could offer to surrender, but only when the opponent accepted it would the capitulation be effective. Otherwise, whomever was immobilized first would be deemed the loser. In most cases here, being immobilized would be synonymous to being killed. If one intended to flee from the contest, they would be charged with cowardice under fire and executed on sight.

Almost all the residents of the country crowded into the colosseum to watch the contest. Naturally, the king would also be spectating from his private seat. All spectators had absolutely no rights of complaint if they were hit by stray bullets and were injured or killed.

The king would grant a medal of citizenship personally to the last one standing. At that time, they would also be permitted to add one new law to the country. It could be anything and everything, as long as it did not contradict any other law that had been there prior. Although this might give the impression that the citizens were actually involved in the country's administrations, it was practically a mere reward. Up to now, the victors would only add laws to satisfy their selfish desires, such as 'from this moment forth, there shall not be a time when I do not have a house to live in'.

With all that said and done, today was the last day of reception. Those who have passed through the gate up until now, no matter who, now were automatically considered eligible participants of the contest.

===

""So what'll it be? You in? Or is it straight to the slave shed, li'l Kino? If you choose slavery, then you'll be the very first one, y'know.""

The soldier said. And while that was going on, the other soldiers, ones seemingly with free time on their hands, had gathered around. Each of them had a condescending sneer painted on their faces. As if to show off, they rattled their persuaders, (Note: Firearms) to the point of being excessive.

""Since when did this event begin?""

Kino asked the original soldier, disregarding all of the others.

""Around seven years ago. But really, you shouldn't call it just an event. What do you take the glorious rights of citizenship for?""

""Glorious rights of citizenship, you say?""

Kino glared at the soldier once more.

""I was told that this country was surrounded by greeneries, with forests and fields that provided plenty. And that the people who lived here were modest and led simple, splendid lives.""

From the back, another soldier came forward and interrupted.

""Hey, hey, that's still true. Don't just go ahead and write your own history like that. There's plenty to eat even if you don't work. It's what you would call a paradise on the mortal realm. Would be a waste if the likes of you were to get in.""

Keeping a perfectly calm tone, Kino directed a question toward everyone present.

""So what happened seven years ago?""

The young soldier turned to his compatriots, tilting his head and shrugging his shoulders, as if asking what he should be doing. One among the crowd, a middle-aged soldier, stepped forward and offered to specially educate the traveler on the subject.

""The king was succeeded. Seven years ago, his majesty the current king killed off the boring former king, making this country that much more exciting. It all began from there. Those who wished to live in this country came, and they came in heaps. But we couldn't just make all of those punks our citizens. That's why we had them fight; if they could provide us with entertainment, then it wouldn't hurt to let the just strongest one in. The rest can go straight to their graves for all we care.""

Having said all that, he then put his face right up to Kino's.

""Did you get all that, boy?""

Kino, facial expression unchanged, continued,

""Yes, I understood it. And I have another question.""

The soldier, looking unamused, bluntly talked back, ""What now?""

""Regarding those who participated in the contest, did all of them come knowing beforehand that it was going to be a fight to the death. Have there been any travelers like me who came without knowing the circumstances here?""

Pfft, gushed out the soldiers upon hearing the question, before completely breaking into hearty laughter.

""Heh heh heh, y'know, idiots like you turn up from time to time. We'd tell them nothing and let them in with a straight face, then all of them would be killed off right in the first round. They'd cry and beg to surrender, like their opponents would actually accept them. There's also this one time when a married couple lost their way and came ended up here on a horse carriage, but luckily they were matched together in the first round. The wife surrendered and got off safely, but the husband was killed in the next round. Boy, was that a masterpiece!""

The second half of his speech was like an invitation to his fellow soldiers to laugh together in reminiscing about that amusing of an incident. All of them were rolling about with laughter. And none of them noticed that Kino's eyes had narrowed down.

Hermes had been keeping silent right from the beginning, having been told that the subject was of no relevance to motorrads. This same Hermes also knew that Kino has been showing an unusually fierce emotion of anger.

And so the motorrad knew full well what Kino was about to say from this point on.

""Please lead me to it, then.""

""Called it.""

Hermes muttered.

One among the soldiers, preoccupied with wild laughter, looked at Kino and asked,

""Huh, did you say something?""

Met with Kino's expression as the traveler glared at him and his peers, the soldier was taken by surprise by a chill as cold as ice.

""Like I said, I want you to lead me to it.""

Kino, still glaring at the soldier, spoke in a detached voice.

All soldiers looked at Kino, their laughter cut off. The silence continued for a short while. One among the soldiers then asked in a tone as if taking Kino for an idiot.

""Whoa there, boy, you're really going to fight? You think you can win? Do you even have weapons? Don't tell me you're going to charm your opponents with that cute little face of yours? Ain't that many who fall for your type, y'know.""

As the soldiers heard that, right when they intended to burst into laughter, a thunderous roar resounded. Six helmets, previously hanged up on the wall, were all blown away. White smoke filled the interior.

For a short while, the soldiers were completely clueless as to what had just happened. Then, when the sound of the helmets falling and rolling on the ground finally entered their ears, they finally noticed the hand persuader in Kino's right hand. It was of the six-chambered revolver type, and Kino called it 'Canon'.

""How about that? Will it do?""

While saying that, Kino slowly returned the emptied Canon to its right thigh holster.

""Don't screw around, you little--!""

Now that the soldiers were finally done processing the situation, the young one, who had been there since the beginning, stepped forward with the intention of grabbing Kino. Right at the next moment, a persuader was thrust at his forehead. The persuader, drew out and held in Kino's left hand, was an automatic-type of thin silhouette that utilized .22LR bullets.

To the young soldier whose facial expression and body were frozen in place, and the other soldiers who found themselves in mute amazement, Kino calmly went on to say,

""I'm participating in the contest.""

===

""Now this is what I call a mess.""

After going through the gate, that was the very first thing Hermes said.

What entered Kino and Hermes' fields of vision were mountains of garbage. But the place was not a disposal site; the entire city was brimming with trash. The buildings and roads were all filthy, and it was obvious that they had never received any maintenance. Several inhabitants, clothed filthy, were sleeping in the road. The city was quiet, perhaps due to the lack of activities early in the morning. A number of frightfully fat dogs were scrounging for leftovers amid the trash heaps. The whole roadside area stank.

""Like city, like people eh, Kino? Or is it the other way around?""

Hermes said straight out, paying no mind to the soldiers who were guiding them. Kino kept quiet, pushing Hermes along while following the soldiers.

Walking down the filthy streets, they arrived at the colosseum after a short while. It was the same elliptical structure which they had seen from the distance. The tiered platforms of the spectator stands were high, but their edges were cracked in spots, exposing the metal framework within. The upmost tier was crooked particularly badly. It was a structure of horribly cheap construct.

""I don't know when this place was built or by whom, but this is some awful building. Bad taste in design, too.""

Once again, Hermes spoke in a manner that expressed unrestrained, honest opinions.

===

Kino was led to the colosseum's basement, and was explained that this place served as the participants' lodgings. The room was the kind that would make one unsure whether to actually call it lodgings, or consider it something akin to a prison, however. Inside it was a bed so worn-out that its springs poked out, a small window above it, and a washstand and a flush toilet, befitting of a country with an abundance of water supply. The place was dark, cool, and in just the right level of humidity.

""I don't even know where to start with this country...""

Hermes said to Kino right after the guiding soldiers left them. Kino's coat was removed and rolled up. The traveler was wearing a black jacket underneath it, with a thick belt wrapped around the waist.

Several pouches were attached to the belt, and to its right side, on the thigh, hung the holster of the persuader 'Canon'. To the backside of the waist was the holster of another persuader, the one Kino called 'Woodsman,' its grip pointed upwards.

""It wasn't like this in its olden days. It seemed to have been a wonderful country that any traveler would want to visit.""

Seated on the bed, Kino spoke in an uninterested tone while pulling out the Woodsman. Its magazine was dropped off. Its safety was unlocked, its slide shifted, and the bullet inside the chamber was then picked out.

""And because of that, you were so happy to get to come check it out, only to find that it's now like this. Looks like the man who became the current king really is extremely different from the last, huh?""

""Probably, yeah.""

Kino unloaded the luggage off Hermes, took out five empty magazines for the Woodsman, and began loading each of them up.

""Are you seriously going to do it, Kino?""

""Do what?""

Kino took out Canon, shifted its central wedge, then pulled the whole front half off the grip, barrel and all.

""The contest, I mean. I know you're offended and all, Kino, but that's no reason for you to play along with this crazy country. Just give your opponent a good shake in the first round, and when they're about to surrender, you do it yourself instead. Then we can kiss this place goodbye.""

""Oh, yeah, I could do that.""

Kino slipped Canon's cylinder off, then produced two empty cylinders from one of the pouches. While loading one of the cylinders into Canon, Kino said,

""But let's leave that as last resort.""

""I knew it... So you're seriously going to participate?""

""Yeah, for the time being, I plan to go as far as I can. Besides, if everything is going to end in three days, it wouldn't hurt to see it through.""

Using something that looked like a syringe, Kino proceeded to pour green liquid propellant into a cylinder's six empty chambers, then put in the felt paddings and bullets.

Canon's front half was then fitted back in place. The loading lever under the barrel was folded down, and with the plunger operating simultaneously, the lever mechanism pushed in the bullet in the cylinder's bottommost chamber.

Kino took care not to pack each of them in too tightly. The process was then repeated for the two other cylinders. After all bullets were fitted in, their tops were coated with plenty of grease. This was done so as to prevent the spreading of sparks from one chamber to the next while firing.

Then, the cylinders' backsides, where the hammer would strike, were covered with small caps. They were called percussion caps; when struck, the resulting sparks would serve to ignite the liquid propellant. They need not be fitted in one at a time by hand; they were placed through a dedicated loader with pre-fitted percussion caps. The loader's pointed end were to be applied to the cylinders' backside.

To Kino, who showed such an earnest expression while preparing those persuaders, Hermes spoke up.

""Good grief. There's no stopping you once you make up your mind, huh.""

Kino fiddled around to double-check Canon's functionality, then, as if recalling something, suddenly smiled and said,

""It's important that you use your abilities to the fullest once in a while. Otherwise your skill will grow dull before you even know it.""

Hearing that, Hermes then said in a monotone recitation,

""Oh, is that so...""

===

""So that's his majesty the king.""

Kino, still clothed in the same jacket, walked toward the center of the colosseum, while looking at the person sitting right in the middle of the spectator seatings. In the box seat, seemingly reserved for nobility, was a middle-aged man in gaudy clothing with a crown on his head.

The crown was of a simple design, which in itself gave the accessory a dignified appearance. It was a truly horrible match with the current king's showy attire.

On either side of the king were young women clad in equally flashy clothes. The royal box was encompassed in glass, brightly reflected sunlight.

""And these must be the glorious citizens.""

Kino slowly gazed around. The seats were filled to the brim with spectators excited to see murder before their eyes, regardless of their sex and age. Annoyingly loud sounds of cheer filled the air.

===

Just moments before, Kino had gotten out of the basement room, answering the call of the designated participants' numbers.

""I won't find it interesting anyway, so I'll pass. Try to keep it down so that they don't die, yeah?""

Hermes said, choosing instead to rest in the comfort of the room.

===

The colosseum's center was an elliptic field, scattered about with junk such as wrecked vehicles and demolished buildings. In the center of them all was a circular open space of about twenty meters in diameter; just that place was left completely clear.

The round would begin when both participants stood at opposite edges of the circle.

While on the way there, Kino painstakingly surveyed the area.

From the opposite side appeared a gigantic man, looking more like a mass of muscle with a head attached. His torso was bare, and his shaved head shone bright in the light. He held a thick chain, at the end of which was a gigantic iron ball the size of a child. Upon reaching his position, the giant tugged at the chains, finally bringing the iron ball to where he was. He then looked at Kino and spoke up in a voice at least as loud as the cheering,

""Hey, hey, what's this? This little brat is my first opponent?""

""I am, yes. Before the round, I have two questions I'd like to ask you. First, for what purpose did you come to this country?""

To Kino's question, the giant responded with a questioning expression, ""What?""

""I asked, for what purpose did you come to this country?""

""What are you, stupid? I've come here to kill all of you and become a citizen, of course.""

The giant said in an exasperated tone. Kino nodded in acknowledgement, then said,

""Second question. Won't you surrender?""

""Come again?""

""If you surrender now, you'll be able to get out of here unharmed.""

The giant, taken aback, did not provide an answer. Seizing his chain and pulling the iron ball toward himself, he then began to swing it. Slowly at first, then gradually faster. The iron ball whizzed through the air above the giant's head.

Kino shrugged, right hand tapping lightly on Canon.

Before long, the audience quietened down.

PUU~~UN!

A resonance of trumpets, however lacking in energy, signaled commencement of the round.

""DIEEEE!!""

Almost simultaneously with the giant's shout, every muscle in his body bulked up. The iron ball swung forth, aimed right at Kino, but never hit its mark. It instead flew in a completely different direction, drawing a clean parabolic arc in the sky, then squashing a burnt-out car which served as its landing spot.

""......""

The giant, clueless as to what had just happened, looked at what remained of the chain in his hands for a short while. Hauling the end of it toward himself, he then observed that it had been beautifully severed.

""Uh--um...""

He muttered while looking at Kino. In Kino's right hand was Canon, still smoking. For some reason or another, the giant, his expression signifying that the situation had finally sunk in, pointed at the end of the chain and asked Kino,

""You shot it?""

And Kino answered,

""I shot it, yes.""

Then, the giant pointed into the distance, at the spot where the iron ball had landed.

""And it flew over there?""

""It totally flew over there, yes. Could you please surrender?""

Asked as such by Kino, the giant immediately answered,

""Apologies. I'll go with that.""

===

""My, my. Uhyu... So I'm up against a little brat. Uhy-hyu...""

Amid the twilight, Kino was faced with the second opponent, who said more or less the same greeting as the giant from the first round, disregarding the addition of creepy laughing. This time, the participant was a young man of thin physique and tall stature, whose purple hair stood up like cockscomb.

He held no weapons in his hands. His body, both upper and lower, was clothed in tight black garment. A large number of metal blades were stuck to his abdomen.

Each of the thin metal blades possessed about the same length as his palms. They were bent, albeit only slightly, in the middle. Clinging tightly to his body, it seemed as if they were his scales, or perhaps a strip of armor.

Kino stared at those metal blades for a moment, prioritizing them over the opponent himself.

The man thereupon picked off one of those bits and threw it away to his side. The metal bit spun through the air, then made an abrupt turn, starting back to where it came. The man reached for his back with his left arm, then stretched it straight out from his body. From his wrist to his left ankle, a swath of cloth spread forth, as if it was a wing of a momonga.

He then crossed his legs, taking one elegant step to the right. The returning metal bit hit the cloth and stuck, as if being sucked right in. The man tapped on his right shoulder with his left hand, then tapped the cloth over his abdomen with his right. When he spread out his arms once again, the metal bit could be seen, fitted back right where it once was.

""Uhy-hyu... Did you see that? These handmade throwing blades of mine all return to their original place.""

Kino put up a light scowl, then abruptly spoke up,

""Please surrender. I'll accept it.""

""Now, that's not going to happen. How about you surrender? Well, not that I'll accept it until you're dead though. Uhy-hy-hy-hyu...""

The man laughed while giving his answer. He pressed both his hands against his abdomen in a grasping gesture. He then bent slightly forward, raising only his head up to glare at Kino.

Kino's right hand tapped on Canon.

PUU~~UN!

Trumpets resounded.

Right that moment, the man plucked off a metal blade with his right hand and flicked it at Kino. His hand then returned to his abdomen, grabbing and throwing more blades in succession. He did so such speed that made it impossible for one to track his hands by eye.

Kino ran to the right, dodging the blades. To the side, the metal blades spun, narrowly flying past with ferocious speed. The man kept on throwing, this time aiming at Kino's right.

The man refrained from throwing all that he had, leaving about half of them clinging to his abdomen. He shook his hips back and forth, shouting taunts with an ominous voice.

""Uhyuu~! Right when what I just threw turn back, I'll be throwing the rest! Let's see if you can dodge them coming from both sides!""

Kino took a quick glance to the rear, observing that the metal blades were turning in midair.

""DIE!""

Simultaneously with his scream, the man repeatedly threw all but one of what he had left.

The metal blades flew straight for Kino.

Kino lightly shook head, then dropped faced down, flat on the ground.

""Nu-huh--!?""

The man exclaimed in a strange voice.

""If they're sure to return to you, then they're also sure to never hit the ground, aren't they?""

Kino said to no one in particular.

HY-HY-HY-HY-HY-HY-HY-HYUN!

And at the same time, the metal blades whistled past over Kino's head.

Then, right when the returning metal blades were caught by the man's cloth, Kino, still down on the ground, fired Canon.

Simultaneously with a thunderous roar and puff of white smoke, Kino's right arm sprung up.

The bullet struck the last remaining metal blade on the man, right on top of the pit of his stomach. The impact shocked the man to his core.

""GAH-HYOH--!""

That was all the man could utter as his eyes opened wide and his mouth gaped; he was immobilized for an instant. Then he staggered, half of his consciousness still hanging on. Kino, observing as he swayed around like a metronome, shot him in the side of his right thigh.

The moment he was hit, the man shuddered and fell over, bleeding from his leg.

The metal blades passed over him.

===

Kino returned to the room and lit a candle, as it had already turned gloomy by that time.

The traveler then put Canon and the Woodsman on the bed and took off the jacket. Canon was then disassembled and fitted with a new cylinder.

""Ah-huh... Oh, it's just Kino. When'd you get back?""

Hermes, who had been sound asleep, asked in a voice that was still not quite awake.

While assembling Canon, Kino said,

""Just now. We're staying here tonight, by the way.""

""Eh, figures. Well, more sleep it is, then.""

And so Hermes fell into slumber once more.

===

The next day, Kino woke at the break of dawn.

The room had turned gloomy once more, but the sun rose soon enough, giving just enough illumination to the vicinity.

Kino cleaned Canon's cylinder that had been fired the day before and loaded it with new bullets.

Eating portable rations for breakfast, Kino then did some light exercises to limber up the muscles. Shortly afterward, it was training with the Woodsman, and after that, with Canon.

A little while later, the soldier finally came to call the participants.

Hermes was sleeping all the while.

===

""......""

Kino's first opponent for day two looked at the traveler without uttering a word.

He was an elderly man of sturdy physique and short stature. His light brown hair and beard were so long and full that one would not be able to tell where their ends were, and his face was covered in wrinkles.

He wore a baggy and slightly filthy robe. He seemed to be carrying something on his back, since there was an odd bulge right there beneath the robe. For some reason, he was carrying a gilded trombone under his arms, holding it with great care. There was nothing else in his hands.

A homeless man who carried all of his household goods on his back, performing in back alleys for a living. That was the impression he gave off.

Kino looked at him for a while, then called out loudly,

""If you would like to surrender, I have all the intention to accept it, sir.""

""......""

The man gave no reply. Keeping silent, he lightly waved his right hand.

Kino's right hand tapped on Canon's grip.

PUU~~UN!

Simultaneously with the sound of trumpets, the man poised his trombone with terrific vigor, pointing its bell at Kino. Kino, too, drew out Canon right when the trumpets sounded, firing a shot.

The bullet struck the trombone's bell, knocking it away to the right. Right then, from the hole where the sounds of music would normally emerge, a lukewarm gelatinous liquid of purple coloration spewed out instead. It burst into flames almost instantly as it flew through the air in a parabola, completing in an arch of fire.

The arch then faded away, as if the fire was jumping off the trombone's bell, landing on the ground in a fiery puddle.

""I knew it was special... A flamethrower, huh.""

Kino said, left hand reaching for the backside of the waist belt, drawing out the Woodsman. Its safety was turned off, and its aim was locked on to the man's head. Kino fired a shot, intentionally missing the mark by a small margin.

The persuader rang a dry plosive sound. Its slide shifted backward then back forward at an intense speed, the empty cartridge was flicked out, and a new one was loaded in its place.

The moment the bullet whizzed past the man's face, he once again pointed his trombone at his opponent-- at Kino. With a stern look in his eyes, however surrounded by wrinkles, the man poised for action, exerting strength onto his whole body.

PU-PU-PU-PSSH~~, a miserable sound reverberated right then as a geyser of purple gushed up from the man's right shoulder.

""?""

Dyed in purple by the liquid that had rained down, the man was overcome with surprise. Kino, with the Woodsman in left hand and Canon in the right, addressed him,

""I shot the hidden hose on your shoulder. The hole may be small, but any more pressure and it will explode. You will surrender now, won't you, sir?""

""......""

The man closely observed the state of his own body. He continued doing so for a short while, before speaking up in a deep voice,

""I refuse.""

""You no longer have a way to win this.""

Kino said to the man while aiming at him with the Woodsman. The man glared back at his opponent without so much as a quiver.

""Kill me.""

""Pardon?""

""I said kill me.""

When Kino was about to say something, a voice from the spectator seat yelled,

""Finish him! Kill him!""

The others in the audience then started to shout, one after another.

KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL HIM! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL HIM NOW! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! SHOOT HIM! KILL! KILL!

Kino slowly turned, looking at the audience as they screamed gleefully, as if they have turned mad. Then, all of a sudden, a shot from Canon was fired up into the air. Simultaneously with the explosive roar, the entirety of the spectator seatings instantly fell silent.

Kino then took a look at the royal box seat, in which the king was seated.

As usual, the king was clothed in gaudy attire, sitting high up and looking down at Kino, with a sneer painted on his face. As their eyes met, Kino returned a glare hidden under a well-mannered smile.

The elderly man interrupted,

""What are you doing? Hurry and shoot me. In a fight to the death, the winner lives, and the loser dies. That has always been the way of my life. I've killed hundreds. And I've lost this contest. That is why I will die, and you, li'l miss, will live on.""

Kino produced a wry smile, saying,

""Now, sir, li'l miss is a tad bit awkward, so I'll have to ask you to drop it. I'm Kino.""

""Kino, eh. A good name. I'll remember to take that with me to the afterlife.""

""Why, thank you...""

While saying so, Kino strode up to the man, stopped just in front of him, pointed Canon against his forehead, then cocked the hammer with the thumb,

CLINK

""Please surrender.""

""No.""

""So I'm left with no choice, then.""

Kino pulled the trigger.

The hammer was slowly lowered back in place with a press of the thumb. The man looked up at Kino in a dubious expression, and Kino grinned back at him.

The next moment, Kino abruptly spun Canon around, clutching it on the long barrel instead. With the movement of a backhand slap, the persuader, grip faced to its wielder's right, walloped the man on his temple.

That made short work of the situation-- almost instantaneous.

The man, unable to utter a word, toppled over to his right, unconscious.

===

""A cutie like you is my opponent? What in the world were your other opponents even doing?""

The second opponent for day two-- the semi-final round, in other words-- confronted Kino and spoke bluntly.

A young woman with long, blonde hair pulled back and tied together, she was a beauty of sharp facial features and tall stature.

She wore a camp shirt and cargo pants, giving off the impression of a military outfit. Over her shirt was a vest covered in little pouches. Pouches were also attached to the thighs of her pants, these ones of the deep type, seemingly for storing bundles of long, narrow objects.

Gripped in her left hand was a persuader, a rifle type with wooden stock. It was a bolt-action model, meaning after each shot, the ejecting of spent cartridges and the loading of new bullets had to be done manually.

The magazine could be seen protruding out slightly in front of the gunlock. Other than that part, the persuader was of a slim silhouette, making it look more like a pole.

""They must have been careless.""

""Aha-ha, they probably did. I use that trick all the time, too.""

Kino asked,

""Is becoming a citizen your goal?""

""Me? It is, yeah. You know why?""

As Kino denied knowing so, the woman suddenly declared in a tone of wild enthusiasm,

""A while ago, when I was in the area, I found this suu~per cute boy at the edge of the forest! I'm going to make him mine, no matter what!""

Kino was taken aback. And it showed conspicuously on the face.

""It's the thing they call womanly nature, I suppose. You understand, don't you?""

""...No.""

""Oh, that so?""

Still in an expression of mixed feelings, Kino asked,

""...Um, I'm pretty sure you'll refuse, but could you please surrender?""

""Hey, that's my line.""

The reply came without so much as a moment's delay.

""So it's futile, as I thought...""

Kino muttered, right hand tapping on Canon.

The woman pulled her persuader's bolt open. Then, from the pouch on her chest, she produced a stripper clip of five long ammunition cartridges. She inserted them into the chamber, all in one go. Then she removed the clip, closed the bolt, and loaded the first shot.

PUU~~UN!

Right as the trumpets sounded, both participants broke away from each other, dashing for the junk heaps behind them. They then dove for cover behind those heaps. The woman quickly found refuge behind a heap of scrapped iron components, assumed a half-crouching stance, then pointed her long persuader forward, holding it firmly.

She then breathed in quickly, exhaled only a little bit of it, then held her breath. Aiming at the core of the junk heap which Kino had hidden behind, she fired a shot.

Together with a long, sharp plosive sound, the woman bent backwards in recoil. From the first junk heap, Kino jumped behind another heap to the side. The bullet pierced through the heap which Kino had hidden behind previously, tearing its way to the spot where Kino had been just seconds ago.

The woman could see Kino leaping away from the heap which she had shot at.

""You're pretty good.""

CLINK! The woman operated the rifle bolt with intense speed, ejecting the spent cartridge and loading the next.

""Armor-piercing bullets, huh.""

Kino muttered, left hand drawing out the Woodsman and flicking off the safety. Cautiously, but also swiftly, Kino circled around to the woman's right side, heading for another cover.

Slowly peeking out from below a slab of iron plating, Kino caught a glint of the woman's golden hair. Kino then dove to the neighboring rubble, a strip of stone wall. Right when the traveler lied face down-- BAKOW! The sound of a bullet could be heard as it drilled right through the stone.

BAKOW! BAKOW! BAKOW!

The woman fired three more shots in succession, with all the intention to get rid of Kino, an obstacle to her goal. With each hit, the collective mass of stone wavered.

Staying down, Kino then caught sight of a fist-sized rocks rolling on the ground in close proximity.

The woman, still holding her persuader firmly, picked out a new ammunition clip and loaded it in. When she took aim and prepared to continue firing, she felt an acute pain run through her head.

""Ouch--!""

As the woman looked up, she could see a rock flying at her, right before her eyes. She dodged in a panic, but it still managed to struck her shoulder. More rocks followed, falling in rapid succession. The woman did not stay put, rushing to the mountain of scrapped metal diagonally in front of her and crouching down.

As she placed her left hand on her head, blood ran down from under her golden hair.

""Damn--!""

The woman, in a brief fit of anger, carelessly poked her head out of cover and pointed her persuader, only to withdraw right back down in a hurry as she saw that Kino was aiming right at her.

Kino did not shoot, instead running while still keeping steady aim on the woman, then hiding behind a heap of furniture and building wreckage-- chairs, desks, window frames, and doors.

Sweat and a single line of blood ran down the woman's forehead, and she wiped them off with her hand.

Kino shouted a question to the woman,

""Can you hear me? Are you sure you won't surrender?""

""Very funny! Don't you dare underestimate women!""

""In this short range, that persuader puts you at a disadvantage.""

""......""

That was the woman's reply.

Crouching with back against a metal door in the junk heap, Kino sighed, left hand's grip on the Woodsman tightening. Sweat appeared on Kino's forehead, too, with one drop trickling down the cheek. Kino muttered,

""Winning without killing really is hard, Master.""

Meanwhile, the woman pulled out her persuader's bolt, as per the disassembly procedure. From the pocket on the backside of her waist, she took out a cylindrical component and inserted it into where the bolt once was. It fitted into the chamber perfectly, as if it had always been there before. Then, from the pouch on one of her thighs, the woman took out a long, narrow magazine. Then, she grinned.

Kino peeped through the lower left corner of the junk heap and checked what was happening ahead. Looking at the mountain of scrapped metal which the woman has been hiding behind, Kino shot the topmost lump of metal with the Woodsman. GAAN! The scrap rang with a satisfying sound and fell to the other side, bringing other pieces on the heap crumbling down along with it.

The woman held her persuader under her arms and leapt out, and while holding it in that manner, fired a shot. Kino had intended to jump out of cover immediately when the woman fired a shot, but stopped the decision in a hurry, taken by surprise upon hearing the comparatively short roar of the shot and the comparatively light impact of the bullet.

For about three seconds, an uninterrupted stream of bullets streaked forth. They landed and kicked up the dirt right beside Kino, who now laid low on the ground.

""Wh-what the--?""

Kino rolled to the right edge of the junk heap and slowly peeked out.

The woman could be seen under a new cover, two heaps apart from where Kino was. Her persuader had a new component sticking out of it: a long, narrow magazine, slanted to the right.

""Now that's a first.""

Kino blurted out while withdrawing back into cover. The persuader, which had been fired and loaded manually up until moments ago, had suddenly turned into an automatic type capable of firing tens of uninterrupted shots.

A strategy would be to wait for her to fire all she had, then approach her while shooting continuously, forcing her to surrender without giving her enough time to reload, but,

""That's unreliable...""

Kino muttered. At the same time, a storm of bullets assaulted the right side of the junk heap. As chips of scrap metal danced and fluttered about, Kino retreated to the middle of the heap.

The woman pulled her magazine, which still had a few shots left, and loaded in a new one. She revealed herself from cover in an imposing stance, held her persuader in a half-crouching posture, and slowly approached the rubble which Kino was hiding behind. Then, she said,

""You've done well, persisting this long. Big sis here is going to wrap things up for you. I won't shoot anymore, so come on out. I'll accept your surrender.""

""Oh, really...""

Kino's reply came from the opposite side of the junk heap. Training her aim on the right side of the heap, while also keeping a cautious glare on the left, the woman walked slowly to her right.

Mere seconds later, the woman suddenly opened fire and circled around to the back of the heap, charging in head-on. Bullets, spent shells, and plosive sounds scattered and filled the air.

Kino was nowhere to be seen behind the rubble which she had sprayed bullets at. Instead, a door was there, stood up slantwise. Several bullets had struck the door, and all of them bounced off.

Within a split-second, the woman came to the conclusion that Kino had circled around to the other side. She held her fire, and as she was about to turn around,

""?""

She noticed that a person's hand was sticking out one side of the door, gripping a hand persuader. And on the other side, half of a person's face was peeking out diagonally, one of those large eyes looking right at her.

""LIIIAARRR~~""

Kino said, seemingly enjoying it. The woman was painted in an expression of astonishment.

Together with dry string of plosive sounds, the Woodsman fired off three bullets, all piercing the woman's right shoulder. The woman's persuader dropped from her hands.

Keeping steady aim on the woman, Kino emerged from behind the door.

Hmph, the woman briefly sneered. Then, she shook her head, saying,

""Looks like I have no choice, so... I surrender.""

""Thank you very much.""

As Kino said that, the woman, blood dripping from her head and shoulder, asked with a smile,

""Hey, you're even cuter up close. Want to do something nice with me later?""

===

When Kino returned to the room, Hermes, sleeping as usual, woke up to the rustling sound.

Kino was carrying a heavy-looking paper bag.

""Welcome back, Kino. Good to see you safe. What's that, by the way? You lost and got a participation award or something?""

While carefully lowering the paper bag onto the bed, Kino said,

""Nope. These are the things I need for tomorrow.""

""Oh dear...""

From the paper bag, Kino took out a bottle of green fluid. It was the same liquid propellant that Canon used for firing. Then, a small cardboard box was taken out. It contained .44 caliber bullets. They had hollow-pointed tips, gouged in quite like a volcano's caldera.

From the luggage, Kino produced a small portable stove, put in several chunks of solid fuel, and lit a fire. Then, after washing a cup usually used and for drinking tea, Kino poured some liquid propellant into it put it over the flame.

""What're you doing there, Kino?""

Kino, carefully handing the process, answered Hermes without turning around,

""Concentrating the propellant.""

""Playing with fire? That's dangerous. What for?""

When the cup's contents started to thicken, Kino removed it from the fire, poured in even more liquid propellant, then put it back over the flame.

""Doing this makes the propellant more dense, increasing the power of its explosion. The bullet's initial velocity, too.""

As Kino gently stirred the contents of the cup, the liquid propellant started to boil down until it was dense as starch syrup. The washstand was then filled with water, and the cup's bottom was put in it to cool down. The propellant's viscosity and dullness of color further increased, turning into an almost solid, dark green paint.

Then, Kino reached for a bullet. One of hollow-point type, which prioritized destructive power over pure penetration. For that purpose, the bullet would burst apart and expand as it hit its target. Because it had a hole in the middle, its rims were thin.

Kino took only one bullet, carefully filling up the hole at its tip with concentrated liquid propellant. Leaving some space at the top, Kino then closed the hole with regular liquid propellant and topped it with a percussion cap.

Next, Kino took out some epoxy putty. It was normally used for mending damage to Hermes' parts, such as screw heads and bolt holes, and it would possess a fair level of solidity when dried and hardened.

Kino mixed putties A and B together, taking care to keep them in proper proportions. Then, the mixture was gently applied to the tip of the bullet, over the percussion cap which had just been placed on.

The tip of the bullet, formerly a caldera, was now beautifully molded into a cone, turning it into a stratovolcano. Kino then incised a deep cross into it with a knife. Soon after, the putty dried.

""Done!""

Kino raised up the handmade bullet, happy as a child.

By this time, Hermes was already sound asleep.

===

On the morning of the third day in this country, Kino woke at the break of dawn.

First things first, the Woodsman was dismantled, cleaned, and reloaded, then it was practice, as always.

After having only an adequate amount of breakfast, Kino spoke to the soldier assigned to the room, asking for materials containing information on the country's history and laws.

""Here y'go.""

Brought a book by the soldier, Kino read it in all its minute details.

===

Regarding seven years prior...

The previous king, loved dearly for his strict policies, had been assassinated by his son, or in other words, the current king. With a particularly brutal method.

It seemed that the current king had loathed for a long time his father and the strictness of his ways. On a particular occasion, the frustration he had bottled up for many years finally erupted. He eliminated all who opposed his actions. It was a massacre which had taken most of those who had the former king's blood. Brothers and sisters, uncle and aunts, the whole household, all slaughtered.

He had not killed his own wife, but she was overcome with grief and committed suicide. Both his children were exiled, their whereabouts unknown. A theory has it that they had been killed, and a rumor has it that they were imprisoned underground to this day.

He then crowned himself king, beginning to lead a life of debauchery and imposing arbitrary laws onto this naturally bountiful and blessed country. He encouraged the citizens, who had lived diligent and simple lives up until then, to change their ways.

There seemed to have been some resistance among the masses. They adjusted quickly to the pleasure-seeking lifestyle, however, and before long, most of the people had come to love their present king dearly. What half-hearted creatures.

And now, back to the present...

===

By the time Hermes woke up, which was almost noon, Kino was summoned to the final round.

Kino fitted Canon with an empty cylinder and loaded one of the chambers with concentrated liquid propellant, cramming in twice the usual amount. Then, without putting in felt padding, Kino loaded in the handmade bullet-- the one which had been made last night.

Using an empty .44 caliber cartridge, Kino pushed the rim of the bullet, fitting it into the cylinder.

Then, to the chamber opposite to the one that was loaded, only several sheets of padding were applied, pushed in with the plunger.

A single percussion cap was fixed to the chamber containing the bullet.

""What do you think you're doing, Kino? With how you set it up, you can only fire once.""

Kino smiled, saying ""It's fine this way,"" then rotated the one-shot cylinder and put Canon into its holster.

Next, Kino loaded all of the luggage onto Hermes, secured them firmly, then hung the coat on top.

""Alright, let's go. I'd like you to watch this round closely, Hermes.""

Hermes, now down from the stand, was pushed along as Kino left the room.

""Why?""

""So that we can leave this no-shower country right when it's all over.""

Kino said, seemingly delighted.

===

Amid the roar of applause, Kino strode to the center of the colosseum. Behind the traveler, Hermes, used as a coat hanger, could be seen left standing at the field's entranceway. Above the motorrad was the tiered platforms of the spectator seats. At its center, right in front, the king could be seen sipping alcohol while seated in an arrogant manner.

When Kino had reached the center, the final opponent emerged from the opposite side. Kino carefully observed the man as he walked toward the clearing.

The man was a young one, likely in his early twenties. He was of tall stature, his build well-proportioned. His hair was of the same black as Kino's. He wore blue jeans and a green sweater with cloth padding on the shoulders and elbows.

Kino's eyes met with the man's. His expression was completely different from that of the previous opponents. Although he was about to take part in a battle, he was somehow perfectly calm, his smile giving off an air of kindness-- As if he was a martyr making his way up the gallows.

His only weapon was the katana on his waist, its scabbard tucked in his belt.

===

""S'cuse me, mister.""

Hermes called out to the middle-aged soldier who also standing there at the entranceway.

""What?""

""That friendly-looking katana guy is the final opponent?""

""Yeah, that's right. He'd flawlessly won all his fights up 'till now. Anyone can see that he's one tough customer. Your partner is pretty good too, but things might get dangerous this time.""

Hermes, not particularly surprised, said,

""Hm~m.""

""That's it? Just a 'hm~m'? You're not even worried about your partner or what?""

The soldier posed the question reflexively.

""Worry? Worrying won't make Kino any stronger.""

""You're a cold one, you know that?""

""Now, it'll probably be fine... But putting the match aside, it looks like Kino is cooking up some unpleasant scheme. I'm more worried about that, I guess.""

""What?""

At the time, the soldier was clueless as to what Hermes was saying.

===

""I am called Shizu.""

The man with the katana confronted Kino and declared his name. His tone was polite, with beautiful pronunciation to boot.

""I'm Kino.""

Kino replied.

""Kino, I see. I have a request to make, if you don't mind.""

""What might that be?""

Shizu said the same words Kino had said four times before.

""I'd like you to surrender; right here, right now. I will accept, of course.""

Kino, mildly surprised, asked,

""You want to become a citizen, Shizu?""

""Yes... I want to be.""

""Of this cesspool of a country?""

This time it was Shizu who was taken by surprise; he stood there staring at Kino for a short while. Although he had a piercing look in his eyes, it was not to the degree of being a glare.

""Now this is surprising. You know that, yet you still participated this fiasco of a contest? Not to mention winning all the way to the final round... It's not for the sake of becoming a citizen, is it?""

""Yes, it's not. But what about you? What's your story?""

Shizu averted his gaze, thought about some things for a moment, then looked back at Kino in the eyes. He then calmly spoke up,

""There is something I absolutely have to do, and for that, I have to become a citizen... Again, I'd like you to surrender.""

""I don't really get where you're coming from, but I refuse.""

Kino said, decisively.

""Why? You don't even want to become a citizen, so why do you fight?""

Shizu asked, his expression suggesting that he couldn't comprehend the response he received.

""It's nothing complicated. I want to fight; right here, right now. That is why.""

Kino said, lightly tapping Canon in its right thigh holster.

As if giving up, Shizu shook his head, then looked back for a moment at the entranceway where he came out of.

With the thumb of his left hand, he soundlessly extracted his katana from its scabbard. With his right hand, he gripped the hilt, then unsheathed.

The silver blade revealed its form. Shizu gripped its hilt with both hands.

PUU~~UN!

Trumpets resounded.

Kino slowly drew out the Woodsman, unlocked the safety, then locked the aim on Shizu. But the shot was not fired.

Shizu held his ground. He held up his katana at middle stance, the blade only slightly angled. The air of gentleness he’d seemed to possess mere moments before had vanished. Tension filled the air around him, as if his body and his katana had been melded into a single weapon.

Shizu took one step toward Kino. Then another.

Kino fired one shot with the Woodsman. The bullet passed well to the side of Shizu’s head. Without so much as a flinch, Shizu let it pass, then took another step.

Kino fired again, this time aiming just barely to the side of Shizu's head. Still unfazed, Shizu let the bullet get a close shave on his ear, then took another step.

Kino let out a brief sigh, then aimed at Shizu's right shoulder. Shizu immediately held up his blade, aligning it with Kino's line of aim.

""!""

Kino, taken by surprise, pulled the trigger. The bullet struck the blade and was thrown off course, slanting to the back.

""Whoa.""

As if it was someone else's problem, Kino was upfront in showing admiration for Shizu, all the while firing off several more shots, meant for the man's hands and legs.

Shizu handled his blade swiftly and smoothly, knocking each of the bullets away to his sides.

Then, he took another step.

===

""Y'see that, motorrad? That's how awesome he is.""

The middle-aged soldier said to Hermes, seemingly rooting for the man.

""Huh... Swiping bullets with a katana is pretty awesome, yeah. Is he able to tell when Kino's about to shoot or something?""

""He's probably looking at his opponents' aim and the movement of their eyes and fingers. Also beat persuader users like that in the last two rounds.""

""Cool. I've always questioned whether or not this world is beautiful, but it's vast one, that's for sure.""

Hermes expressed frankly the fact of being surprised. The soldier assumed a know-it-all persona, saying,

""You could say that he's the kind of guy who doesn't... respond to persuasions.""

""You a poet or what, mister?""

""Heh heh,"" the middle-aged soldier let out an awkward chuckle back at Hermes' snark, then continued,

""But really, I wonder why he hasn't killed anybody.""

""Come again?""

""He hasn't killed anybody. Handed out cuts an brusises like candy, though. Like your partner, now that I mention it. Fired shots, but never killed. It's unheard of, having both participants come all the way to the last round without killing anybody. What are they even thinking?""

The soldier spoke in a tone indistinguishable between admiration and disgust.

""What are they even thinking, indeed...""

As Hermes muttered so, several roars of persuader shot echoed.

===

Kino had now fired eight shots without hitting Shizu once. The Woodsman's magazine, with two bullets remaining in it, was dropped off, and a new one with ten was loaded in.

Shizu was now standing right before Kino.

""Could you please surrender?""

Shizu said calmly, while holding up his katana at middle stance.

""I would rather not.""

Kino answered, aim locked onto Shizu's blade. This wasn't done deliberately, but rather because the blade followed wherever Kino's aim went.

Kino fired a shot. The bullet was deflected.

Right then, Shizu rushed forward, closing the gap between them in an instant.

""Hah--!""

Wielding the katana in only his right hand, Shizu sliced diagonally upward from his bottom left with tremendous speed. The top of the blade struck the Woodsman's barrel, flinging it from Kino's left hand.

With his left hand, Shizu immediately reached up for the katana's hilt, then soundlessly reversed the blade. Now gripping the hilt with both hands, he swept downward, aiming for Kino's left shoulder.

Right when the Woodsman was knocked away, Kino poised for defense, slightly bending down the left knee, made a cross guard with both arms overhead, then took one step toward Shizu.

CLANK!

Kino held the cross guard up high, catching the blunt-edged overhead slash at the spot the blade met its hilt. Sparks scattered upon impact.

""What the--?""

Just as Shizu blurted out a short reaction, Kino shoved his blade aside with a swing of the left arm, then spun around to his right flank. Riding on the momentum, Kino slammed Shizu's temple with the heel of the right palm.

While staggering to his right side from the impact of the hook, Shizu used his right hand to swing his katana at Kino's side. There was not much force put into the attack, enabling Kino to cast it aside with a swing of the left arm. A metallic chime rang upon impact.

Shizu took two steps back, promptly regained his bearings, then held up his katana once again at middle stance.

Kino poised for defense, assuming a defensive stance with right foot stepping back and arms guarding both sides.

Kino then briefly loosened up, shaking both arms lightly as if they'd gone to sleep.

A metallic surface could be seen peeking from beneath the cuts on the jacket. Something had been put under its sleeves.

""You're good. I can see that you are well-versed in the art of persuasion. That's a surprise.""

Shizu reversed his katana, turning its sharp edge in Kino's direction.

""But I would really prefer that you surrender soon.""

Shizu said without even a slight movement, holding his katana firmly.

Kino stood still and lowered both arms naturally, then replied,

""I refuse.""

""When I become a citizen, I could make a law that makes you a citizen, too.""

""I would rather you not do that. I have no interest in becoming a citizen, after all.""

""Ah, right. But if we keep going, you'll die.""

While his eyes were glaring at Kino, Shizu spoke to the traveler with a gentle tone.

In opposition, Kino spoke in jest,

""Truth be told... In this country, I haven't killed anyone up till now.""

Shizu pulled a wry face.

""Huh... So what?""

""So you see...""

Kino produced a smile, then continued in a tone of amusement,

""I figured I'd kill at least one person-- To end it all with a bang.""

""......""

Shizu did not answer. Instead, he stared at Kino, with the look in his eyes seeming to show sympathy.

Kino looked back at Shizu, with the look in those eyes suggesting enjoyment and liveliness, as if finally coming across a long-awaited individual among a bustling crowd.

Shizu suddenly moved forward. Closing the distance between them in an instant, he brandished his weapon overhead. Kino smiled, albeit faintly, right hand reaching for Canon and drawing it out.

In an instant, both sides froze all movement.

Kino had pointed Canon at Shizu just before he could bring down his katana.

Seeing that the persuader's hammer had already been raised, Shizu knew full well that a light pull on the trigger would blow a large hole in his chin. The man whispered,

""You're quick...""

""I just have to calm down and look closely to know where a slash is coming from. Way easier than you telling where a persuader is being aimed at. After that, I only have to be quicker on the draw.""

""......""

""You're too obsessed with winning. It might be imprudent of me to say this, but contests exist for the purpose of having fun. Not for the purpose of killing.""

While fixated on Shizu's expression, Kino said, as if admonishing him. The masking front of strength faded from Shizu's face, returning to the calmness which Kino had seen in the beginning.

Shizu, keeping his upper stance, spoke up,

""...It's over. I've lost. So what now? Will you accept my surrender? Or am I to die here?""

""Neither of those.""

Receiving an immediate reply, Shizu noticed that Kino's expression had changed abruptly. Kino's lips was still locked in a smile, but that gaze was surely not laughing together with it.

Kino's left hand reached under Canon's barrel and pulled down the loading lever, folding the mechanism just like when loading a bullet. Felt paddings had been crammed into the chamber's bottommost chamber. As if to squash them, Kino folded the mechanism hard.

At the same time, Kino's right hand pushed Canon from the back. As if being clamped tight, the persuader was held perfectly still between both of Kino's hands.

""What... are you doing?""

Just as Shizu asked that, a shout came echoing from the spectator seatings, ""THAT'S ENOUGH! KILL HIM!"" And before long, more followed, weaving into a chorus,

KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL!

Expression unchanged, Kino approached Shizu while still keeping aim on him, then edged slightly to the left.

""What are you waiting for? If you're going to kill me, then...""

Kino shifted the aim to Shizu's throat, whole body bracing for impact. As their eyes met, Kino asked a question, as if throwing out a child's riddle,

""Who's there behind you?""

""What? Eh--? Ah--! You... No way...""

Kino shouted,

""Get down!""

""!""

Shizu folded down on his knees, and Kino pulled Canon's trigger.

The hammer struck the percussion cap. The liquid propellant, with explosive power raised as much as it could have been, ignited, sending the bullet off to squeeze its way forward. The bullet leapt from the barrel, diving through the hoop between Shizu's arms. The discharge created a white shockwave, blasting right at Shizu's face. The impact knocked him backward in a somersault.

Kino was thrown backward as well, both shoulders aching from the recoil.

The bullet headed straight for the royal box seat in the center of the tiered platforms, just as Kino had intended it to. Spearheaded with putty, the bullet hit the glass, which was not all that thick, and pierced right through. The glass shattered to pieces, its countless fragments tumbling down like a waterfall.

The force of impact broke the bullet's pointed tip apart into four pieces, just according to how it was incised.

The remainder of the bullet continued toward the man seated in the middle seat-- the one who wore the crown-- entering his mouth and striking his upper jaw. 

It pierced his skin, pulverized his bones, tore through his flesh, and entered his head.

The bullet's rim crunched, as if turned inside-out. The shock then reached the percussion cap. A small spark flew, igniting the concentrated liquid propellant.

The king's head exploded.

His face spread forth, scattering into countless bits of flesh.

From both sides of his temporal region, a mixture of his shredded skull, ear flesh, and brain tissue gushed out. The scalp of the back of his head ruptured, hair and all, blowing his crown backward.

Blood, brain matter, and bundles of hair painted a whole new stinking design on the dresses of those sitting near him.

Everything from the king's jaw up had completely disappeared, leaving only what one would identify as his tongue and the row of teeth on his lower jaw.

===

Sent tumbling back by the shockwave, Shizu witnessed an inverted scene of the king's head rupturing behind the downpour of glass shards. What he saw next was a sphere of deep red instantly engulfing on the whole royal box. Then, his head and back landed heavily on the floor.

As the red mist cleared, Shizu realized that the king of this country had been murdered by the bullet that Kino fired; he knew before anyone else did, Kino included.

""My goodness...""

Shizu whispered. He felt a sharp pain run through his head, suffering a spell of dizziness.

And so he kept still, pretending to be unconscious.

===

The spectators silenced their chorus after Kino had fired the shot; they needed some time to process what had just happened. Some of them heard a shriek from the royal box, from which the occupants could be seen rushing out of while vomiting.

Before long, the realization of the king's death swept across the spectator platforms like the children's game of Telephone.

Meanwhile, Kino put the clattering Canon into its holster and picked up the Woodsman. Making sure that it was not damaged, it was then holstered as well.

Clueless as to what they should be doing, all of the spectators simply murmured among themselves.

Kino looked around once at the whole spectating crowd, spread both arms out wide, and proceeded to declare,

""Everyone! It is regrettable, but his majesty the king has passed away from a stray bullet! I offer my condolences! That said, I have won the contest! I have become a citizen! And with privilege of a victor, I shall declare my new law! Without a king, this country will have no order! Therefore, I see that it is necessary to decide on a new king! Starting now, everyone in this country shall participate in a country-wide contest! The last one left standing will be the new king! Those who do not fight will be stripped of their citizenship the moment they leave the country! This is the new law!""

For a brief moment, the whole colosseum fell dead silent.

A very brief moment indeed.

===

Kino walked to the entranceway, where Hermes was. Shizu was still down on the ground, and Kino kicked his shoulder while on the way.

""That hurt...""

""I beg your pardon. I'll be leaving the country now, so if you want to be a citizen, do feel free.""

The colosseum was now wrapped up in roars and screams. Persuader shots could be heard all over.

As Kino reached where Hermes was,

""I knew you were up to something. Anyway, welcome back.""

The middle-aged soldier, who was next to Hermes, turned to Kino and spoke up,

""Y-you-- you're a great fighter, you know that? H-how-- how about join up with me? You can be the king. And I'll be the minister!""

While putting on the coat, Kino spoke back nonchalantly,

""I would rather not. We're leaving this country right now, after all.""

""Hey, mister. You'd better get out of here right now if you don't want to die.""

Kino started Hermes' engine.The rumble echoed from the concrete walls.

The soldier looked as if he was about to say something.

""Later, mister.""

But Hermes cut him off. Kino took off on the motorrad.

They ran off, and were gone in a blink of an eye.

===

Shizu climbed up the tier platforms one step at a time, moving on slowly. His expression was, for some reason, completely blank.

All over the place, brawls-- technically one-sided slaughters-- had broken out, without an end in sight. A man approached Shizu, who ignored everything and walked on absent-mindedly,

""You've got mad skills, man. If we fight together as partners, we'll have a great time, I'm sure! How about it?""

The man said, but Shizu ignored this too; he didn't even give the stranger a glance.

""Hey, get'im, boys!""

As the man said that, several minion-ish men wielding axes and metal pipes stepped forward, rushing at Shizu from both sides.

Shizu turned to his right and silently unsheathed his katana. He stabbed the man behind him over his left shoulder, and, on the return swing, cleaved the head of the man in front of him.

He ignored those who ran away. Still holding his katana, Shizu kept climbing the tiered platforms, and before long, he was stepping into the field of shattered glass.

As he set foot into the royal box, squishes could be heard as shreds of brain matter were trampled on.

Shizu regarded the king, still slumped in his chair, a head shorter than he used to be.

The king's loose tongue listlessly hung down, as if he was sticking his tongue out in a taunt.

Shizu smiled, albeit only faintly.

He let out a long, slow sigh.

And so he muttered,

""It has been a long time.""

===

Kino rode Hermes down a path in the forest.

When they came across a lake, Kino brought Hermes to a stop.

Getting down from Hermes, Kino sat down on the grass near the shore.

""It's beautiful.""

Hermes said, gazing at the serene waters. Its surface reflected the lush green forest and the blue sky. Kino threw a pebble, landing it in the water with a plop. Ripples spread out across the surface, ceasing shortly thereafter.

""Say, Kino...""

""What's up, Hermes?""

Hermes did not answer immediately. For a while, they let themselves be wrapped in the singing of birds.

Then, Hermes finally went on,

""A while ago-- well, a pretty long while ago... We met a couple in a horse-drawn carriage, didn't we?""

""...Yeah.""

Kino tossed another pebble.

""As I recall, they said there was a wonderful country in the vast forest to the west. And that they were headed there.""

""...That's what they said, yeah.""

""Then later, we met the wife again somewhere, didn't we? Just the wife, alone.""

""...Yeah.""

""If I'm not remembering wrong, the woman smiled at you and said, 'It was truly a wonderful country. You should make sure to visit it, Kino,' dind't she?""

""...Yeah. That's right.""

From somewhere nearby, Kino picked up a rock the size of a baby’s head and hurled it.

With a great splash, it sent inelegant ripples spreading across the lake surface, swaying and distorting the mirrored world.

Kino watched it.

But it didn't last forever; before long, the lake surface was back to how it once was-- back to being a tranquil mirror.

""Alright then...""

Kino stood up, dusted pants, and stared at the lake for another moment.

The reflection was of a thin face with unkempt black hair.

===

When Kino was about to get back on Hermes, the sound of an engine could be heard from afar.

""It's a Chenowth Buggy. Just one.""

Hermes identified it solely by its engine sound.

Suddenly, a low-riding dune buggy emerged from the forest, drawing to a stop in front of Kino and Hermes. Sitting in the driver's seat was Shizu. In the seat next to him was a big dog with thick, white fur. It was an adorable one indeed, with large, almond-shaped eyes and a face that seemed to be locked in a smile.

""Hey there, Kino.""

With a smile, Shizu called out from the driver's seat.

""Hello.""

Shizu cut his buggy's engine, took off his goggles, and got down from the vehicle, leaving his katana on his seat. He stood before Kino.

""I was hoping I'd see you again.""

""Is that so... It's too bad you couldn't become a citizen.""

""No, it's fine. That aside, I wanted to thank you.""

""Thank... me?""

Kino produced a dubious expression.

""Yes, that's right.""

Having said that, Shizu then bowed deeply,

""You did in my stead what I'd wanted to do when I become a citizen... For killing my father, you have my heartfelt gratitude.""

Then, while looking at Kino right in the eye,

""Thank you.""

""......""

Kino said nothing. Instead,

""You're a prince!?""

Hermes exclaimed.

""Was. Not anymore. Truth be told, I'd planned to win, and while I was being awarded my medal, to cut that man down right on the spot... For seven years, too. And thanks to you, Kino, now I've got free time on my hands.""

Shizu smiled awkwardly.

Kino said quietly,

""Revenge... It's so ludicrous.""

Shizu nodded lightly, still smiling.

""Yes, so ludicrous indeed.""

Both of them fell silent for a time.

===

""What will you be doing from now on?""

Kino asked Shizu, who was already back in his driver's seat.

""From now on, huh... I'll try wandering around until I find something I want to do. For the moment, we'll be heading north, I guess. All we've been to until now were cold places, you see. Isn't that right, Riku?""

He said, patting the dog sitting in the passenger's seat. It seemed to named Riku.

""If you say so, Master Shizu.""

Riku said. And right that moment,

""No way--!!"" Hermes exclaimed. ""The dog spoke! How!?""

Riku thereupon rose up in a conspicuous fit of the sulks, then retorted in a brusque expression,

""What was that? What's wrong with a talking dog? Pretty damn uppity for just a motorrad, aren't you?""

""Wh--? What'd you just say?""

""Hmph. You're just a vehicle that can't even run on your own. If you've got a problem, then why don't you try catching me yourself?""

Riku, still keeping up his cute face, threw out word after scathing word.

""Y-you're one to talk-- You can't even live without staying in a pack! Worse, you're born sick in the head, obsessed with trying to be leader! If you're got a problem, then bite me! Got the teeth to do it?""

Hermes, taking it all too seriously, launched a counteroffense.

""What's that, huh!?""

""Wanna go?""

""Stop it, Riku."" ""Enough already, Hermes.""

Shizu and Kino spoke up simultaneously. Riku, on the verge of leaping forward, sat right down and gave Kino a look of respect.

""I am called Riku, loyal servant of Master Shizu. I was honored to spectate your performance in the final round. Results aside, it was your doing that our matters were settled without Master Shizu being killed. Thank you very much.""

Kino smiled awkwardly, saying, 

""You're welcome.""

Then turned to Shizu and asked,

""He's cute. May I pet him?""

The master waved his hand, signaling a go-ahead.

Kino crouched to hug the dog, running both hands through his thick fur. In turn, Riku licked Kino's mouth and cheek.

Watching Riku enjoying Kino's hug, Hermes grumbled, albeit too quietly for anyone else to hear,

""Hmph. Damn pervy dog.""

Kino petted Riku for a moment, then took notice of something left lying around carelessly under the passenger's seat.

""...Excuse me.""

Kino reached to pick it up. It was the crown, worn by the king just a short while ago.

""Oh, that... It's a memento of my grandfather, so I brought it with me.""

Shizu whispered. Kino stroked Riku's fur one last time, then turned to Shizu,

""Well, I don't know whether or not I'm being out of line for saying this, but... Are you not going to become king?""

""I'm not.""

""Why not?""

""A man who intended to kill his own father has no right to be king.""

""You think so?""

Holding the crown in both hands, Kino silently- and gently- placed it on the young man's head.

""Doesn't fit me, does it?""

Kino gazed at him for a moment, then spoke up nonchalantly,

""Probably doesn't, yes.""

===

Kino mounted Hermes, started the engine, tucked in the coat's excess length, and put on goggles.

""Kino. If you don't mind, how about come with us to the town to the north? I know the way.""

Shizu called out from his buggy's driver seat. The crown was still on his head.

""No, I would rather not. There's another place I have to go to. Besides,""

""Besides?""

""I was told not to carelessly go along with men I don't know.""

As confusion showed on Shizu's face, Riku whispered something to him. For a moment, the young man seemed astonished, turning around to exchange a few words with the dog. He then looked back at Kino again, smiled, and lightly shook his head.

""Ah, yes, of course... I understand. This will be where we part ways, then. It would be nice if we were to meet again somewhere, Kino, Hermes.""

""Yes. Do take care. You too, Riku.""

""Thank you very much.""

Riku replied, and Hermes wasted not a second to poke fun at it.

""Later, pervy dog.""

""See ya, rustbucket.""

""Hmph.""

Shizu and Riku watched the motorrad run off until it was out of sight.

===

Shizu, down from his buggy again, stood at the edge of the lake. As he looked down, a reflection of the young man, wearing the same crown as that man, looked back at him.

Before he could decide whether or not it suited him, Riku began to lap the surface of the water at his feet. Tiny waves swayed and distorted Shizu's mirrored image.

Shizu turned around, looking past his buggy at the vast forest. He could not see beyond it-- He could no longer see the country in which he was born. He then looked at the driver's seat-- At his katana, which he had placed at its side.

Before he realized it, Riku was sitting at his side, regarding him with utmost respect.

""What do you think I should do, Riku?""

Shizu muttered, posing a question to his loyal companion.

""Try as I may, I could never lead your way, Master Shizu.""

Riku resolutely declared.

Shizu, putting on a calm face, muttered,

""Right...""

Then, for one last time, he looked back toward the country-- one shrouded away by the forest."
62,v9c2,9,2,"When I met the traveler who was called Kino, I was eleven years old and still living in the country where I was born. Truth be told, I can no longer remember what I was called back then.

I only vaguely remember that it was the name of some flower, and that if its pronunciation was changed slightly, it would become a mean insult. For that, I was often made fun of.

===

The traveler Kino, who came to my country on foot, was a person of tall stature and thin physique.

The young gate guard-soldier was troubled for a moment, contemplating whether or not to let the traveler in. He contacted his superiors, then, after a while, received a reply.

Before he was let into town, the soldier forced him to apply a powdery, white insect repellent to his head. 

All the while, from when he waited with the soldier to when he walked right up to me, I never took my eyes off him.

By then, the sun was already setting, and his long shadow reached all the way to my feet and extended past me.

He was wearing a type of boot that I had never seen before. His legs were thin, and so was his body.

He wore a black jacket and a long brown coat covered in dirt, so dusty that it seemed to be fresh off the ground. A single tattered bag, carried on his shoulder, was the entirety of his luggage.

He was so tall indeed. Although I was the tallest among my circle of friends back then, he still stooped slightly to speak to me.

""Hey there, little miss. Good day to you.""

His cheeks were sunken, his short hair disheveled. White powder still clung to the strands.

""My name is Kino. I travel from place to place. What's your name?""

Being short and easy to say, I thought 'Kino' was a nice name. Better than some odd flower's name, at the very least. Anyhow, I told him my name.

""It's a nice name. By the way, ××××× (my name). Is there a hotel in town? It'd be nice if it's a cheap place that has a shower. Please do tell me if you happen to know any. I'm already spent for the day.""

""There's my place.""

Kino smiled happily. At the time, my father and father ran a cheap hotel.

So I led Kino to my home.

When Father first saw Kino, he had a look of strong disapproval on his face. That look then quickly changed to a smile as he left the counter to lead the new guest to his room. Kino carried his large bag in his arms, thanked me, and made his way up the stairs.

I then went back to my own room. Stuck on the wall was a large piece of paper with [3 MORE DAYS] written on it in big red letters.

===

I recall waking up around noon the next day.

No one, not even my father and mother, had come to wake me up. It was my 'final week,' after all.

The paper in my room now read [2 MORE DAYS]. I washed my face at my room's washstand.

Hearing a noise from outside, I went out to the rear garden.

The vicinity was occupied by a heap of junk, full of useless, old, discarded machineries. I clearly remember playing around here; with the heap obscuring the evening sun, the area would quickly go dark.

In front of the scrap heap, Kino was crouching down, hammering on something. It was a wheel rim.

Not the thick kind which goes on cars, but a thin one which goes on motorrads (Note: Two-wheeled vehicles. Refers to only ones that cannot fly). One such motorrad was lying in front of Kino.

Noticing me, Kino said,

""Hey there. Good morning, ×××××.""

Kino's hair was all disheveled. I asked him,

""What are you doing?""

""I'm healing the motorrad. I'd asked for it to be sold to me, but they said it was an old piece of junk and that they don't need it anymore. I got it for free.""

""You mean repairing?""

""Healing.""

Kino smiled as he said so, then added that it might take some time because it was quite beat-up.

When he had finished hammering the wheel, he attached it to the motorrad.

For quite some time thereafter, Kino took other components and hammered them, pulled on them, tie them together, and even assembled complicated parts from the smaller pieces.

I watched him for a while.

Then I got hungry, and went back into the house and got something to eat by myself.

===

After the meal, I went out to watch Kino again.

The motorrad was about halfway 'healed' at this point. It was able to stand up properly now.

""It looks just like the motorrad I used to travel with a long time ago.""

He turned around for a second and told me so. He was polishing a rod-like object.

""How much longer will it take?""

I asked, albeit without much thought.

""Let's see... I say give it another day, and it'll be able to move around, all high-spirited.""

""The motorrad is going to move around?""

I asked Kino, noticing his odd choice of words.

""Well... technically, it won't be moving on its own. Someone has to ride it, and a pact must be made.""

""What pact?""

Kino looked at me, and patted the motorrad lightly, saying,

""In this case, it's a promise to help each other out.""

""Help each other how?""

""So you see, by myself, I can't run as fast as a motorrad.""

I nodded. He was so scrawny, after all.

""And while motorrads can go fast, they would fall over if no one is riding them to keep their balance.""

""Mm-hmm.""

""So if I ride on the motorrad, I would serve to keep its balance. I balance, the motrrad runs. With that deal, our journey will be more convenient and enjoyable.""

""I see... so that's what a pact to help each other is.""

""That's right. So when it wakes up, I'll have to make sure to ask, 'what do you say?'.""

""The motorrad is going to talk?""

""Of course it will.""

He said, winking once.

===

I went back to my room, poured a cup of tea, and presented it to Kino. He sipped it and said it was good. When he'd finished a little less than half of it, Kino asked,

""While we're at it, how about we decide on a name? Got any good ideas?""

""What was your old friend called, Kino?""

""Hermes.""

""That one's good.""

""Really? Let's go with that, then.""

As he said that, Kino smiled happily. Back then, at the moment I looked at that face of his, I recall myself smiling as well.

===

After that, Kino resumed 'healing' the motorrad. 

Then, after keeping watch for a while, I asked,

""What do you do, Kino?""

""What'd you mean, 'what do I do'?""

Kino replied while still facing away, keeping his hands busy.

""You're an adult, aren't you?""

""Well, more of one than you are, at any rate.""

""Adults are supposed to have some kind of job, aren't they?""

Kino looked confused, albeit just a little-- that was the impression I had. And I understand it now.

""Ah... Right, that's true.""

""Then what kind of work do you do?""

""Let's see... Stretching it a bit, I suppose I'd say that I 'travel'.""

Kino answered so.

""By travel, you mean going to all kinds of different places?""

""That's right.""

""Is there anything you hate about it?""

""Sometimes. But there are a lot more fun things, I'd say.""

""Then that's not a job.""

As I declared so, Kino stopped his hands and turned around.

""Jobs are hard. They're not fun. But we must do them to live on. If there's fun in it, then traveling is not a job.""

""I dunno...""

Kino murmured, tilting his head to one side.

""That's why tomorrow-- No, the day after! The day after tomorrow, I'll be getting an operation.""

""Operation for what?""

""For me to turn into an adult. That's why this is my 'final week'.""

I said, and Kino asked back, ""And what would that mean? If you don't mind, I'd like you to tell me what it is.""

At this point, I had become aware that Kino didn't know about the 'final week'. It was only natural, now that I think about it. Kino was not born in this country, after all.

Although it would take long, I decided that I would give an explanation. This was also because I believed Kino would listen.

""I'll explain everything, then.""

===

In my country-- the country I'd lived in back then, I mean-- those who were twelve years of age or above were considered adults. In turn, those who were younger than that were children. As for the definition of being an adult, it meant people who do work.

The adults would always say the following to children:

""You kids are free to do whatever you want. That's perfectly fine. But for us adults, doing as one pleases is not acceptable, no exceptions. It's because we have jobs. It is necessary to work in order to live on; it's the most important thing in one's lifetime. One must do their work without fail-- even if they don't want to, and even if they think it's not the right thing to do. This is serious business,""

Then they would go on to say,

""But rest assured. When you kids turn twelve, us adults will give you an operation. We'll open up your heads and take out the children inside all of you. Receive the operation, and you all will turn into adults overnight. Then you'll be able to do anything properly-- even the things you don't like to do. So there's no need to worry; every one of you can become splendid, hard-working adults. Then your mothers and fathers will be able to relax, too.""

For the children set to receive the operation, the one-week period before their twelfth birthday was called their 'final week'. The people of this country, whoever it be, are to not talk to the children going through such times. That was a set policy. It was so that the children could spend their final week as children in solitude, free from all manners of meddling.

As for the reasons for such a thing to be done, no one ever explained them to me.

===

With me wrapping up my shoddy explanation, Kino said,

""So that's what it is... What a cruel story.""

""Huh? Cruel, how? It's all thanks to the operation that any child can become a proper adult, isn't it?""

I asked. Back then, I was genuinely puzzled. I thought, if we didn't receive the operation to become proper adults, then what in the world will we end up becoming in the future?

""I don't know what a 'proper adult' is. Is one a proper adult for being able to do things they don't like? To keep on forever doing things they hate-- is that what makes life fun? And to be forcibly made to do so through operations... I don't really understand.""

With Kino saying all that, I felt an impulse to ask,

""Kino, you said earlier that you're more of an adult that I am, right? So are you saying that you're an adult?""

""Not really. If we're going by your definition of adults, then absolutely not.""

""So you're a child?""

""Not really. Going by your definition of children, then I guess I'm not.""

Neither an adult nor a child? Not at all getting the logic behind it, I asked,

""Then what in the world are you, Kino?""

With that asked, Kino gave the following answer:

""Me? I'm Kino. A guy named Kino. I guess that's it. Oh, and I travel.""

""Doing things you like to do?""

""That's right. I like to travel, so I travel. I won't be able to make a living by doing just that, of course, so I sell medicinal herbs and other unusual stuff I find on the way. I suppose that could be considered a job. But fundamentally, I travel-- Doing things I like and want to do.""

""Doing things you like...""

I was very jealous of Kino.

Until then, I had believed that children absolutely should have the operation and become proper, working adults. I thought choosing things to like or hate was an act reserved only for children.

For me, that time was soon coming to its end.

""What is it that you like the most?""

Kino asked, and I answered immediately,

""I like to sing!""

Hearing that, Kino smiled and went on,

""I like to sing, too. I often sing during my journey.""

Saying that, Kino then started singing.

I didn't catch the words due to the song's fast tempo, but I could tell that he was bad at it. When he finished singing, he said,

""I did bad, didn't I?""

""Yup. Very.""

I wholeheartedly agreed. Kino chuckled, then went on,

""Still, even though I don't seem to be improving, I have fun when I sing.""

I understood his sentiments well. I sometimes sang when I was by myself, with no one around to hear my singing except me.

So I started singing a song I liked. It was a song that started slow, then upped its tempo smoothly. I still sing this song often.

When I finished singing the whole thing, Kino abruptly applauded.

""You're good! I'm surprised. You're the best singer I've ever heard.""

Embarrassed, I thanked him.

""You like to sing, and you're this good at singing, so how about becoming a singer?""

Kino suggested, and I gave my answer,

""I can't become a singer.""

""Why not?""

""Because my mother and father aren't singers.""

""......""

""Adults give birth to children so that they would have someone to take over their jobs, right? Things have always been this way.""

In this country, it was the norm for children to succeed their parents' jobs when they became adults. An obligation, so to speak.

""I see... So that's the way of this country.""

Kino muttered so with regret in his voice, then turned back to concentrate on 'healing' the motorrad.

I went back to my room.

===

That night, I lay in my bed, thinking.

I had always believed that the best thing to do was to receive the operation and become an adult. But now, I suddenly felt that it was all so unnatural-- For one to not do the things they liked, all the while not being able to say that they hated the things they hated, and continuing to be that way for the rest of their lives. It was just as Kino said.

I thought about it.

Then, in one way or another, I reached a conclusion.

I didn't want to keep on being a child forever, but if I was going to become an adult, I wanted to become one by myself. Not to be forcibly turned into an adult in the same way as the others-- even if the order and timing were all messed up-- but to become one by myself. The kind of adult I find agreeable, with methods I find agreeable. And I wanted to choose a job that I was good at, or one that I liked, or even both at the same time.

===

The next morning...

When I woke, the note stuck in my room now read [LAST DAY].
I went down to the first floor and caught hold of my parents' attention. They were not allowed to initiate a conversation with me, but it was fine if I were the one who spoke first.

I rewound everything I'd thought about the night before,

""I don't want to have an operation to become an adult. Is there any other way to become one? A way to become an adult and keep being my current self?""

And ended up saying everything so inadvertently.

Those words were to radically change the course of my destiny... And Kino's as well.

As they heard that, my parents produced an expression as if they were experiencing a nightmare. My father suddenly started to yell,

""You fool! Do you even realize what you're saying!? You wicked child! Y-- You-- Are you making fools of those who had the operation to become splendid adults!? Taking us adults for complete fools!? Do you plan to stay a brat your whole life and never grow up!?""

As if the melody part was being passed on to another instrument, my mother followed up, her manner of speaking like a lashing whip, 

""Apologize to everyone, ×××××! Apologize, I say! Apologize! To your father! To everyone! Say sorry to all the adults in this country! Beg them to forgive your foolish whims! Tell them you're mistaken about what you just said! Tell them you'll never say such a thing ever again! Now!""

Thinking about it now, the two of them must have gone completely hysterical.

It was serious business for them, to the point that they did not write it off as a mere child spewing nonsense. The fact that, up until then, no one had been able to oppose going through the operation-- that they had been forced to receive it-- made them convince themselves that it was a wonderful thing. A defense mechanism to protect their peace of mind, I suppose.

Not that I was in a position to make such comments, having not received the operation and all. 

""Why would you suddenly say something like that? Who in the world taught you these inhuman ways of thinking!?""

My father continued to yell, as if he had gone mad.

Back then, I was so taken aback that I did not even have the intention to answer. But if he were to calmly think it over like an adult should, I'm sure he would figure that it was the traveler, Kino.

Hearing the commotion, nearby adults began to gather around.

""Is something wrong?""

""What's happening?""

""You all are being so loud...""

The adults spoke to my parents in a reproachful manner, telling them it was unacceptable for adults to behave the way they were doing. However, my father declared,

""Apologies! Truth is, my foolish daughter suddenly started saying the most frightful of things-- She wishes not to undergo her operation tomorrow...""

And in response, those adults...

""What? Inconceivable! It's all because you raised your child the wrong way! It's your fault!""

""You can say that again! Wishing to become an adult without an operation... That's heresy!""

""What do you take the magnificent operation for!? You might be a kid, but some things are unforgivable!""

They began to shout, as if something inside them had been broken.

""W-- we do beg your pardon. All this is the doing of our unworthiness...""

Saying that, my parents apologized profusely under the surrounding pressure, then turned to glare at me,

""You have brought shame upon us, saying those stupid things! ...Ah! It's that filthy traveler! He's the one who put these foolish ideas in your head!""

Finally realizing it, my father pulled me along as he went all over the place in search of Kino.

Kino was outside the entrance. Standing beside him was the motorrad, shining like new as if it had just been bought. The same motorrad that had been junk the day before last. Kino's oversized baggage was strapped tight to the back seat, shaking in perfect sync with the engine's vibrations. The back wheel didn't touch the ground, instead spinning while suspended in the air. Draped across the seat was the brown coat Kino had been wearing when he came into town. It was slightly cleaner now.

My father screamed at him,

""Hey, you there! Damn filthy traveling bastard!""

As if he already saw it coming, Kino ignored the name-calling. With that, my father sprang up in a fit of rage, screaming in unintelligible words. He sounded more like a barking dog.

Kino looked my way and said quietly,

""This is what the operation gets you? Perhaps you're better off without it, after all.""

He winked. I unintentionally spurted out a giggle. In an instant, the inside of my head felt clear and serene.

""You! YOU!""

My father pointed at Kino, spittle and froth flying from his mouth as he shouted. Finally, Kino looked at my father and asked, ""What is it?""

""Don't 'what is it' me! On your knees, now! And apologize... to me, to my wife, and to all of the people of this country... Apologize, I say!""

""Apologize? What for?""

Kino asked back in an expression of calmness. In answer, my father howled in unintelligible words once again. His face was red, and his whole body shook. I looked at him-- at a person who identified as a 'proper adult'.

Truth be told, I saw no difference in that look of his from mine when I'd cried and screamed after having a fight over mundane things with my friends.

As my father poised for more yelling, or perhaps more howling,

""Now, I must ask you to leave it at that.""

Someone called out to my father. That person was a high-ranking official in the country.

Back then, I didn't know what the official title was, being so hard to remember and all. But the person was an official, that's for sure. Appearing as one among the crowd of adults who had gathered around the commotion without me noticing, the official initiated a conversation with Kino,

""Dear traveler, every country, every household-- they all have their own distinctive customs. You understand, do you not?""

Kino answered,

""Yes, I understand.""

""This country, too, has its customs. They are not to be meddled with by your activities. Am I wrong?""

The official asked, and Kino shrugged, saying,

""Well, that's true.""

He then took a quick look around at his surroundings.

""I was just thinking about making my departure soon. I have a feeling that I'm going to be killed if I stay any longer.""

He said, seemingly cracking a joke.

""Are there any procedures I must go through before leaving?""

The official told him there were no such things, then continued,

""If you head straight that way, you will reach the gate; it is open. You will be able to leave through there. At any rate, being killed is an unthinkable scenario, since you have entered this country through official procedures. Until you are through the gate, your safety is guaranteed. This is the Country of Adults, after all.""

The official said, pointing at one of the streets which extended past the motorrad.

Kino turned toward me, crouched down, and said as he looked into my face,

""This is goodbye, then, ×××××.""

""You're leaving already?""

I asked him, why not stay for two or three more days? In the case that I ended up receiving the operation, I wanted to know what attitude would I be having toward Kino when I talked to him afterwards. I wanted to try talking to Kino after becoming an adult.

However, Kino said,

""It's my policy to stay only three days in any one country. I can learn almost everything about most countries in that length of time, and if I take longer than that, I won't be able to visit as many new countries... Goodbye. Be well.""

I lightly waved at him, and Kino started climbing aboard the motorrad. But then my father approached me, carrying a long, thin kitchen knife. My mother was right next to him. Kino turned around.

My father looked at the official. The official nodded.

I was clueless as to why my father would bring a kitchen knife outside, when standing right before me, no less. I found the sight to be quite comical.

Kino asked the official,

""Why is that man carrying a kitchen knife?""

The official, in a tone completely unchanged from before, spoke the most ridiculous of things,

""Let me explain to you, then, as a special case. It is for the disposal of his daughter.""

Color drained from Kino's face. I did not immediately understand what was happening, however. I only heard Kino's voice of surprise,

""What?""

""Like I said, disposal. The girl has denied the magnificent operation and disobeyed her parents-- disobeyed those above her. We can not afford to leave such a child to her own devices. Children are, at all times and in all cases, the possessions of their parents. Parents created their children, and it is within their natural rights to dispose of their failed creations.""

With the official saying that, I finally realized that I was going to be killed. But even though it was true that I knew it, and that I did not want to die, there was nothing I could do about it. I looked up and saw my father looking back down at me in disdain,

""A failed creation...""

He grumbled.

""Dear traveler. It is dangerous here. Please step aside.""

The official said, and at the same time, my father brandished his knife and made a lunge at me. The blade could be seen shining in silver. Ah, how beautiful, I thought.

Kino rushed in from the side, attempting to restrain my father. 

At that moment, as my world went silent and time slowed down to a crawl, I looked on, realizing that the knife would stab me before Kino would reach my father.

Thank you. But you won't make it in time.

Time crawled on in the silent world. The knife was about to pierce right through me when my father twisted it to his left side. The blade turned from its vertical position to horizontal. As Kino dove in, it caught him in the chest, and pierced right through.

""GAH--!""

Sound returned, and I heard Kino's strange cry. Kino was leaning against my father, as if clinging on to him. The tip of the kitchen knife could be seen protruding from Kino's back.

Kino fell over face-up, knife and all, with a dull thud. He laid still. I knew he was already dead.

Unable to think, I took a few steps away, my back colliding with the motorrad. 

Silence persisted for a short while. Then, my father...

""Heh heh...""

He was laughing. Then he went on to say,

""Uh-oh? This person jumped in between us, and the knife meant for killing the kid stabbed him instead. What judgement should we have on this incident?""

I knew full well that my father was giving a half-baked excuse. The other adults there must have known, too.

The official started speaking,

""Mm-hmm. The traveler did jump in so suddenly, so I suppose there is nothing that can be done. It was not as if you were intending to kill him-- This is an accident. A very unfortunate accident. You are not guilty. Is that not right, everyone?""

The adults around them agreed unanimously and chimed in, ""That's right."" ""No mistaking it."" ""How unfortunate of him.""

""Buh--! But of course!""

My father said, happy and relieved.

Although I knew I was soon to be killed, for me to die without receiving the operation to become a 'proper adult,' I was glad.

Right before my eyes, I witnessed my father attempting to pull the knife out of Kino-- out of Kino's corpse. But it would not come out, so my mother gave him a hand. The hilt was covered in blood, so they wrapped it with a piece of cloth and pulled, little by little, SHNK! SHNK! SHNK!

Thinking about it now, I feel as if that time frame was Kino's final gift to me.

As my parents worked together on the pulling, a little voice from behind entered my ears. It sounded like the voice of a younger boy.

""Have you ever ridden a bicycle?""

I whispered back,

""I have.""

Then I heard the following:

""You'll die if you stay here, right?""

I answered,

""Yeah. But I'd rather die than stay alive and go through the operation. It's all the same anyway.""

SHNK! SHNK! SHNK! SHNK! SHNK!

By this point, about half of the kitchen knife was out.

""Hm~m... So you want to die?""

To the question, I have an honest answer,

""I'd like to not die, if I had a choice.""

""Then,""

The little voice said,

""Take the third choice.""

""What's that?""

SHNK! SHNK!

Almost all of the knife was out. But I felt perfectly calm, listening on the complicated things the little voice suddenly started saying,

""First, jump on the motorrad behind you. Grab the handle with both hands and hold tight. Twist your right hand toward yourself and lean your body forward. Think of it as a fast, heavy bicycle.""

SCHWNK!

The knife slid out of Kino's corpse, and my father and mother fell over backward. Ohh, the adults around them cried out in alarm, then proceeded to laugh without restraint. Blood gushed up like a fountain for a brief moment, then subsided.

""If I do that, then what?""

To the little voice, I asked loudly. The surrounding adults looked at me with a dubious expression on their faces. My father held the bloodstained kitchen knife tightly in his bloodstained hands, looking at me with a smile on his face. I saw the condition my father was in at the time as absolutely repulsive, but I felt no fear. I am not like him.

""Run away!""

I heard the voice, now loud and clear. Spinning around and leaping onto the motorrad's seat, I caught a mere glimpse of my father rushing toward me.

As I had been told earlier, I twisted the right handgrip and leaned forward.

THUMP, the motorrad landed on the ground in front of it. At the same time, the engine roared to life, VROOM! My body was thrown backward. So as to not fall, I clung on tight to the handles.

The crowd of adults dispersed, each one of them stepping back.

It was then when I realized that I was riding a motorrad by myself. I steadied the handles lightly, just like when I rode my bicycle down a bumpy road. Although this road was a flat one, the speed kept increasing, more and more. It felt strange, but I got used to it soon enough.

""You're doing good! Keep it up!""

I could still hear the voice.

""Hold the tank firmly with your thighs. That'll keep you steady. From now, shift the gears just as I tell you.""

I did as I was instructed. Suddenly, the wind blowing at my face became more intense, sending tears streaming from my eyes. The gate came into view before me, becoming bigger and bigger. When I heard a strong woosh, the gate passed over my head.

Outside the gate, on the grass-covered plain, a single tawny path extended onward. From the day I was born, this was the first time I had ever been out of the country.

The wind stung my eyes, but I soon came to pay it no mind.

Breaking into an exhausted sob, I rode on.

===

I don't even know how much time had passed.

""Hey, don't you think we've gone far enough?""

I came back to myself following the sudden initiation of a conversation.

""Do what I tell you from now.""

As I was being instructed, I frantically fumbled around, doing things like pulling on a lever with my left hand and moving my right foot at something, and the motorrad gradually slowed down. When the timing seemed good for stopping, I stuck out my feet.

On a bicycle, my toes would have lightly touched the ground and all would be well, but this time, my soles felt an overwhelming weight; I momentarily paused in confusion, my body heeling over to my left.

""Uwah--!""

I heard the voice. My left hand was dragged down as it still gripped the handle, and I fell to the ground. At the same time, a 'GACHUNK!' could be heard.

""Oh, the cruelty. Who on earth was the one who committed such a cruel act?""

To voice asked in jest, directing the question at me, laying on my back and looking up at the sky. The empty, blue sky.

Then, I rose up. Taking a look around at my surroundings, I saw that I was standing in the center of a field, where red flowers bloomed in profusion.

The field was a wide one; when I looked back along the rut that the motorrad's wheels made over the flowers, I could no longer see the country in which I was born.

""Kino...""

I muttered. The images of Kino's final moments, lying face-up with the kitchen knife through his chest, flashed in my eyes, then faded away.

Oddly, I was not sad at all.

I shed no tears. Perhaps they had already been used up for the time being.

I was not in pain, nor was I feeling happy. I simply stood there in a daze.

""S'cuse me!""

I could hear a voice from near my feet. I looked down, and saw the motorrad lying on its side.

""You're a cruel one, you know that?""

""Come again?""

""I'd like to be stood up right about now, if you please.""

It was then when it first crossed my mind that the owner of the voice had been the motorrad all along.

""Ah, so it was you.""

I said, and the motorrad sounded a little angry,

""Ah-huh, isn't it obvious? There's nobody else here, is there?""

""Right. Sorry.""

""No need to say sorry; I just wanna stand up.""

The motorrad acted up like a spoiled child all of a sudden; I found it strangely amusing.

I did as the motorrad asked, crouching down and pressing my chest against the seat, then pulling it up with all my strength.

Red flower petals scattered.

Then I put my foot on the protrusion near the rear wheel and applied pressure on it, pushing it down as the motorrad stood up. The motorrad moved backward over the stand and didn't topple over again when I let go.

""Thanks.""

The motorrad expressed its gratitude in good manners.

""You're welcome.""

I answered in kind.

""Things got real dangerous back there, didn't it?""

The motorrad said, but for a second, I had no idea what it meant. Then I remembered the knife, shining bright. It was as if I had recalled a lost memory from years long past.

""It sure did... Thank you for saving me.""

I said, and the motorrad replied,

""Same goes the other way. If I'd been left there, who knows what would have happened to me? You really saved me by riding me out here, Kino.""

Hearing that, I thought for a moment about the 'pact to help each other out'. Then, curious as to why I was being called what the motorrad just called me, I asked,

""What did you just call me?""

""Hm? I called you Kino.""

""Why?""

""When I asked you your name a moment ago, you said Kino, didn't you?""

""I'm--""

I intended to say my name, but I felt as if that name was no longer one of my own. That name of mine, a child who lived in that country without a care in the world. A child who believed one had to have an operation when they turned twelve in order to become a 'proper adult'.

That person no longer existed in this world.

So I said, as I trampled on the red flowers, taking a step closer to the motorrad,

""I'm... Kino. My name is Kino. It's a nice name, isn't it?""

""Yeah, I like it. Say, what about my name? Got anything?""

The motorrad asked, and I thought back to the name both of us had decided on.

""Hermes. Your name is Hermes. The name of old Kino's friend.""

""Hm~m, Hermes... Not bad, I guess.""

Hermes said, then proceeded to repeat that name again and again, ""Hermes... Hermes, huh..."" Liking it, I'm sure. Hermes then asked me,

""So, what're we gonna do now?""

We stood there, in the center of a sea of red.

All the while, I had no answers.

===

Afterwards, we decided to first head for a nearby country, but we ended up getting lost in a forest. There, we met a certain elderly person by chance, and were taught various things. If I hadn't met that person, I wouldn't have ended up becoming who I am now, I'm sure. I hold sincere gratitude for that person, so much that they could not be expressed in words.


But that is another story for another time."
63,v9c3,9,3,"A lone motorrad (Note: Two-wheeled vehicles. Refers to only ones that cannot fly) ran down the single road through the wasteland.

Two mountains could be seen to their right, and one far away to their left. All were bare of trees. The road was of the same brown as the surrounding land, and were it not for the occasional large cans that dotted the shoulder of the road, it would have been impossible to distinguish the path from the wilderness.

The motorrad sped its way through such a road, however uneven it may be. Long, thick clouds of dirt were raised in its wake. At this point, the rider would likely not be able to see anything behind them.

Travel luggage had been fully loaded onto the motorrad's rear carrier. The bag and the sleeping bag were fastened together with bands and nets, and there was one silver cup, hanging from the net and swaying around.

The rider was wearing a coat of the same color as the earth, its excess length tied around both thighs. Worn on the rider's head was a hat which resembled that of an aviator's. It was attached with a small visor on its front, and on its sides were earflaps, the ends of which were tied together at its wearer's chin. Worn on the eyes was a pair of chipped, silver-framed goggles, and wrapped around the face was a bandana for protection against dirt. Although one would not be able to see the rider's facial appearance at this time, the person was quite visibly skinny.

Noticing something, the rider throttled down the motorrad's speed. When the cloud of dirt that danced behind and around them had lessened considerably, the rider stopped the motorrad, then took a good look at the things which blanketed both sides of the road.

""What's up with... those?""

The motorrad asked.

""They're human corpses, no matter how you look at them.""

The rider answered.

Those things were brown and piled up all over the place; one would have mistaken them as dried wood at a glance. However, the outlines of limbs and heads could also be seen attached. Many of them were in pieces, some only having their lower half left, and there were also detached arms scattered about. All of them had been dried up in the arid climate, filling the wasteland as nature-made mummies. Varying in size, there were so many of them piled together that one would not see the ground.

""I know that much, Kino. I was asking why there are so many mummies lying around here. It's strange.""

""I don't know, Hermes. Perhaps this place is a graveyard...""

The motorrad's rider, referred to as Kino, answered bluntly.

In turn, the motorrad, referred to as Hermes, followed up, ""Ohh... I get it,"" and proceeded to assume a know-it-all persona,

""If it's a graveyard, wouldn't they be buried instead? This is a food reserve, for sure.""

""Food reserve?""

""That's right. The meat can be kept around longer when dried. When they get hungry, they come here and bring the meat back to eat. And by they, I mean the people of the country up we're heading toward, of course. These things are like the junkies in your bag, Kino.""

""...Jerkies?""

""Yeah, that.""

Hermes said, falling silent momentarily, then perking up again,

""Thus poor Kino was caught and eaten in the country of cannibals! Young, fresh meat is always better, after all. Well, you're probably a bit sinewy, but you'll be edible if they boil you enough.""

"".......""

""Thus our journey came to its end! Ahh, I wanted to run some more!""

After while after Hermes was done talking, Kino spoke up,

""Hermes, you're super bored, aren't you?""

""...Yup.""

""Hang in there for a little longer. We'll be arriving at the next country soon.""

Kino said, then took off on Hermes. The flanking piles of corpses continued on for a while.

===

""What kind of 'soon' was that? It's already noon...""

When Hermes started complaining so, the country's wall finally came into view. They ran on further, soon arriving in front of the gate, on which [WELCOME TO VELDELVAL] had been written.

===

""We welcome you to Veldelval. It has been a long time since we last had a visitor.""

The gatekeeping soldier said, saluting with a smile.

""I'm Kino. This here is my partner, Hermes. We'd like to request entry for sightseeing and recreation.""

Kino said, holding out a pass card. The soldier accepted it with both hands and put it into the inspection machine. The card re-emerged quickly, and the soldier handed it back to Kino with both hands.

""No problem at all. For how many days would you like to stay?""

When Kino answered that they would be staying three days, leaving the day after the next, the soldier said it was fine if they stayed longer, before writing something down on the official documents. The soldier then asked,

""Are you carrying any persuaders (Note: Firearms) with you?""

""Yes.""

The coat Kino had on had been taken off and draped over Hermes. Worn underneath the coat was a black jacket, collar upturned. Around Kino's waist was a thick belt, with several small pouches on it.

From the right thigh holster, Kino took out the hand persuader and placed it on the countertop. Then, with left hand reaching for the backside of the waist, another one was presented. The soldier's eyes widened.

""Now this is a surprise, Kino. For you to possess such amazing pieces of craft...""

The soldier looked at the weapons in admiration.

The one which had been presented first was a single action revolver, the type of which bullets and liquid propellant were loaded in separately; looking closely, it was currently ready for firing. Kino called it Canon. The other one was a semi-automatic persuader of thin silhouette which utilized .22LR rimfire cartridges. It was apparent that both of them had been used extensively. However, they were not dirty and had been oiled properly.

The soldier asked on the spur of the moment,

""Are you ranked, by any chance, Kino?""

""Black Belt, Fourth Dan.""

The one who promptly answered was not Kino, but Hermes.

"" Wow... you have my respect. Since you're ranked, feel free to take these in with you. I'm sure you won't be needing them, though, since this country is safe. All that aside, we welcome you both with all our hearts, Kino and Hermes. We hope for your stay to be a pleasant one. Here is a map of the country. May it be of use.""

""Thank you very much,"" Kino said, holstering the persuaders and accepting the map. The soldier saluted, and Kino pushed Hermes along as the gate rattled open.

===

Surrounded by a crowd immediately upon emerging into the country, Kino promptly shrunk back for a brief moment. Men and women, young and old, looked at Kino and Hermes, shouting with smiles on their faces, ""Thank you for coming!"" ""Happy to have you here!"" There were those who played instruments, and also those who started dancing.

Hermes vacantly whispered, so as to let only Kino hear,

""Ahh, we're really gonna get eaten after all. Everyone looks so hungry...""

===

Afterwards, Kino asked the welcoming residents whether or not there was a hotel that is not too expensive, with space for Hermes and a shower. One among them suggested a hotel to the south, which had a shower, but another argued that it was too expensive, prompting others to chime in their suggestions. The exchange went on for a while.

The hotel recommended by the person who seemed to have won the debate, which fulfilled all of Kino's criteria, stood next to a considerably old building with a sign proclaiming it to be the History Museum. Kino was initially refused at the hotel's doorsteps, with an employee telling the traveler to first dust off the coat and baggage, and also wash Hermes clean with the water hose at the entrance. Hermes suggested, ""This is a good time to change my spark plug, don't you think, dear friend Kino?"" but was ignored.

Kino then proceeded to the room, taking a shower and getting a change of clothes and underwear. The hotel's restaurant served a kind of fish that Kino had never seen before, but it turned out to be very delicious.

===

""So you're the traveler who just arrived today? Have you been to the History Museum yet?""

""You should check out the History Museum. Spend half a day there, and you'll know all there is to know about this country.""

""The curator there is a very kind person. She'll teach you many things about our history, I'm sure.""

Kino, in a jacket, simply wandered around town, pushing the baggage-free Hermes along. Everyone and anyone they came across recommended that they took a trip to the History Museum. And whenever they asked for interesting places in town, the answer they get would always be ""The History Museum"".

In the end they decided, albeit reluctantly, that they would pay it a visit.

When they passed the front of the hotel, an employee called out to them, saying ""The History Museum is a very informative place. Why not pay it a visit?"". And when Kino replied, ""We're actually on our way there,"" the employee immediately rushed back to the front desk and brought them discount tickets.

===

The History Museum building was of traditional folk construction, composed of overlapping arches. Its entranceway was terribly dark, but looking through it revealed a bright and spacious interior.

Kino bought the tickets then went in, and once inside, one woman came out to welcome them. She may be elderly and white-haired, but her figure was slim and her back was straight. She seemed to be quite the kind, wise person. The woman spoke, her voice well-projected,

""Welcome, dear visitors, to our History Museum. I am the curator.""

""Good day to you, curator. I'm Kino. This here is my partner, Hermes.""

Kino gave an introduction of themselves, and Hermes politely greeted the curator as well.

===

For a while thereafter, Kino and Hermes toured the museum under the curator's guidance. There were no other visitors.

So as to enable convenient viewing for wheelchair-bound visitors, the interior had been outfitted with ramps, and the height of the exhibits were carefully planned out. Kino was able to push Hermes around everywhere throughout the tour.

Each and every one of the exhibits were well-crafted. They included painstakingly detailed models depicting the country through the ages, from the time when the first people settled down in the wasteland to the process of the town's expansion and advancement, numerous tools essential for their daily lives throughout those times, and even a legitimate copy of the first newspaper issue they ever published.

The explanations were easy to understand, comprising of a good balance of text, musical cues, and visuals. Furthermore, for any word Kino and Hermes couldn't read, the curator would provide them with thorough explanations. Kino enthusiastically observed everything.

===

Eventually, they were nearing the [Modem History] section.

There, the tone of the displays changed, so abruptly and drastically. Where the focus of the earlier displays had been on uplifting subjects such as the people's ways of lives and cultural heritage, the exhibits from this point on featured weapons and protective gear, depictions of battlefields, and everything connected with war.

To start with, the explanatory note at the entrance of the section read: [WAR WITH THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRY BEGINS - THE HISTORY OF SLAUGHTER].

""From this point on is our history of war.""

The curator said, expression unchanged.

===

For many years, this country had been sporadically at war with the neighboring country.

The two countries were completely different, be it in religion, way of life, race, language-- everything. It was all too easy for them to view each other with mutual hostility, and once a war had broken out, the hostility escalated further.

Both countries had always intended to destroy the other. For that purpose, they waged one war after another.

However, neither side was able to annihilate the other.

Battles raged on in the vast wilderness, but the victors never had enough resources remaining to invade the enemy nation thereafter.

A state of suspended hostile activities would be in effect for a time, then, as if they had remembered their conflicts, the armies' marches would commence once again.

They would continue to do battle, exhausting their respective nations' assets and ending the war with the final victor undecided.

This country and the neighboring country had been in such a relationship, the beginning of which was a hundred and ninety-two years ago.

===

""I see. Are the mummies in the wasteland casualties of war, by any chance?""

Hermes asked, and the curator answered,

""No, they are not. We cremate the remains of our dead. Our neighbor does as well.""

Before Hermes could ask what they were, Kino asked while looking at some other materials,

""Curator. From reading this text, I take it that this section of the exhibit ends at around fifteen years ago? And at the present, this country does look quite affluent and stable. In fact, it has been a while since we've visited a place so peaceful.""

""Yes, it is as you said. At the present, this country is a very stable one indeed. I suppose you could tell that much just from observing the people... As expected of a traveler.""

The curator said, without irony in her words.

""Does that mean there is no longer any conflict with the neighboring country?""

""Yes, there is none. Although we do not interact much, there is no killing between us.""

Kino turned away from the materials and back to the curator, then asked,

""Might I ask... What happened fifteen years ago, when the wars suddenly ended?""

The curator's gray eyes fixed on Kino. In turn, Kino's eyes fixed on the curator.

A moment of silence passed, and the curator spoke up with a smile,

""That will be explained in the next section, Kino. There is not much time left before the museum closes, however. When is your departure, Kino and Hermes?""

""We'll be leaving the day after tomorrow. Any time will do, as long as it is within the day.""

With Kino saying so, the curator proposed,

""In that case, we can show you the answer to your question tomorrow, Kino. Will you be able to spare the whole day?""

""I certainly can. What about you, Hermes?""

""I'm fine with it and all, but what are we going to look at?""

Hermes asked, and the curator answered,

""War. With the neighboring country.""

""War? I don't wanna be in combat...""

Hermes spoke frankly, stating strong opposition to the proposal.

""You need not be worried. In practice, it is not a conflict in which blood will be shed among us. It is only a war in name, and not a combat situation where we fight to the death. If you were to observe it, you are sure to understand how we made peace and how we have been maintaining it.""

===

The next morning, Kino woke at the break of dawn, beginning the day with persuader practice and maintenance. Then, while eating breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, Kino noticed that the streets seemed especially boisterous​ since early morning.

Hermes, too, looked on with curiosity at the fleet of hovees (Note: Short for Hover Vehicle. Refers in this case to levitating cars) that have been passing by the front of the hotel.

Before long, Kino and Hermes were picked up by a young soldier who said that he had been told the whole story from the curator, and that he would serve as their guide for the day. They made their way to the plaza in the center of town.

At the plaza, three dozen gray hovees were lined up. Half of them were equipped with fully-automatic persuaders on both sides of their open decks, with ammunition belts fed into them. 

Kino and Hermes were invited on board one of the hovees labeled [SPECTATORS]. Seeing that there were difficulties in pushing Hermes up, the soldiers improvised by making a ramp up to the hovee's deck using metal plates, enabling Kino to ride the motorrad up. All the while, they were applauded on by the onlookers.

The fleet of hovees then departed, sent off with great fanfare.

===

On the way, the fleet stopped for an early lunch break, then departed once again, gliding across the brown wasteland and crossing over four mountains before coming to a stop.

After a short wait, another fleet of similar hovees appeared. And similarly, they were equipped with persuaders on their decks.

The other party proceeded to line up their hovees in a beautiful and systematic formation.

Their military uniform was completely different from that of the country Kino came with, whether it be the design, color scheme, and even how each of the pieces were matched together. All of them were not wearing pants, but skirts.

""They are the Relsumia National Defense Force.""

The young soldier, responsible for guiding Kino and Hermes, filled them in on the matters.

""This Relsumia-- Is it the neighboring country you were at war with since a little less than two hundred years ago?""

Hermes asked, and the soldier answered,

""That's right. From now, too, we will be going to war with them.""

The soldier then added,

""But don't worry. We are perfectly safe; in fact, not one soldier on either side will die. This is not the old-fashioned type of war, after all.""

===

Before long, the sun rose up to its zenith.

Thereupon, hovees of both fleets-- only the ones equipped with persuaders-- moved out into a new formation, forming a beautiful and systematic double file. In their vanguard was a single hovee, one with especially elegant trappings.

On it stood a man who seemed to be a priest; he started delivering a speech.

""The One Hundred and Eighty-Fifth Relsumia-Veldelval War shall commence henceforth! The rules are the same as always!""

His vessel moved out, and the two rows of hovees followed while staying in formation.

""We're going, too. Please hang on tight.""

The soldier told Kino and Hermes as the remaining hovees ascended, following the formation from above.

Before long, the high-altitude hovees caught up to the fleet. Continuing on their way for a while longer, they passed over a gentle slope and stopped, hovering still in the air.

""There it is-- Can you see that?""

In the direction the soldier was pointing stood a large human settlement.

Erected beside the oasis over the hill, the settlement comprised of many simple houses made of mud. They were scattered about with no defined pattern, nor were there roads connecting them.

A number of people could be seen moving about. They wore simple clothes and employed simple tools. They seemed not to notice the hovees in the air.

""That is a local tribe, the Tatata. Anyways, please take a look at the ground to the north.""

Kino and Hermes looked in the direction they were told, observing the vanguard hovee descending, flying ahead with great speed just barely above the surface.

The vehicle streaked its way through the settlement from the north side to the south, all the while dumping down a large quantity of red dust. It effectively drew a distinct, red line across the north-south diameter of the settlement. A number of the Tatata tribespeople could be seen rushing out of their houses, seeming surprised and frightened.

""Now the 'war' begins. The east side is our 'battlefield,' and the west is Relsumia's.""

As the soldier explained so, the fleet of hovees broke their formation and sped toward the settlement. From a straight line, they fanned out gracefully. The soldiers then proceeded to open fire.

A shrill rattle echoed as the closest and most vulnerable of the Tatata tribespeople were being shot down. The hovees moderated their altitude so as to not crash into any of the houses, shooting the Tatata people on sight.

A young man ran for the safety of his house, but was spotted and shot before he could go inside. He went down in a blossom of deep crimson. The barrage continued in the direction of his house, easily leveling the building.

As the hovee turned around, several women and children rushed off a different house; they too were shot down. One woman attempted to shield a child; her body twirled as she fell, and the small child's head was blown off.

A man particularly fast with his legs ran past the side of another hovee. However, the hovee made a sharp turn and fired intercepting shots. The man collapsed in his path. His body twitched as bullets continued to hail down where he fell, gushing with blood like a bursting balloon before finally ceasing all movement.

""Alright! He's doing great!""

To Kino and Hermes' side, the soldier pumped his fist and shouted. An embarrassed grin then appeared on his face,

""Ah, excuse me-- The one who just scored that shot there is my big brother. He's always been good at 'war'.""

He said, then continued, as if he had just recalled the obligation to ask,

""Should we go down a little lower? You'll be able to get a better look.""

Kino replied,

""No, thank you. Up here is fine.""

With the offer declined, the soldier agreed, remarking that stray bullets are scary indeed. He then returned his sights to the battlefields down below.

The sound of persuader shots continued to resound.

Now, the hovees fired at the Tatata tribespeople who had escaped into the woods near the oasis. The woods, too, had been divided by the red line, and both forces skillfully kept their shots in each of their designated areas; east hovees shot only at the east side, the west ones only at the west. Before long, all of the trees were leveled, with bits of red visible between them.

A number of people jumped into the pond of the oasis; they too were shot, the water dancing mad with the bullets. Before long, while the pond was being dyed a whole new color, clumps of indistinguishable matter rose up to the surface.

Kino then turned to another location, noticing that a Tatata youth had thrown an axe at one of the hovees. It struck a soldier onboard in the leg. In turn, the soldier pinned his leg down and returned fire, shredding the youth in half and obliterating his upper body into a red mist. The soldier then rolled off his seat, however, and another soldier took over, gripping the persuader tight.

Those who attempted to flee the settlement were picked off by the hovees that were patrolling the borders, but it was not possible to shoot down all of them due to their sheer numbers. Those who were able to maneuver their way through the rain of bullets ran for their lives, bolting away from the settlement and fading into the distance. The hovees did not pursue them, instead focusing on shooting down those who were still inside the perimeter.

One of the hovees slowly scanned the settlement, shooting down at those who were collapsed on the ground that seemed to not be bloodied enough. Bodies flew and scattered as bullets rained down on them. Those who were playing dead were effectively snuffed out.

Eventually, the settlement was devoid of human movement. The sound of persuader shots, too, were mostly silenced by this point. Those who had bolted out of the settlement could no longer be seen.

Coincidentally, the sun had waned down a one-fist length from its zenith.

The same vanguard vessel as before streaked its way through the settlement once more, all the while blowing a whistle. The hovees ceased their fire, gathered at the edge of the settlement, and formed the same line as when they arrived.

""Time's up. The 'war' has ended.""

The soldier said as all of the airborne hovees descended to the settlement grounds.

""They are the 'counters'. They'll be collecting the bodies onto their hovees, then the sensors aboard their craft will weigh the kill. The side with higher measured weight is deemed the victor of this war. It is customary that we wait at the meeting point we came from, so we'll be taking off right away. Is that fine for you?""

Kino nodded. The smell of blood drifted up high in the sky, then faded away as soon as the hovees moved out.

===

The hovees returned to the meeting point, and the fleet awaited the counters.

The soldiers were in good cheer, apparent from their bright expressions. Until then, they had not exchanged a word with their rivaling country, but now they were laughing, those on the hovees from one row chatting with those on the other. The commanding officers, too, shared a table and held a friendly conversation.

The soldier who had been hit in the leg with an axe reappeared all bandaged up, showered with applause and cheers from all soldiers present. He laughed, embarrassed, and was given a badge of some kind by the commanding officer. The soldiers cheered him on even more.

At last, the counters returned. Each of their hovees bore a mountain of corpses, blood streaming down from their decks.

===

The same man who had announced commencement of the war stood on the deck of his hovee and declared,

""Measurement results: Ten-to-Nine! Victor of the Hundred and Eighty-Fifth War: Veldelval!""

Right that moment, the Veldelval soldiers exploded in cheer. The Relsumia soldiers, on the other hand, held their heads up in disappointment. They soon recovered, however, and gave their rivaling nation a salute.

The Veldelval soldiers returned their salute in kind.

Then, while they were waving their hats at each other, each of their hovees started on their way home.

On board the same hovee as Kino and Hermes, the soldier exclaimed, with no intention to hide his excitement,

""We did it! We won! Kino, Hermes, this is going to be the talk of the town when we get back! Ahh, I'm so happy-- Oh, which reminds me... If you plan to buy anything for your travels, you really should buy them today. Everyone will be celebrating so hard that they'll give you super special bargains, I'm sure!""

""Hey, can I ask you one thing?""

Hermes called out to the soldier.

""Go ahead, ask away!""

""What are the counter going to do with the bodies? You're not going to bring them home as well, are you?""

""Of course we're not bringing them back. We have a dumping ground to the east of the country. We'll be dropping them off there.""

""That so? I thought that might be the case, too... So the mummy mystery is good as solved now eh, Kino?""

===

The next morning Kino woke, as always, at the break of dawn.

The town was silent.

Last evening, the country erupted in celebration of the news of their victory; it was in an uproar wherever one went. The town flooded with alcohol, cheers, and music.

And just as the soldier said, when Kino went to buy portable rations, the drunken old shopkeeper had offered them for next to nothing. Kino stocked up without restraint, to the point that Hermes warned, ""I can't carry any more than that."" They then returned to the hotel ahead of time. There was nobody else there.

Kino started the day off with a shower, then persuader maintenance and practice. Then, after double-checking the baggage, Kino ate the older portable rations for breakfast.

When the sun had risen well over the horizon, Kino knocked on Hermes up. Hermes was still half-asleep, but when Kino remarked, ""We've got to go to the History Museum, remember?"" the motorrad was instantly wide awake.

Kino proceeded to push Hermes along, putting into consideration that starting the motorrad's engine could disturb the townspeople who were still sleeping.

At the entrance of the History Museum was the young soldier, asleep with a wine bottle hugged in his arms, seeming to have celebrated all night. Two sheets of blankets had been put over him.

Kino and Hermes quietly entered the museum, and were welcomed by the curator.

""Good morning, Kino and Hermes. Thank you for visiting us again.""

""Good morning, curator. We've come to see the section we hadn't seen the day before. Tickets for two, please.""

Kino said, and the curator replied,

""The tour is free of charge for the day. Today is a holiday in commemoration of the war, after all.""

She then led Kino and Hermes in through the exit side. They made their way through the dimly lit corridor, as the lights had not yet been turned on. ""Please, go ahead.""

The curator said, switching on the lights on the display items.

The sign designated this section as [THE EVOLUTION OF WAR - A PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE]. The curator asked,

""I take it that you have seen the 'war' yesterday?""

Hermes immediately replied,

""Yes. We solved the mummy mystery, too.""

'I see,' the curator nodded to the motorrad's statement, then looked at Kino, as if she was urging the traveler on for a response.

""Is that what you and the people here would call a war? All I could see was a massacre of the defenseless Tatata people.""

Kino said, in expression and tone completely unchanged from the usual. Not condemning, nor showing anger, nor expressing disgust. It was simply the posing of a question.

The curator answered,

""That is true... Based only on your experience yesterday, it is likely for you to see it that way. But that is our 'war'.""

""How did things turn out this way? If you don't mind, I would like an explanation, please.""

Kino's tone was comparable to those of students asking a teacher about subjects they don't understand.

The curator turned on the lights inside the final display case, which featured contemporary history.

""As you saw the day before, the war between countries never seemed to be ending.""

The curator switched on the monitor, and the title [TWO MINUTES ON THE BATTLEFIELD] came on.

Then, on the pitch-black screen, shapes and colors slowly appeared. Several soldiers, their faces visibly frightened, were crammed in a trench in the wasteland, gripping long persuaders in their hands. A whistle sounded, and the soldiers ducked. The sound cut out for a brief moment, and the image shook, dust scattering. One among the soldiers seemed to be shouting. Then, the moment sound returned, all of the soldiers leapt out of the trench in unison and charged onward. The footage followed them, showing the backs of the soldiers as they ran. The soldiers could now be heard, screaming. So could a separate whizzing sound, as some black objects flew at high speed. One of them landed on the ground, rebound, and hit the soldier on the left side of the footage in his chest; only his lower half remained in the end.

""For many years, war broke out time and time again without an end to them in sight, taking countless lives in the process. The man who had lost his upper half just now was my husband.""

The footage suddenly distorted, sound disappeared, all of the screen turned pitch-black, then broke into static.

The monitor was turned off.

The curator waited until she had Kino attention, speaking up in a soothing voice when the traveler looked at her,

""I remember the wars of the past clearly. I remember everything from that time. I had four sons once. They were my pride and joy, irreplaceable by anything in the world. After I lost my husband, I lived only to raise my children into fine men.""

""......""

""But when the Hundred and Sixty-Ninth War began, those children of mine-- one after another-- volunteered for the defense forces, swearing revenge on the enemies of their father. The first to die was Sotos, my second son, shot by a sniper. The following day was Datos, my third son, blown to pieces when he stepped on a landmine.""

The wall of the display room, which had only been dimly lit, now had a large photograph projected onto it.

It was of the curator from when she was still young, with long hair. She was surrounded by her four sons. Each child was smiling heartily, flashing their white teeth. Their mother was, too.

""Utos, my eldest son, stayed on the frontlines to save his comrades and was blown apart along with the enemy by friendly fire. Yotos, my youngest, last remaining child, left saying that he would fight his brothers' shares, and that he would return alive. In the end, he never came back. The child was nine at the time...""

The curator spoke with a voice of detachment, appearing as if she was smiling under the dim light.

""As always, the war ended with the victor undecided. But we knew full well that the next one would soon begin. I saw no meaning in the continuation of this cycle of war. Why must the slaughters with no results repeat themselves? I saw off four children as they left for the battlefield, lost them all, and was made an honorary citizen. I used this position to appeal to everyone. 'Let us end our wars,' I said.""

""......""

""The wars did not end just like that, of course. If that was enough to end wars, then it would be strange for them not to already be over. I thought about the things that could serve as realistic alternatives to war, and in the end, I made a proposal.""

""Which was to raid the Tatata, wasn't it? That was your idea?""

""Yes, that was it. 'The Tatata are proxy enemy forces, and whichever side kills more is the victor of that war.' That way, the competitive spirit, animosity, and brutality intrinsic to us humans can be released. Also... when I announced my idea, there was a woman on the other side who happened to come up with a remarkably similar idea.""

Having said all that, the curator stepped forward, guiding Kino to the next display item.

""Fifteen years ago, when we first met each other, she showed me a photo. It was of her with her children-- they were all so adorable indeed, and I could see that they were lovely, precious treasures of hers. They too had all been killed in action.""

The monitor now showed a photograph from the newspaper, the issue in which the situation back then was announced. The curator in the picture, even thinner than she was now, was embracing a woman in exotic clothing.

""Our plan was tested and put into practice. That was fifteen years ago.""

The next monitor the curator switched on showed the scenes of this country in its present time. A peaceful town with happy residents, just as Kino saw for real.

""Since then, war never broke out between our nations. The countries proceeded to develop, their populations expanded. I'm sure young mothers today will never have to experience the same things I did. They can bring children into this world and raise them in happiness. And when the day comes, their own children will provide them with a proper burial. People die in the order in which they are born. That is what peace is-- what the present time of this country is. Kino, Hermes. This is all the History Museum has to offer.""

The curator folded her hands before her chest.

""Thank you for your visit.""

She said with a smile.

""May I ask a question?""

Kino said.

""Yes, please go ahead.""

""What of the Tatata people who were killed? I'm sure they have lives and families as well... don't they?""

""Yes, it is as you said. But peace does not come without a cost. For it to be achieved, there must be some sacrifice. In the past, they were our precious children. Young soldiers fought on the hellish battlefield, and died to protect their country.""

""......""

""But things are different now. The Tatata are unable to fight back, and that is why there is no need for anyone to fight them. Our children no longer need to die on the battlefield. And that is a wonderful thing indeed. If we do not acknowledge the sacrifice of the Tatata, and if that resulted in the two countries going to war once again, the number of victims would be far greater than the number of Tatata who die now.""

The curator said, reflecting thoroughly upon each and every word. Then she repeated,

""Peace requires sacrifice. We will not allow that sacrifice to be our children. If the death of the Tatata could serve to maintain our peace, them we shall welcome it with open arms.""

Kino thought about it for a moment, then expressed some opinions,

""Curator, I don't understand. I don't know whether you are wrong, or the people of the past were right.""

Hearing that, the curator slowly produced a smile. She stooped slightly, put her hands on Kino's thin shoulders, and said gently,

""It is reasonable for you to think so. But when you are a little older, you will come to understand my feelings.""

""You think so?""

""You will, Kino. When you conceive your child-- when you start feeling the warmth of that child inside you-- you will surely understand.""

Kino, regarded to here as a girl, did not reply.

===

Kino departed from the country, sent off by a crowd so large that one might think all of the townspeople had come. The sun was still fairly high in the sky.

Kino ran Hermes on the single straight path through the plain. A cloud of dust rose from beneath the motorrad's wheels.

They kept a consistently high speed from the time they left the walls until the sun had waned down a two-fist length from its zenith, but the scenery did not change at all. Only brown earth, bald mountains in the distance, and the occasional large metal cans whisked by.

""Hmm?""

Kino noticed that there was something in the direction they were heading. Then, after a short while, they could be identified as a gathering of people. Hermes noticed them as well.

""Someone's up ahead.""

Kino slacked off the accelerator. The traveler then noticed that they were the Tatata people.

A number of brawny Tatata youths had blocked the path. They carried either hefty axes or poles taller than themselves.

Kino brought Hermes to a stop right before them.

About twenty Tatata tribespeople were present, and to their side was a herd of domestic animals they had apparently ridden here.

Kino got down from Hermes, kicked down the motorrad's stand, then unbuttoned the coat and left it hanging on. The goggles and bandana were then removed. 

A young Tatata with a pole took a few steps toward Kino, then spoke up, 

""You will be coming with us to our village, and there, you will be torn from limb to limb while everyone watches you die."" 

Kino looked at the Tatata tribespeople. There were women, children, and the elderly among them. All were glaring at Kino. 

""Why?"" 

Kino asked, not seeming to be surprised. 

""For our revenge. So that we could satisfy our desire for revenge, even if only a little."" 

""I am not a citizen of that country."" 

Kino said calmly. The young man continued with a detached voice, suppressing his emotion, 

""We know that. You are a traveler, I take it? We do not know whether or not you are aware, but we despise that country. They slaughter us for no reason, and they dump our dead beyond reach. We can not even give our loved ones a burial..."" 

""......."" 

""But no matter how hard we fight, we can not win. So that is why we wish to kill someone-- anyone who passes through these parts by chance like you now-- so that we could dispel our anger, even if only a little. You are not at all in the wrong. You are simply unlucky."" 

He slowly approached Kino. 

Hermes spoke up, exasperated, 

""What're you gonna do, Kino? You gonna let them eat you or what?"" 

Kino did not answer Hermes' question, instead speaking up with raised voice, so as to address all the Tatata present, 

""We are now aware of your circumstances and feelings. But I have no desire to die here. The most I can do is promise to never forget the story of your people. Now, if I may excuse myself..."" 

Having said just that, Kino turned to Hermes. 

The Tatata youth drew near, swinging his pole with the intention to knock Kino out cold. Kino spun back around.

For the mere instant Kino looked up at him, their eyes met, the distance between them shorter than an arm's reach. The young man aimed for the head of his target, bringing down his pole together with a battle cry. 

""YAAHHH!""

Kino twisted slightly to the right, pulling Canon from its right thigh holster with blinding speed, then fired.

Accompaying the thunderous roar was the white smoke characteristic of liquid propellant, instantly filling the gap between them then just as quickly fading away.

The youth froze in his stance, still holding on to his pole. His face was raised up.

Then he fell over backward, raising a cloud of dust when he hit the ground. Blood oozed like a muddy stream from his upper jaw, overflowed from his mouth, stained his chest red, and was absorbed by the dry earth.

Kino, with Canon in right hand, watched on as the other Tatata tribespeople fled. Before long, they were out of sight.

""What're you gonna do with this guy? Bury him?""

Hermes asked.

""No, the others will probably come back later. To give him a burial.""

While Kino said that, the persuader was returned to its holster, its hammer slightly raised up and interposed with the tip of the holster's leather prominence.

Kino mounted Hermes, put on goggles and bandana, then said,

""Let's go.""

""Sure.""

Hermes replied without a moment's delay.

So the motorrad took off, leaving the dead body behind.

A cloud of dust rose in their wake. It blanketed over the collapsed, lifeless Tatata youth.

When the dust finally let up, the motorrad was no longer there to be seen."
64,v9c4,9,4,"The carpet of grass stretched as far as the eye could see. Layers of the green, lightly undulated land overlapped each other as they disappear toward the horizon.

The vast sky was in clear blue, strewn with drifting white clouds, so vivid to the point of dazzling. In the distance, above the horizon, a cumulonimbus cloud rose like a white-walled sanctuary. The incessant cry of cicadas filled the air.

The meadow had but a single road.

The road could barely be acknowledged as one, being so narrow that its earth surface was hardly visible. It ran straight, with occasional iterations of sudden curves, as if they were avoiding the masses of trees. It headed due west.

A single motorrad (Note: Two-wheeled vehicle. Refers to only ones that cannot fly) was running down the road. The motorrad cleared the curves at a considerable speed. It accelerated upon entering a long, straight path, its rear wheel scattering dirt.

The motorrad's rider wore a long, black vest. The collar was opened wide, so as to let air in. A thick belt wrapped around the hips, and on its backside was a hand persuader holster (Note: Persuaders are firearms. In this case, a handgun). Inside it was a thin-framed hand persuader, grip pointed upwards. Another one could be seen on its wielder's right thigh.

Worn under the vest was a white shirt. To keep both sleeves from flapping in the wind, several elastic bands were wrapped around them.

The rider's short, black hair was blown into disarray by the wind. On top of the slender, tough-looking face was a pair of silver-framed goggles with chipped-off plating; under it, the rider's eyes glared straight ahead.

Approaching a curve, the rider decelerated and leaned the motorrad down. Its rear wheel slid along slightly before they made it through the curve safely.

The motorrad was one without a back seat, but rather a pipe-framed carrier. Bound on it was a large bag and a rolled-up, light brown coat. The topmost part was fastened tightly, albeit crudely, by the sleeves cut off from the rider's vest, which was formerly a jacket. Under the carrier were boxes for storing additional luggage, installed to both sides of the rear wheel.

As if it was gliding, the motorrad kept on running through the meadow.

Suddenly, the rider's chin lifted up slightly. Letting go of the left handle, the hand tapped twice on the motorrad's gas tank, then pointed forward.

""I can see it now.""

The rider spoke to the motorrad.

""At long last.""

The motorrad replied.

Beyond their course, the blurry outline of white city walls started coming in to view.

The rider opened up the throttle.

===

""Is anyone there?""

The motorrad's rider shouted. The goggles were removed and hung around the neck. An attempt was made to rake the windblown hair into order, which resulted in no significant change.

Before the rider's eyes was an arched gate in the high walls. However, the thick doors, which should have been tightly shut, was wide open. Squinting beyond the dark gate, several stone houses could be seen. The guardhouse, which should have been stationed with persuader-armed guards, showed no sign of human presence.

The rider waited there for a few moments, arm raised only once to wipe off sweat on the brows.

""Looks like no one's there, Kino.""

Instead, the motorrad, leaning on the kickstand, was the one that answered.

""Strange.""

The rider, who was referred to as Kino, shouted out once more.

Only the sound of the calmly drifting wind could be heard.

""No answer.""

The motorrad made a minimal remark.

""How about we just go in? The gate's already open, after all.""

""That'd be unwise, Hermes. If you go into someone's house without permission, you won't be able to complain even if they shot you dead.""

'Sure...' muttered the motorrad, referred to as Hermes,

""But you can't get shot if there's no one there. Besides,""

""...Besides?""

Kino turned to Hermes, face painted with expectations.

""It's not like there's that many people who could kill you, Kino. Even if someone pulled a persuader on you from behind, you'd be able to turn and shoot first if it's the average deal. I guarantee it.""

""...Thanks for that.""

Smiling wryly, Kino tapped on the right thigh persuader holster, which contained a revolver-type hand persuader.

""Well, no way around it. We can't afford to stay here forever. How about we just barge in?""

""Let's go with that. We're in agreement now, then.""

""But no fighting back. If it looks like something's up, we run.""

""Whatever you prefer.""

Kino went through the gate, pushing Hermes along.

""Kino. I'm sure there'd be someone if we go to the center of town. We can just ask for entrance and staying clearance when that time comes. Mm-hmm.""

Hermes cracked a joke.

Leaving the shadow of the gate, Kino and Hermes made their way into the town in which the walls encompassed.

===

""Camping out in the streets, huh.""

Feeding kindling to the bonfire, Kino made a somewhat self-mocking remark. The surroundings, pitch black; the sky, full of stars, hid away here and there by the clouds.

""At least it's not your fault, Kino.""

Hermes stood to the side, all luggage unloaded, metallic parts twinking with reflections of the flame.

""What, so is it yours, Hermes?""

Kino fired back with a joke.

""No way. The residents of this country are the ones responsible. Here's a town so well-built, yet no one's living in it. It's an insult to the buildings, I say.""

Hermes made a somewhat resentful remark.

The place where Kino and Hermes set up camp was in the dead center of a large intersection.

Stone-paved roads, wide enough for several cars to pass side by side, stretched neatly in all four directions. Stone buildings lined along the sides of the roads, without a single gap between them. All were four-story-tall, of identical design, and showed a splendid sense of history. However, no light radiated from any window.

In the end, after having wandered around town for half the day, Kino and Hermes never managed to find a single person. There were not even signs of anyone having lived here recently.

Weary of exploring abandoned buildings, they'd set up camp here, where they could keep a clear watch on their surroundings. For some reason, there was a single spot in which the stone pavement crumbled into a hole. Using gathered dry wood, which seemed to be from roadside trees, they'd built a fire.

""A ghost town, huh...""

Kino muttered while splitting a block of clay-like portable ration. It was then thrown into the diner's mouth. There was no indication whatsoever of it being a palatable consumption.

""What're we gonna do tomorrow?""

Hermes asked Kino, now having finished the little meal.

""We haven't been to all the key places yet. Let's go check them out.""

""Might be a waste of time.""

""That's fine, too.""

Kino gave a short reply, then reached into the bag and pulled out a blanket. Walking over to under the eaves of a building in a corner, Hermes and the bonfire were left behind. Sitting down on the blanket that had been spread on the sidewalk, Kino muttered,

""I want a comfy bed with clean sheets...""

""My condolences. No hot water shower for you in the morning either, by the way.""

""...Oh well.""

Kino pulled the persuader out of the right thigh holster. A single-action revolver, one Kino referred to as 'Canon'. Grasped in hand, its wielder crawled into the blanket and lied down.

""Sleeping already?""

""Yeah, there's nothing to do. Keep watch for me. Good night, Hermes.""

Soon after having said that, Kino's well-ordered sleeping breath ensued.

===

The night of the ghost town passed in silence.

Audible only once in a while were murmurs of the phrase:

""It's soooooo boring...""

===

The next morning...

Kino woke at the break of dawn. The immediate surroundings were shrouded in mist.

Kino performed some light exercises, then persuader maintenance and practice. After which came breakfast, of the same menu as the night before.

When the sun appeared and the mist cleared, it was time to knock Hermes awake.

What remained of the bonfire was more or less cleaned up. Then, after all the luggage have been loaded up, they left the place behind.

Kino and Hermes spent half the day roamed around to places they haven't been to on the previous day. As before, they caught sight of no one. Nor was there any indication of people living there.

Then came noon, when they were starting to tire of their search, Kino and Hermes arrived at a large park.

Paths of white stone pavement stretched the extensive plot of green. It was wide enough that even with a motorrad, one would not be able to quickly reach the other end. Here, too, was in such a state that suggested no recent maintenance: the trees and grass were overgrown, the pond had dried up, and all of the flower beds had withered away.

Kino and Hermes proceeded to the park's inner area, discovering a structure of white limestone.

""This is amazing. Must have taken a lot of time and money. Truly splendid.""

Hermes sang it praises in astonishment.

Kino and Hermes were right in front of the white marble structure. One so large that Kino's field of vision saw no end of it. Its construct was nothing short of magnificence; from one end to another, from top to bottom, finely decorated.

""Maybe it was a palace or something.""

Kino muttered, while using the shirt sleeve to wipe off sweat on the forehead. The sun was at its zenith; its rays, dazzling.

""Probably. One fit for a rich king to live in. Well, can't say about the time period though.""

""So, maybe the monarchy was abolished and they turned it into a park... I wonder if there's any guide to tell us the history around here?""

Kino made a somewhat sarcastic remark, to which Hermes grumbled,

""Oh, c'mon. I wanna hear it, too.""

===

Kino explored the building, pushing Hermes along. 

The interior was no less extravagant than the exterior, having halls decorated with tens of stained-glass windows, bathrooms far larger than ones of the average house, and endless corridors.

Except, everything was covered in dust.

Having adequately inspected everything, Kino and Hermes found themselves coming out through the building's rear exit. It led to a terrace, on which the vast garden could be seen in its entirety.

""I see now...""

Hermes muttered frankly upon seeing the scene that spread before them. Kino said nothing, only leaning forward from the terrace to take a closer look.

It was a graveyard.

Amid the garden's greenery were simple mounds of earth, each marked as graves by thin wooden boards.

In the literal sense, the garden, one that spread as far as the eye could see, was filled with lines of such graves. Thousands, or even tens of thousands-- they were of an uncountable quantity.

Perhaps this garden had once been the royal hunting grounds, or a relaxation spot for the town's citizens. There was no written explanation. At this point in time, it was nothing more than a vast cemetery.

Kino let out a long, deep breath, then stood there to take in the scenery for a while longer.

The late summer sun started its gradual wane, quietly taking away the luminance from the sky. Light rapidly diminished under the building's shadow. As if sinking into darkness.

""Kino, most of the people who lived here are probably dead.""

""......""

""And those who survived must have already gone somewhere else. It's a deserted country.""

""...That might be the case. I wonder why?""

""Who knows...""

Kino turned around to face Hermes, leaning on the terrace's railing. 

""There's nothing else to gain in staying here. Let's just go to the next country.""

Kino denied with a light shake of the head,

""No. We'll stay here for the night, then leave tomorrow morning. It hasn't been three days yet."" 

Hermes asked, considerably puzzled,

""That again? That rule of staying in each country for three days... Is there any meaning to it?""

Kino smiled, albeit only faintly.

""A traveler I met long ago told me... That it's just about the right length for a stay.""

""Oh really.""

Hermes mumbled, showing little interest.

Still leaning on the railing, Kino turned around only from the neck up and took another look at the graves.

===

In a cabin near the park's entrance, Kino and Hermes woke up to face the morning of the third day.

Kino rose at dawn, unchanged from the usual. So did the persuader practice and maintenance routines. Which were followed by wiping the body clean with a damp cloth, then breakfast. Then, after all the luggage have been packed, Hermes was knocked awake.

Vest worn on top of shirt, belt wrapped around the wist. Persuader in holster, confirmed.

Kino departed for the west gate.

The morning of the ghost town passed in silence, as with ones of any other town.

Kino went well above the speed limit, letting the roar of Hermes' engine echo through the buildings without reservation.

===

Right when the wall came into view, Kino could see a single agricultural tractor parked in front of the gate.

The trailer on its rear piled high with fruits and vegetables. In the driver's seat sat a man with a hat pulled low over his eyes. He was around thirty years of age, wearing work clothes covered in dirt.

""Kino! A person! There is someone in this country!""

Hermes exclaimed in excitement, as if a person being there was an absurdity.

Kino and Hermes approached the tractor. The man was sleeping. To Hermes' exhaust, he rose with a scowl on his face, lightly shaking his head. He opened his eyes. Then, those eyes met with Kino's.

Kino cut Hermes' engine. An abrupt silence ensued.

""Apologies for waking you, but... Good morning.""

""Hello there.""

Kino and Hermes said their greetings.

""Well, what a surprise...""

The man's eyes opened, wide as can be. He was now in a state of wake, his drowsiness blown off in an instant.

""Ah--! Don't tell me, you're a traveler? ...Give me a sec!""

The man jumped down from the driver's seat. He stumbled once before trotting over to Kino.

""Hey, a good day to you! I'm this country's resident. The only resident. Welcome to my country! Really, thanks for visiting! I'm so glad to meet you!""

Kino had an expression of mixed feelings in reception of such an exaggerated greeting, delivered two days late.

And so Hermes asked,

""You said you're the only one in this country, mister? What in the world happened?""

With that, the man burst into tears, in an expression that could be either happiness or sadness. He asked Kino and Hermes,

""Are you two leaving soon? Any time to spare?""

""We can leave whenever, as long as it's within today.""

Hearing that, the man desperately begged,

""Th-- then! I'd want to-- to explain to you two what happened in this country! You'll listen, right? Please! I beg of you!""

Kino glanced at Hermes, turned back to the man, then smiled and said,

""Yes, please do. We'd very much like to know.""

===

In front of the gate, on the first floor of a building in a corner of the plaza, was what seemed to had once been an open-air cafe, chairs and tables stacked.

The man pulled the awning out across the sidewalk, then pulled out a table and some chairs. He lightly dusted off a chair and gestured for Kino to sit. Hermes stayed at Kino's side, leaning on the center stand.

The man rested his elbows on the table and folded his hands beneath his chin.

""Now, where to begin... Well, I suppose it's got to be the monarchy and the revolution.""

""So there was a monarchy, after all?""

Kino asked, and the man nodded.

""Right. Up until ten years ago, that is.""

""Then the revolution happened, hmm. Just as we thought, Kino.""

""Looks like you two already went to the central park. Surely you've seen them.""

The man slightly clouded up in both expression and voice.

""Yes, we did. Went in of our own accord.""

Hermes replied, in a tendency of sarcasm.

""It's fine, it's fine. Makes the story easier to tell, after all.""

""So, those are the graves of this country's people?""

The man nodded several times.

""Yeah... But... It's something that was inevitable.""

""Was it an epidemic or something of the sort?""

Kino asked. The man produced out quite the sorrowful expression, saying,

""No, that's not it. Only a single person died of illness... Let me tell you about it, all in order.""

===

""Since its founding, this country's government has always been a monarchy. A single king would reign over the land and all of its people. Among the several tens of kings we had, there were a few of admirable rule; they were beloved by the people. But the overwhelming majority were not like that... Especially the bastard who took the throne fourteen years ago, the lowest of them all. Maybe because he was crown prince for a very long time, he did whatever he liked the moment he became king. Those who opposed him were killed. Back then there were economic difficulties due to bad harvests, but he ignored them all, indulging in his amusements. The poor crops went on for three years, and most people were starving. But of course, that bastard didn't care. He probably didn't even know what the word 'starve' means.""

""If they have no bread, let them eat cake.""

As Hermes poked fun at the situation, the man grinned,

""Quite a good one you got there.""

Hermes then gave a short reply of thanks.

""Eleven years ago, life got so difficult that a group of farmers begged the king to reduce taxes, but they were all killed. We were at the peak of our anger. We could no longer abide the king's violence. The only thing we could do about this situation was no other than to overthrow the king and the monarchy system, and so the plot for a real revolution was set in motion. At the time, I was studying literature in university. My household was relatively well-off, but I felt the same pain of the poor. And so I was involved in the plotting from a fairly early stage.""

""Mm~hmm.""

""What if you'd been caught?""

To Kino's question, the man's face darkened.

""The death penalty, of course. Several of my friends were arrested and executed. Do you know the traditional method of execution in this country? They kill you by tying up your legs and hands, hanging you upside down, then dropping you down head first in the middle of the street. In this country, your family would be executed as well. I've seen it again and again, the public execution in the dead center of the intersection. Your friends' families are the first to be dropped. Their parents, spouses, children, one by one in order... Among them, some of my friends would spot me and the others in the crowd, right before they were blindfolded. It felt like something's been cut off between us at the moment they're dropped down, and in the next, I watched their skulls and necks crack and break.""

""......""

""One spring morning ten years ago, our uprising finally began. First of all, we attacked the guards' armories. Of course, it was for getting our hands on persuaders and ammunition. Before then, the general population was forbidden from owning weapons, you see. It was only natural, I suppose. The worse those good-for-nothings in power are, the more they are afraid of an armed populace. Anyway, we succeeded in obtaining persuaders from each of the armories. We got some of the guards to coming over to our side as well. Then, we were supposed to rush the palace in one go and seize the king. But the plan was called off.""

As the man spoke up to this point, he lightly smiled.

""Called off? But why? Because it looked like it's going to rain?""

Hermes asked in surprise.

""...This isn't like hanging out the laundry, Hermes.""

Kino said with a bitter face, then turned to the man,

""It was no longer necessary to do so, yes? Because the king ran away?""

The man raised his index finger and laughed delightfully,

""Correct. It was as you said.""

""How'd you know that, Kino?""

""It's because the building didn't suffer any damage.""

'I see...' Hermes murmured.

""The king and his family-- or should I say, his treasures-- were hidden in the back of a truck that was headed outside the country. He was found rather quickly. Ha ha ha, well of course. Anyone would be suspicious if they saw a person buried in a pile of jewels and vegetables. And so the revolution succeeded with very few sacrifices.""

""Now that's amazing. What's next? What happened after that?""

Hermes asked, as if urging the speaker on.

""After that, we started our new way of life, and our new way to manage our country, by creating a completely new government system. One with policies not dictated by a specific person, but agreed upon and enforced by all. 'Never again shall a single person rule the nation. The nation belongs to all.' If someone were to have an idea, it would be made known to everyone, then there would be an investigation to measure how many approve of it. If it was approved by the majority, then the method would be put into use. The first thing we decided on was what we would do with the king whom we've captured.""

""What was the verdict?""

Kino asked. The man narrowed his eyes,

""Results of the vote were ninety-eight percent in favor of execution. The king, his followers, and their families.""

""As I thought.""

Hermes mumbled.

""The royal family were hanged up and dropped. We thought that the age of fear and despair was over at last... After that, it was busy work. Everyone agreed upon numerous things. First up was the constitution. The initial clause stated that the nation belonged to everyone, and all administration would take place by majority rule. Then, the tax system. Police. National defense. Judgment by law. It was so much fun when we were deciding on the educational system. Deciding on which kind of training we should give to the children, who carry the nation's future on their shoulders...  Ahh, it was so much fun...""

The man then closed his eyes. He nodded to himself several times, then opened his eyes again and looked at Kino.

Kino leaned slightly forward.

""What happened after that?""

The man opened his canteen and took several drinks. He then let out a single, long breath.

""Everything went well for a while... Then one day, suddenly came those people who said the most ridiculous thing. Their proposal went like this: 'It takes too much time to get a direct vote from everyone. How about we vote to select someone as a leader, then entrust him or her with management of the country for a number of years?'""

""That proposal... did it go through?""

""As if! That'd be plain madness, nothing else to say about it. If we went with it, then what if the chosen leader turned out to be a madman? If we give all the power to one person, who'd be the one to stop him when he runs wild? Those who proposed it were probably meaning to bring back the absolute presence of a 'king' to the country, so that they could have special privileges in life under the king's patronage. A despicable thought. Naturally, it didn't go through, opposed by the majority.""

""So that's it...""

""But we also came to the decision that the possession of such treacherous thoughts was in itself a danger to the country's future. All of them were charged with treason against the nation.""

Kino glanced at Hermes, then asked the man,

""Where did that end up?""

""The majority deemed them guilty.""

""And?""

Hermes asked.

""The death penalty. Death penalty for all of them.""

""...The traditional way, tied and dropped, family included...?""

As the answer Kino's question,

""Oh, yes. A fitting end for those who go against the nation.""

The man spat those words out. But soon enough, he produced an expression of loneliness, then went on,

""But you see, it's unfortunate that those who oppose the nation didn't stop showing up. One time, came those who said the death penalty system should be abolished. How outrageous. If we got rid of the death penalty, we would have no choice but to leave traitors alive until who-knows-when. Those who would say such a thing were deemed traitors. And so, all of them later received the death penalty by vote. Another time, came those who were against our new tax system. They complained that their tax rates were too high for them to pay, and said that they're not paying. They were objecting to what's been decided by the majority rule. What arrogance, only caring about their own well-being. Of course, we couldn't let that past us. They were executed.""

""......""

""Running a country sure is a lot of trouble.""

Hermes said. The man nimbly raised his index finger,

""It sure was. But if we don't keep a firm grip, mistakes would be made. If we end up with something we can't fix, then it'll be too late.""

""What happened next?""

Kino asked.

""Hm. We tried our best to make this country a splendid one, in a way or another... But still, those who oppose the nation never stopped popping up. Even ones who used to so firmly hold the same beliefs as all of us, rose in our opposition, trying to lead the country down the wrong direction. It ached my heart, to have to execute old comrades. However, I never let my personal feelings drive me away from what must be done. Absolutely not.""

""And so, the graves eventually ran out?""

""I'm afraid it's as you said. Fortunately, we had the former palace, which was turned into the central park. We began using the rear garden, which we had initially planned to use as farmland. Those who disagreed were executed.""

""Up to now, how many executions were there?""

The man thought over Kino's question for a while.

""Who knows? If it's from the kings' time, then it's too many to count.""

""No, no. Just from the new government's formation is fine.""

""Oh. Thirteen-thousand and sixty-four.""

The man answered promptly.

""What kind of vote decided the last one?""

""The last one... was exactly a year ago. By that time, the country's population consisted of me, my beloved wife, and an unmarried man who'd been a long time friend of mine. The three of us intended to hang on and support the country. But one day, that man announced that he was leaving the country. We tried again and again to persuade him against going. But that bastard's wicked determination was solid. To abandon your country-- to abandon your duty-- we couldn't forgive that. As result of the vote, two against one, it was decided that the bastard would receive the death penalty.""

""Your wife... is she still here?""

The man slowly stretched his neck.

""No, not anymore... It's been about half a year. She died of sickness. A common cold. I'm not a doctor, so I couldn't do anything... Ahhh... Damn it... Damn it all...""

Before long, the man quietly burst into tears.

===

""Thank you for telling us your story. We now understand a lot more.""

To the man who was sobbing with his face flat on the table, Kino bowed lightly, then said while standing up from the chair,

""Hermes, it's about time.""

With that, the man raised his head.

""I'm... I'm the only one left in this country. I'm so lonely...""

""......""

""However, to do the right thing, there are times when a person must stand firm against hardships. This country must overcome the times of difficulty.""

Finally dried off his tears, the man made a proposal to Kino and Hermes.

""You two! Please, please become this country's residents. Then let's restore this country together. Everyone here are honored citizens. Come on, won't you agree...?""

Kino and Hermes gave their replies almost at the same time.

""No, thank you."" ""No way.""

For a moment, the man produced an expression of sadness, and of betrayed expectations.

""I... I see. If the two of you are saying that, then it can't be helped. Th-- then...""

The man gave it a little thought, then asked,

""It wouldn't hurt for you two to delay your leave for about a year. How about it?""

""That's out of the question."" ""I'm with Kino.""

""You two... Please, stay for another week. You could use anything here however you'd like.""

""I'll decline the offer."" ""No need.""

""Th-- three more days... How about we eat the finest meals together here?""

""Uh-- ...No, no thank you."" ""We shall depart before Kino reconsiders.""

""If you stay in this country, I'm willing to serve you for a while as a loyal slave.""

""I'll have to refuse."" ""I'm not into that kinda play, man.""

--GONK!

Kino struck Hermes' tank. Then frowned and waved the stinging hand.

""It's about time for us to leave. Sorry about your requests, but we can't accept any of them. Still, we offer our deepest gratitude for letting us hear your story.""

Kino bowed lightly once more.

""Just another day! Please, stay in this country just for one more day. Then I can tell you more about how wonderful this country is. Please...""

""We can't afford to do so. We've already stayed for three days.""

Kino said just that, then turned to Hermes.

""I don't really get it either, but that's usually how we roll. Sorry 'bout that, mister.""

The man looked like he was about to burst out crying once again. Then, he seemed to want to say something, but his mouth only flapped about.

""Let's go.""

As Kino said that and got on Hermes, the man reached into his bag, pulling out a hand persuader. A break action revolver frame with juxtaposed cylinders, one capable of sixteen consecutive shots.

Although he pulled it out, that was all he did with it. He did not point it at Kino's back, nor did he place his index and middle fingers on its heavy trigger. 

""So, you plan on threatening us now?""

Kino turned back, only in line of sight, to the man, asking him with a detached voice, while the right hand silently reached for the thigh holster.

For a moment, the man looked down at his persuader, the one held in both his hands. Then, in a struggle, he shook his head repeatedly.

""No, no... I can't, I can't, I can't! If I use it, then I'll be the same as that fool of a king and his followers. It's wrong to use violence to force your thinking on others! It's wrong! A fool's solution! I can't! ...That's right, everything must be chosen by desire of the majority. The paths we take must be peacefully decided by the consensus. It is the only way, so that the fatal mistakes of our past would not recur! Isn't that right?""

Listlessly, the man lowered his persuader. As he broke it open, it was apparent that not one bullet had been loaded.

Kino turned around, smiled only slightly, then said,

""Are you sure about asking us that? What if Hermes and I said 'That's not right. You're mistaken,' then what would you do about it?""

Taken aback, the man dropped his persuader to the ground. Simultaneously with the resonance of a crack, the man's face turned pale; he trembled so hard that his teeth rattled.

Shortly after, he squeezed out all the courage in his being, shouting at the top of his lungs.

""G-- Go away! P-- p-- people like you can g-- go away for all I care! Disappear! Get out of th-th-th-- this country! Be gone! And never come back again!""

""We'll do just that."" ""Sure thing.""

Kino got on Hermes and started the engine.

The noisy engine roared.

""Let's run for it.""

Kino whispered, then took off with Hermes.

While on the run, the words that Hermes uttered were,

""Farewell, Your Majesty.""

The man never heard it.

===

The man watched as the motorrad ran off, until he could not see it any longer. In his hand was his persuader, fully loaded just now. He gripped it tight, ready to fire at any time.

The man screamed,

""You bastards! I swear... If you come back, I'll shoot! I'll kill you!""

He continued to glare in the motorrad's direction, even though it was long out of sight.

The travelers never returned.

===

The motorrad ran down the meadow path for a while, then came to a stop. Kino, goggles taken off, looked at what laid ahead: a fork in the road.

Stepping away from Hermes, Kino confirmed their orientations with a compass. One road headed due west-southwest, the other west-northwest; both stretched endlessly. Nothing but the horizon could be seen beyond the vast grassland.

""Which way should we go?""

Hermes asked. Kino looked at the map, one that was self-drawn by hand and marked with only the most important routes, then mumbled with curiosity,

""Strange... There was supposed to be only one road.""

""Who told you that?""

""That merchant from a while back. You know, the one who brought along pandas and kangaroos.""

As Kino said so, Hermes poked back in a playful tone,

""Aha, looks like you've been fooled. You're such a sucker, Kino.""

""No, no, the directions were all matched up until now. Heading west from that last country, we should come across a lake with purple water, and then we should reach a large city-state. One of these two have got to be right.""

Having said that, Kino took another look at the roads.

""The right, I guess. It's wide."" ""The left, probably. The dirt is harder.""

Kino and Hermes said, both at the same time.

""......"" ""......""

And fell silent, both at the same time.

A short while later, Kino spoke up,

""Got it. Let's go left.""

""Huh--?""

""What do you mean, 'huh'?""

Hermes answered the question frankly,

""It's because you decided on a road so quickly this time, Kino. Normally you'd dither about until you get hungry. What kind of wind blew to turn you over a new beef?"" 

""...New leaf?""

""Yeah, that.""

Having said that, Hermes fell silent for a moment, then,

""Well?""

'Hrm...' Kino groaned.

""Well, sticking around here will diminish our supplies, so I thought it'd be best to just go with one. Besides, it's hot. And you'd rather be running, wouldn't you, Hermes?""

""That's true... But what if it turned out to be the wrong way?""

Hermes said, feeling quite uneasy. Kino gazed into the distance.

""Let's see... If we don't find a lake after running for a while, or if the road changed its direction along the way, then we'll come back here. We'll ask for directions if we're lucky to meet someone.""

""Don't knock it 'till you've tried it, I see. Idea approved. Let's go with it.""

With Hermes saying that, Kino affirmed the agreement, put away the map and compass, strapped on the goggles, and mounted on Hermes.

Kino then took off with Hermes. Down the right path.

""Ah? Ahh!! Kino--! You tricked me!""

Hermes screamed.

""That's not true. I didn't mean to trick you. Don't knock it 'till you've tried it, right? So it doesn't matter which one we try first, does it?""

""Now that's no fair! That's still no reason to go right!""

Disregarding Hermes' justified protests, Kino accelerated even further."
65,v9c5,9,5,"The forest was one full of giant trees.

With trunks as thick as double beds, they stood tall like pillars of a shrine, except that they were scattered around without any sense of regularity.

If one were to look up, they would see nothing but the color green. The lowest branches and leaves were twenty meters above ground, completely obscuring the sky. Since no more than the dimmest sunlight ever hit the ground, no grass grew on any surface. The black, damp, bare earth spread forth endlessly. It was a world of glaring unnatural contrast between black and green, created by nature itself.

""I don't really like riding in the woods. You know why, Hermes?""

The speaker, standing beside one of the giant trees, had short hair, and was fifteen to sixteen years of age.

The person was of slender figure, wearing a black jacket with a belt wrapped around the hips. For such a thin waist, the belt was a thick one. On the hip's backside and the right thigh were holsters. Inside them, persuaders (Note: Persuaders are firearms. In this case, handguns) were kept in place. 

Right to the side was a single motorrad, (Note: Two-wheeled vehicle. Refers to only ones that cannot fly) leaning on its center stand. One without a rear seat, but rather a carrier. Bound on it was a somewhat dirty bag. Its engine was still active, its rear wheel left spinning idly.

""Is it the hairy caterpillars, Kino?""

The motorrad, referred to as Hermes, replied.

""That's not it... Well, that's one thing. The main thing is, it's easy to lose your sense of direction in a forest. You might think you're heading west, but before you know it, you ended up heading south. Not seeing the sun also makes it more difficult.""

Said the person, referred to as Kino, while putting on a hat with a small visor and flaps that covered both ears.

""Sense of direction, huh.""

""That's right, Hermes. If we head due north, we'll be out of this forest of giant trees. Then, we should come across a road.""

""Should, huh.""

Kino took out a compass from the chest pocket, stepped away from Hermes, and confirmed the direction of north.

""Let's go.""

Kino looked back once more to confirm that nothing was left behind. And also to confirm that the luggage fastened to Hermes, and the coat tied on top of them all, did not fall off.

With gloves fitted back on, Kino mounted on Hermes and leaned forward, then kicked up the stand. At the same time, the clutch was squeezed. The brakes were checked by running ahead for a short while. Lastly, the goggles were strapped on.

Kino took off on Hermes.

Then, after going ahead only a short distance, they stopped.

Kino got down from Hermes, stepped away shortly, then confirmed their bearings with the compass.

Kino then jumped back on, ran ahead for a short while, stopped, stepped away shortly, and confirmed the direction. The same process repeated over and over.

""Gah, what a drag...""

Even while complaining as such, Kino never cut any corners in the process; it was done with great precision.

""Your efforts are much appreciated.""

Running onward after finishing the hundred-and-eighth direction check, amid the black and green, Kino noticed a white line in the direction they were headed towards. Before long, it widened vertically, becoming a radiant band of light.

Kino throttled down the speed. At the same time when the rider's eyes were adjusted to the brightness, the motorrad went past the last giant tree, at last leaving the forest.

At the north end of the forest, there was no road.

What appeared before Kino was none other than an ordinary, overgrown, dense jungle.

""Nope, no road. Did we go the wrong way?""

Hermes grumbled.

""No... We'll probably be fine. Look,""

Kino signaled Hermes to look downwards.

Amid the overgrown grass, a reddish brown strip of something thin could be seen. A short space apart from it was another one. Lined side by side like that, they must be...

""Rails! Railway tracks!""

""Correct.""

Kicking the ground, Kino slowly pushed Hermes backwards.

""When the person who gave us the directions said, 'A motorrad will make it. You'll reach a wide path soon enough,' this must be it. People must be using it as a path through the jungle.""

""So that's it... But won't there be trains coming through?""

""The grass is way overgrown, and the rails are all rusty. I don't think it's in use anymore... Hy-up.""

Kino lifted Hermes' front wheel up, rolling in between the rails, faced west. Looking at it more closely, the grass was neatly lined along the tracks, as if it was a green road through the jungle.

""Well, this is nice. At least we don't have to worry about losing our 'sense of direction' now eh, Kino?""

Kino nodded before taking off on Hermes. So as to not have the front wheels trip on the rails, the run was a cautious one. The speed was not raised above the moderate level.

Trampling over the robust grass, Kino and Hermes ran onwards.

By the time the sun rose up to its zenith, they encountered the first man.

It was Hermes who first noticed him.

===

Just as they cleared a curve in the jungle, Hermes signaled,

""Someone's ahead.""

Seeing a person's figure in the distance straight ahead, Kino applied the brakes.

As they slowly approached, the man could be seen crouching down, preoccupied with something. He looked up for only a moment. Parked behind him was a cart fitted with train wheels, fully loaded with cargo.

Kino stopped Hermes just in front of the man, cut the engine, and dismounted.

""Hello.""

Greeted by Kino, the man stood up.

He was of old age and short stature. His face was of finely chiseled, albeit wrinkled, features. He possessed small, gray eyes.

His long hair was almost entirely white; his beard and mustache had been left untrimmed. He wore a small, black hat. His worn-out clothes of the same black were patched up here and there, but it was apparent that the shirt and trousers were once fine pieces of craft.

""Greetings, traveler.""

The old man said just that.

Kino intended to spark further conversation with the old man, but noticed something before then,

""Ah--!""

And exclaimed in considerable surprise. Hermes also noticed it at about the same time, and was rendered speechless.

The old man slowly turned around to look at what Kino and Hermes were looking at. He then looked back at the young ones, who were now looking at him, speaking to them nonchalantly.

""Yep. I did all that...""

Kino looked at the old man for a moment, then took another look at what he claimed to have done and blurted out,

""Unbelievable...""

What laid beyond Kino and Hermes' sights were rails. But unlike the way they came, not one blade of grass grew in the opposite direction. Crossties could be seen lining up in a frighteningly uniform interval, neatly blanketing the gravel.

The twin lines of metal were shining, as if they'd just been delivered from the foundry. Touched by the sunlight, they gained a brilliant black luster on both their tops and sides. They stretched away as far as Kino's eyes could see.

""Sorry, but it's not easy to remove the cart. Really sorry 'bout that, traveler. Could you take your motorrad friend off the rails for a moment?""

""--Huh? Ah, yes. I certainly can.""

Kino said, flustered. The old man crouched down again, and Kino approached him, bowing down and asked,

""Excuse me, but there's something I'd like to ask... Would you mind?""

""What is it? As long as it's something I know...""

""Um, did you... pull the grass and polish the rails, all by yourself?""

Kino asked, pointing at the rails behind the old man.

""Yep. It's my job, after all.""

The old man said, making no fuss of it.

""Job, you say...?""

""That's right. Been doing this since forever.""

While saying so, the old man plucked off the grass at his feet.

Kino looked at the cart. The cargo loaded on it seemed to be supplies for the old man's necessities. Then, after looking back at Hermes, Kino brought up a question which the motorrad would likely want answered,

""By forever, how long do you suppose it's been?""

""Fifty years, I reckon.""

The old man answered, absent-mindedly.

""Fifty years!?""

Hermes exclaimed, asking for confirmation.

""Don't know how long exactly, but that ought to be about right. I only counted the winters, y'see...""

""...All those fifty years, you've been doing nothing but working on the rails?""

Kino asked.

""Ah? Yep. Joined the railroad company when I was eighteen. They said they had a railroad that wasn't being used now but might be used again soon, and told me to polish as much of them as I could. They haven't told me to stop yet, so I'm keeping at it.""

""You've never gone back to your hometown?""

""Nope. At the time, I've got a wife and child. Gotta make sure they've got enough to eat, no matter what's necessary. Wonder how they're doin' right now... Should be gettin' my wages though. So they ought to not be having trouble with their livelihood, at least.""

""......""

Kino and Hermes just stood there, not saying anything.

""So, where're you headed to, traveler?""

The old man asked, making no fuss of it.

===

The motrrad ran between two shining rails.

Kino and Hermes had been on the move since sunrise. Only when they came across a streamlet did they stop, to rest and to draw water.

The rails stretched onward through the jungle, winding around gently. The gray gravel created a path, guiding Kino and Hermes on their way.

""We owe a lot to that old man yesterday, eh?""

Hermes said, for the umpteenth time in this day alone. Thanks to the rails that had been polished so thoroughly that they reflected the sky, and the fact that the grass had been all plucked off, their run had been far easier compared to that of the past day. Amid the crossties' systematic vibrations, Kino and Hermes ran onwards.

By the time Kino had begun to feel hungry, they encountered the second man.

It was Kino who first noticed him.

===

Just as they cleared a fairly abrupt curve, Kino suddenly applied the brakes. Hermes then noticed the man, who was beside the cart parked atop the rails.

Turning around in surprise, the man leaned his pole tool on the cart, then spread his hands out as a gesture to stop.

Kino stopped Hermes just in front of the man, cut the engine, and dismounted.

""Hello.""

Kino bowed lightly.

""Ah, hello, traveler.""

The man was of old age. He was taller than Kino, with a frame so thin to the point of being gangly. Little facial hair grew above his mouth. A hat was placed loosely on his bald head.

He wore clothes of matching black, the same type as the old man from the previous day. This one, too, was patched up here and there.

Kino intended to spark further conversation with the old man. But it was then that Hermes noticed something and cried out,

""Kino! The rails--!""

'The rails?' Kino wondered what was up. Body slanted slightly to look past the cart, Kino soon realized that the shining rails had been cut short. No crossties either. Only gravel stretched onward through the jungle.

""The rails are all gone...""

""Right. I tore them off.""

The old man answered to Kino's mutters. Then, while Kino was still standing there dumbfounded, he went on,

""The cart doesn't come off the rails, I'm afraid. Sorry, but I have to ask you to go around.""

Having said that, the old man picked up his long iron rod, which was bent only slightly at its tips. He then moved behind the cart, which was fully loaded with cargo.

Kino promptly started Hermes' engine, rode over the rails, and also went around the cart.

The old man wedged the bent tip of his rod under one side of the rails. Then,

""Ngh--!""

Together with a grunt, he applied weight onto the rod. A section of the rail disconnected, tumbling down beside the raised gravel mound.

As Kino looked more closely, there were other pieces of the rail, which had been torn off prior, lying around up ahead. They possessed no shine, covered up in the jungle's red soil. The old man tore the other side of the rail off as well.

""There's something I'd like to ask...""

Kino asked. The old man turned towards Kino.

""Um, why are you tearing off the rails?""

""It's my job, you see. Been doing this all by myself since forever. I'm clearing off the crossties, too.""

Hermes whispered so that only Kino would hear,

""I have a bad feeling about this...""

""By forever... how long do you suppose it's been?""

""Fifty years, was it...? I'm not really sure.""

""......""

""I joined the railroad company when I was sixteen. They said they had a railroad that they're not going to use any more, and ordered me to tear them up. It was my first job, so I came in doing it with high spirits. They haven't told me to stop yet though.""

""You've never gone home?""

Hermes asked.

""Right. I've got five little brothers, you see. Got to earn money to feed them. I can't afford to take a vacation.""

""Is that so...""

After having said that, Kino casually followed up with a question,

""These rails sure are clean for ones not used in a long time, don't you think?""

The old man replied,

""Right, always have been. Strange stuff. Still, it makes them easier to take off.""

""......""

Kino and Hermes just stood there, not saying anything.

""So, where're you headed to, traveler?""

The old man asked, quietly.

===

The motrrad ran on the gray path of gravel.

Kino and Hermes had been on the move since sunrise. They almost never took a break.

The road that stretched onward through the jungle was relatively straight. Scattered about to its sides were torn-off rails and dismantled crossties. There were also occasional piles of rail spikes.

""It's hard to drive...""

Kino said, for the umpteenth time in this day alone.

The tires' grip was no good on the gravel road without crossties, slipping even with the slightest slant through a curve. Kino kept their speed to a minimum and maintained a nervous grip on the handles.

By the time Hermes was about to propose that they took a break, they encountered the third man.

Kino and Hermes noticed him at the same time.

===

Beyond the straight gravel path, the figure of a person could be seen.

As Kino promptly eased up the accelerator, Hermes said nothing.

They slowly approached the man sitting on the gravel, apparently resting. As he noticed Kino and Hermes, he waved his hand to them.

Kino stopped Hermes just in front of the man, cut the engine, and dismounted.

""Hello.""

""Hey there, traveler!""

The man gave his reply while standing up.

The man was of old age, but still robust. His torso was bare, and his arms and shoulders rippled with muscle. If one didn't see the wrinkles carved into his face, he could have even said that he was middle-aged, still in the prime of his life. He wore a pair of black trousers, the same as the old men from yesterday and the day before. The hems were quite worn-out.

Kino intended to spark further conversation with the old man. But it was then that both Kino and Hermes noticed something at the same time,

""The rails are still there..."" ""The rails are still there...""

They muttered simultaneously.

Behind the old man was a cart fully loaded with cargo. The rails started from that point, stretching onward through the jungle.

Hefting a massive hammer that had been lying on the ground beside him, the man said cheerily,

""Yup. I did that.""

""You're replacing them?""

""Replacing them, yeah. So that the train can run through. Laying down the crossties, placing the rails, and hammering down the spikes.""

""All by yourself?""

Hermes asked.

""Now, it's nothing once you've gotten used to it. I have all the materials right here. Here, here, and here.""

The old man pointed at the crossties, rails, and spikes scattered about.

""I have a really bad feeling about this...""

Hermes whispered.

Kino then asked,

""Um, is this your job?""

""Of course. Been since forever.""

The man answered, laughing.

""By forever, you suppose...""

""Give or take a few, I'd say fifty years? I'm pretty bad at maths, you see.""

""......""

""I got the job at the railroad company when I was fifteen, I think. They said they had a railroad that they might be using again, and they're relying on me to restore it. They haven't told me to stop yet, so I'm keeping at it.""

""I take it that you've never gone back to your hometown?""

Kino asked, as if wanting to confirm something.

""Well, yeah. My parents were sick, you see. They couldn't work, so I've got to earn enough for three.""

""Is that so...""

After Kino said that, Hermes spoke up casually,

""Keep up the good work, yeah?""

""Will do. Thanks.""

Not saying anything more, Kino started Hermes' engine.

""So, where're you headed to, traveler?""

The old man asked, smiling and laughing."
66,v9c6,9,6,"A brown line stretched through the sea of green.

It was a path of simple packed dirt, running straight eastward. All around it was knee-high grass as far as the eye can see, swaying gently as if to show passage of the wind. Near or far, not a single tree to be seen.

In the middle of the road, a single motorrad (Note: Two-wheeled vehicle. Refers to only ones that cannot fly) was running. A slightly dirty bag was fastened to the carrier on its rear.

The motorrad roared in engine sound as it ran with considerable speed, but occasionally it would wane to the left or right. Each time, the rider would steer the handle in a panic, with body slanted, straightening it back to the path.

The rider had a slender figure. Wearing a black jacket, waist wrapped in a thick belt. Strapped to the belt were multiple pouches, and on its backside was a hand persuader holster (Note: Persuaders are firearms. In this case, a handgun). Inside it was an automatic-type persuader, grip pointed upwards.

On the rider's right thigh was another holster; inserted in it was a revolver-type hand persuader. So as to not have it slide out, its hammer was tied down by the short string that extended from the holster.

The rider's hat was similar to that of an aviator's, brimmed only on its front and attached with ear flaps on its sides for protection against cold. They were held down by the band of the goggles, with the parts sticking out fluttering violently in the wind. But on the contrary, the hat itself was protected from being blown away by wind pressure.

Under the goggles was a youthful face. Large eyes and features gave a tough impression, but right now that face was wearing an expression of fatigue.

The motorrad spoke to its rider.

""Seriously, I don't know what you're thinking, Kino. You have food, so you should just eat.""

The rider, one who was referred to as Kino, replied.

""I can see a country right over there; wouldn't feel right to eat portable rations now.""

Beyond the road they were proceeding down, a vague image of a town's outer wall could be seen.

""Besides, survival foods are things for eating as a last resort.""

At that moment, the front wheel hit a bump in the road, throwing the motorrad off-balance once more. Kino corrected it in a panic.

""Uwah!""

""Sorry, Hermes.""

Kino throttled down slightly. The motorrad, referred to as Hermes, grumbled.

""Great, just great. We don't even know if that country is going to have food or not. What do you plan to do if it's deserted?""

""Well, whatever will be...""

""Whatever will be?""

""...Will be. That's it.""

===

Reaching the outer wall, Kino brought Hermes to a standstill. In front of the rampart was a moat, with a drawbridge extending across.

Noticing a small building just before the bridge, Kino dismounted. Hermes staggered immediately, making Kino realize that the kickstand had yet to be dropped down. Unable to hold Hermes up due to lack of energy, both of them collapsed to the left side just like that.

""Oh, the horror! To think the mighty Kino has fallen over. Now, hurry and get me up, c'mon!""

Hermes, now lying down to the side, spoke in a genuinely astounded tone. Kino immediately raised Hermes up, but stopped in the middle of the movement.

""What's up?""

Hermes asked. Kino answered in a thin voice.

""Hungry, no energy...""

""And that's why I told you to eat when you're supposed to... Listen up, Kino, I already told you many times that riding motorrads is a sport. Not on the level of bicycles, but quite a lot of your energy will be drained just by riding along. You'll run out of strength before you know it, and your mind will go all numb. When that happens, you won't even be able to do normally mundane tasks. As a result, you'll easily make mistakes which leads to accidents... Hello? Kino, you listening?""

===

There was nobody in the building.

Instead, a large vending machine-like apparatus was there. It activated the moment Kino entered, asking several simple questions then almost immediately granting clearance to enter the country. The drawbridge lowered.

""Now that was quick.""

Hermes, leaned on the kickstand, said as Kino returned.

""It's strange.""

Kino mounted and started the engine.

""What is?""

""There wasn't a single person in there. Just a machine.""

Kino took off with Hermes, crossing the bridge.

""Maybe we won't be seeing anyone when we get into town either.""

Hermes said, meaning it as a joke.

But those words proved to be true.

===

""You ate?""

""Yup.""

Kino answered with satisfaction, returning to Hermes who had been parked in front of the building.

""Anyone in there?""

""No one.""

Kino gave a short response, mounted Hermes, then looked around.

There was a single paved road, with several one-story buildings erected on both sides. The building Kino just came out from had a sign saying ""restaurant"".

Along the roadside were spacious walkways, with streetlights and trees lined uniformly. Slightly ahead is a crossroad, complete with traffic lights. The path ran straight. Beyond it is a forest. The was nothing but green to be seen.

To their backs was the country's wall they had just passed through, its ends in either direction unseen. Even by looking from here, one would know that the town was extremely large and flat.

""No one was in there, but you were served food just fine?""

""Yeah. The machines took care of everything. Food was delicious, too.""

""Man, this place is strange.""

===

A short time before, when Kino and Hermes first entered the country, there was no one there. The town was elegant, its roads well-maintained. However, humans were nowhere to be seen.

It was then that a car approached, stopping in front of Kino and Hermes. The door opened, but no one came out of it. Instead, another machine appeared, and after saying its welcomes to the town's visitors, presented them with a map of the country. As Kino accepted it, the car closed its door and drove off.

First of all, Kino looked for a place to get food. Spotting a restaurant nearby, Kino entered alone and found no one in there either. But the interior was spacious and kept thoroughly clean.

What came to Kino's reception was a machine comprising of a computer with an arm attached, placed on a wheelchair; it also took the orders. Kino ordered a menu that resembled spaghetti, a steak of some unknown meat, and some fruit with a never before seen color. After a while, a machine brought out the food, and so Kino ate. The money was then paid to another machine.

The price was ridiculously cheap.

Then, while exiting, a machine also came to see its customer off.

===

Looking at an information board nearby, Kino searched for a place to refuel Hermes. As ever, they saw no one. Although they did come across another vehicle on the way, when they caught up, it turned out to be an unmanned garbage truck. At a deserted gas station, Kino filled Hermes' tank. It cost next to nothing.

They then searched for a hotel. When they got to one, no one was there either.

The hotel was extravagant, kept thoroughly clean both in and out, its marble hall shining brilliantly. The machine enshrined on the front desk handled all businesses briskly. The price was also cheap here.

Kino pushed Hermes into their room. Never before had Kino ever seen a room this magnificent. Kino asked the guide machine if this was the right room, whether or not there was a mistake in rank, if it knew that its customer wasn't a king, and had it acknowledge that the price won't be paid if they were to demand a large sum of payment later, confirming the answers over and over again.

""Damn cheapskate.""

Hermes said, absent-mindedly.

Kino took a shower in the unnecessarily spacious bathroom, then got a change of underwear and shirt. Initially intending to do laundry, Kino then noticed that the hotel also had a washing service and decided to try them out. As expected, a machine came to take the clothes and said it will be done by tomorrow morning before leaving.

Kino and Hermes then took the map they had received earlier and spread it out on the carpet.

The hotel they're currently in is located in the area designated as [East Gate: Shopping District], which is the closest to the country's gate they came in from. The country was circular, and boasted a size so large that they had previously rode through only a fraction of it.

In the country's center was a circular area colored thinly in red, designated as [Center: Governmental Area]. To the south was a fairly large lake, colored in light blue. To the country's northern outskirts was an area colored in light brown, designated as [Factories and Research Institutes].

Everything else was the [Residential Area], colored in light green. It covered no less than half of the country's area.

""Hey, people do live here.""

""All these machines were created, and everything is still in perfect working order. Of course there are people here. At least it probably won't be like that place earlier, where there was only one person remaining.""

""Then, why do you think we haven't seen anyone?""

""Let's see, some plausible reasons are... Like, they can't come outside because of some religious reasons, it's a holiday, or it's their afternoon nap time. Or it might be that they just don't live around here.""

""Meaning... They're all in the residential area?""

""Probably.""

""Alright! Let's go check it out, Kino!""

Hermes' voice was raised in excitement, but Kino refused with a shake of the head,

""No, not today. If we go now, we won't get back before sunset. I don't want to ride at night, even while in town. Besides,""

""Besides?""

""I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep.""

""What? Normally you'd still be up around this time.""

While Hermes was saying that, Kino unholstered the persuaders, held them and the jacket in hand, and walked unsteadily toward the bed.

""I normally am, sure... But you see, Hermes, when I see a clean bed, I just can't help but want to lay down. That, and I'm also starting to feel sleepy...""

Saying just that, Kino draped the jacket across the bed's foot, and tucked the persuaders under the pillow. Crashing onto the fluffy comforter, Kino muttered ""Such bliss,"" and immediately fell asleep.

""Damn cheapskate.""

Hermes said, absent-mindedly.

===

The next day, Kino woke at the break of dawn.

In the room's mailbox was the laundry that had been sent off yesterday. All of them were as good as new.

Kino then started the maintenance of both hand persuaders.

The semi-automatic persuader holstered to the hip belt's backside, Kino called it 'Woodsman'. Utilizing .22 LR bullets, it was a persuader of thin silhouette. The bullets may not hold significant destructive force, but the long barrel and moderate weight gave it good aiming precision.

Kino removed the bullets from the Woodsman's magazine, fitted them into another magazine, then reloaded.

The persuader holstered to its owner's thigh, nicknamed 'Canon', was a single-action revolver. By single-action, it meant the hammer had to be cocked with each shot. Ones that are shot by just pulling the trigger were called double-action.

Canon did not use a magazine. Instead, gunpowder and bullets were loaded directly into the cylinder. Therefore, reloading it would have to involve inserting into each chamber the gunpowder, bullets, and placing percussion caps, all by hand. The percussion caps were inserted with a small amount of gunpowder; they were to be placed on the back of the cylinder and would ignite when struck by the hammer.

Kino exchanged the Canon's loaded cylinder for an empty one and practiced quick-draw, again and again.

After that, Kino took a shower.

Going to the restaurant near the lobby, a buffet-style meal had been prepared, laid out on the tables for Kino alone.

A machine prepared its frying pan, stating that it could make any kind of omelette.

Before all else, Kino made sure to confirm whether or not the meal was included in the hotel fee.

After eating as if it was a whole day's filling, Kino returned to the room and rested a while to let the food digest.

Then, when the sun had risen high, Kino knocked Hermes awake. All of the luggage were loaded onto Hermes, and they were checked out of the hotel. Following the map, they headed for the residential area.

===

The 'residential area' was more or less a forest. It was densely packed with thick trees, with several streams running through. Birdsong echoed throughout, and the moderate moisture gave a refreshing feel to the air.

Kino rode Hermes down a narrow, unpaved road.

Every so often, they would come across houses. All were of the same style: a sprawling one-story house; it was as if they had been built to be hidden in the forest. They were uniformly located at a considerable distance from their neighbors.

For a while, Kino and Hermes headed down the forest road to see if they would meet anybody. But they met no one.

Kino then parked Hermes at a spot where the houses could be seen. Abandoned houses would surely have a cold ambience to them, but that was not the case for the ones here. They felt warm and lived-in, just like houses found in any other country.

They kept watch for a while, but no signs of people were seen. As it would be rude to stay there for an extended period of time, Kino and Hermes took off.

Not finding any sign of people in the end, they got out of there and made for the center of town, designated [Center: Governmental Area].

The scene shifted from forest to buildings, the road widened and paved. As ever, they saw no one. Although they went after a moving vehicle, but once again, it turned out to be an unmanned garbage truck.

Kino and Hermes entered one of the tall buildings. They took the elevator up to the top floor, and were brought to an observation deck where one could see all in the country's circumference.

While on the observation deck, kept thoroughly clean and devoid of people, Kino and Hermes surveyed the town. They could see a thin outline of the country's wall in the distance, and greenery spreading far and wide, all according to the map.

The neighboring building also showed no signs of human life in it. Only machines of various shapes and sizes, cleaning diligently.

Kino took out a sniping scope out from the luggage. As the magnification was being adjusted, the houses in the forest were being peeked into.

""Now that's not very admirable.""

Hermes grumbled.

After a while,

""Found one. It's a person.""

Kino said, eyes still not taken off the scope.

""Really? For real?""

Hermes' voice raised.

""Yeah, one person in front of a house. An ordinary man. Exercising... There's also another person, outside a different house. A middle-aged woman. In the garden... Wonder what she's doing... Ah, she went inside. There's another house with lights on in one of the rooms.""

At this point, Kino had stopped peeking and put the scope back in the luggage.

""I told you. There are people here.""

""Hm. The houses from before gave that impression, too. But still, how come we didn't find anybody before?""

Kino sat down on the observation deck's bench, then responded to Hermes' question.

""That, I don't know. At first, I thought they just found us travelers to be unusual or scary. But...""

""But?""

""If that were true, then you'd think they'd be meeting up with fellow residents and have fun together. This town shows no signs of them being in any kind of companionship. Absolutely no one goes outside. It's like everyone is shutting themselves away in their homes.""

Kino looked out the window once more. The streets were clean and well-maintained. A residential area in the forest, fully in-tune with nature. As a country, this one was by far the best Kino had seen in terms of functionality.

""I wonder why?""

Kino murmured.

After that, Kino and Hermes headed for the [Factories and Research Institutes] area, then had a tour through a fully automated factory. The guide, who gave thorough explanations, was a machine, as expected.

Kino asked the machine why they never met anyone in this country, but it did not give an answer.

In the evening, before it got dark, Kino and Hermes returned to the hotel they had stayed at the previous night. They could have looked for a different hotel, but Kino insisted on returning all the way to the east gate, because the breakfast was delicious.

They met no one on the way.

===

The next morning, Kino ate to the point of being fully stuffed.

After filling up Hermes' tank and stocking up on portable rations, the two made their way through the town, headed west. The intention was to leave the country through its west gate.

The sound of Hermes' engine echoed through the morning forest. Kino didn't want to make too much noise in the residential area, but it simply couldn't be helped. The engine's spinning was kept as quiet as possible as they rode along.

Reaching a gentle slope in the forest, Kino cut Hermes' engine at the top, descending the hill road as it is.

Each time a house was seen, Kino would peer at it to see if there is anyone, but there was never anyone to be seen. They reached the slope's bottom after a while, and Hermes was carried slightly further by the momentum before coming to a stop.

Kino was about to start Hermes' engine up once more. It was then that a clanking sound could be heard, and so Kino looked around.

A short distance away from the road was a neat patch of grass, seemingly part of a house's garden. One man sat there, tinkering with a machine.

As his concentration was on repairing the machine, he hadn't noticed Kino and Hermes. Hermes whispered,

""Ooh. It's the first time we've seen a person here this up close.""

As if a rare animal had been discovered.

Kino pushed Hermes along and approached quietly, then called out to the man,

""Good morning.""

""Uwaah!""

The man sprang up in surprise, turning around to face Kino and Hermes. He was about thirty years of age and wore black-framed glasses. A bewildered expression appeared on his face, as if he had just seen a ghost. Then, he started speaking,

""Wh-whwhwhwhwhwhwha- Wha-""

The man spoke inarticulately.

""Are you alright? Sorry for startling you.""

Kino said.

""Whwhwhw- whwhwho-- Whehehe- Whwhewhen-""

The man's words were unintelligible. And so Hermes said,

""Kino, I think he's speaking a different language. Formally introducing himself, maybe? Sir Whhoo Whehen?""

""No, I don't think that's it...""

""Y-y-y-you two...""

As the man was somehow able to say just that, Hermes then said,

""Oh? You were right.""

""Y-y-you two don't know what I'm thinking right now?""

The man suddenly exclaimed as he pointed at Kino and Hermes.

""Huh?""

Hermes gave a blunt reply. Kino's head tilted in confusion.

The man then recovered from his panic attack so suddenly. He calmed down, his face showing an expression of tremendous happiness, way beyond what a neutral expression would be. Raising his voice, he asked again to be sure.

""You two! You don't know what I'm thinking right now?""

""No, I don't. I do understand what you are saying though.""

Kino said, calmly.

""But of course! I can't 'hear' your thoughts either! ...Ahh, wonderful! Wonderful! So you two are travelers? That's right! That must be it! H-h-h-h-how about we have some tea together! D-don't tell me you're already leaving? Please, I beg of you!""

""We can delay our departure for a bit... If you don't mind, could you please tell us why the people in this country never leave their houses?""

To the question, the man nodded eagerly, then ran up to Kino and shouted.

""Ah- Of course! I'll tell you everything!""

===

A short way down the narrow forest road was the man's house.

Kino and Hermes were led to a spacious, well-lit room. The wooden table and chairs had stylish designs. Beyond the large, curved window was a well-maintained garden in the woods. Flowers of vivid colors and several types of herb-like grasses were arranged neatly.

There was no one else in the house. Nor was there any indication of anyone else having been there.

Kino, coat removed, sat down on a chair. On the side was Hermes, stood up on the center stand.

""Here you are.""

The man placed a mug cup on the table.

""Fresh tea, planted in my very own backyard. I don't know whether it'll suit your tastes, but it's popular in this country.""

Kino took a whiff of its fragrance.

""It smells interesting. What kind of tea is it?""

""It's called the poisonplug tea.""

Hermes, hearing that, promptly shouted,

""Poisonplug!? It's not made from some poisonous flower, is it? Might wanna think twice before drinking, Kino.""

Kino, although without speaking up rudely like Hermes did, refrained from drinking. Peering into the mug, Kino then asked the man for confirmation.

""Just to be sure, is it poisonous? Will it be safe to drink if I've never had it before?""

The man chuckled, then went on,

""You two really are outsiders-- Ah, sorry for laughing. I didn't mean to mess with you. Yes, it's safe; the name is meant to signify that it blocks the poison from entering you. Ha ha ha, now that I think about it, anyone would've been weirded out if they were offered poison-something tea for the first time. Besides... how do I sa... y...""

The last word was no good. As the conversation went on, his smiling face changed not to neutral, but rather one that was on the verge of tears; in the end, he let out a cry and broke into a sob.

Kino and Hermes, clueless about what had just happened, watched over the crying man for a short while.

The man let his streaming tears fall, snorted once every few moments, then slowly spoke again.

""I wonder how many years it's been... since I last held a conversation like this... with other people... Ten years, maybe... No, perhaps even longer...""

After a short while, Kino spoke up.

""Could you tell me your story?""

The man removed his glasses, wiped his tears, and blew his nose. Then, while nodding repeatedly,

""Ah, of course, no problem. I'll tell you all about it. Why the people of this country don't meet face to face with each other.""

The man wiped off the last of his tears. He then put his glasses back on and looked at Kino in the eyes. Letting out a slow breath, he then began to speak.

""Let's see... simply put, in this country, we all perceive other people's pain. That's why we all don't meet face to face with each other... No... I meant, we can't.""

""Perceiving other people's pain?""

""What's up with that?""

The man took a sip of his tea.

""You two, have your parents ever said something along these lines to you before? To grow up to be a person that understands other people's pain. Such that you would know what others dislike, and that you wouldn't do things that would hurt them. Or, have you ever thought something like this before? That it would surely be so wonderfully convenient to know what others are thinking?""

""Yes! I have! Just when we were on the way here, when Kino was... Jeez...""

To the man's question, Hermes pounced on the opportunity to answer. It happened so fast that Kino wasn't given any chance to make a statement.

""Sorry about that, Hermes.""

Kino spoke in a disinterested tone, as if to cover up Hermes' remark.

""The people of this country believed it in earnest. Right from the olden days, it's the machines that do most of the work in this country, enabling the people to live in comfort. Food was abundant; the country, safe and affluent. Because of that, the people ended up having more free time than they could imagine, so they turned to using their brains to challenge various things. Things like discovering new formulae, going full blast on scientific pursuits, creating works of literature and music. Then on one occasion, a group physicians who were studying the human brain made a certain revolutionary discovery... They discovered that if we developed the unused portions of our brains, we would be able to communicate directly with our thoughts.""

""Directly communicating thoughts?""

Kino asked with a dubious expression. Hermes also asked,

""What's that mean?""

The man continued.

""For example, I'd think [hello] in my head. The greeting would be transmitted to people near me. It's not just the simple things though, like, when I'm sad for something, the sadness would also be immediately transmitted to people around me. Those people would comprehend my sadness, show me compassion, and together we could think up a solution. Or, as another example, a mother would be able to sense the pain and happiness of her baby, even though it can't speak. It's like telepathy, crudely speaking.""

""I see."" ""Hm~m.""

Kino and Hermes responded simultaneously.

""The people of this country praised it, calling it a wonderful discovery. With it, people would be able to mutually communicate to the bottom of each other's hearts. We would come to a deeper mutual understanding. So far, we have been communicating with an outdated method called language, one that is noisy and without any guarantee of being conveyed accurately! ...That was what we all thought. And so, to give all humans that ability, we searched for a way to easily develop our brains, eventually producing the medicine. We all took it.""

""Everyone?""

Hermes asked, without a moment's delay.

""Everyone. We all wanted to stand on the same level as all the others. We wanted to evolve. We didn't want to be left behind. And sure enough, in a sense, we have evolved...""

""What happened then?""

Kino unconsciously leaned forward. The man, making only a slight expression of sadness, started telling his story in an indifferent tone.

""From this point on, let me tell you my personal experience... I took the medicine. The next morning, when I woke up, something like [Are you getting this? Are you getting this?] jumped into my head. There was no one in the room. It was surprising, to really be getting messages from someone else while we were away from each other. Of course, it doesn't mean the words [Are you getting this?] were transmitted into my head. It felt like I was thinking [Are you getting this?] myself. Right when I thought [I got it!], the feeling [I got it too! This is amazing!] came back. Then, when I received [I'm at your door,] I hurriedly went outside, and my lover at the time was standing there. The telepathic power-granting was a success. We both were so happy, so happy indeed... we exchanged the feeling [I love you] countless times. Makes me want to laugh, thinking about it now.""

At that point, the man stopped talking for a moment and sighed.

""We thought we were the happiest people in the world... At the time, that is. We began living together, and a few days passed. Then... that one time, I saw that she was watering my herbs a little too much. And I thought. [Huh? I already warned her the other day. How many times do I have to tell her until she gets it?]. At the same time, I intended to say 'that's not it' gently. But before I could say it, she glared at me. And a reply immediately got in my head. [What!? How many times? Do you take me for an idiot!?].""

""......""

""That's right, it got transmitted to her. The things I didn't want to convey. Getting her reply so suddenly, I thought, [What's going on here? Why'd she have to get so mad for something like that?]. Then her response came, [Something like that? Something like that, huh? That thing that's a big deal to me, is it just nothing to you!?].""

This time, a faint appeared on the man's face. It was one of self-mockery.

""After that, it was nothing but telepathic fights. Truth is, she's always had an inferiority complex, believing she wasn't as smart or well-educated as I was. I'd been with her for so many years without noticing it at all... Naturally, I'd never noticed that she thought I was probably aware of it. She left behind the thought [I can't stand being together with an unfeeling, cold-blooded elitist like you!] and just went away. Left alone, I just stood there, dumbfounded. It's laughably outrageous. Precisely because we could mutually communicate straight to each other's hearts, we came to detest each other to the point of no redemption. But it was good that we ended with just that funny story... At the same time elsewhere, someone died in an accident. The person's thought while on the verge of death were transmitted to the people who rushed to help, driving them all mad. In another place, there were two politicians who'd been working together up until then, but in truth, both of them were planning on betraying the other some day; those thoughts slipped out, and a fight to the death ensued right in the congress. It ended up getting called off after they got hurt though. In schools, everyone exchanged answers with each other, making exams pointless. Ah, which reminds me, there was also someone who got a lawsuit for attempted rape and public obscenity just by approaching a young woman.""

""......""

""Well, those kinds of things probably happened all over the place. Within just a week or so, the city fell into a state of panic.""

""What happened after that?""

Kino asked. The man answered, straightforward as can be,

""It was then that we all finally realized how terrifying it is for us to know what others are thinking. Our own thoughts. The thoughts of others. Letting them all out in the open was no evolution. Well, coming to that realization could be an evolution in itself though... Or was it just plain old progression? 'If one were to know the pain of others, they will be able to show compassion toward those people. People will come to hold a deeper mutual respect for each other.' --What a big fat lie. It amounts to nothing but loss, after all, for someone to perceive pain at times when they are not the one in pain themselves. Nor does it make pain go away from the person who is the source of such feelings... There was only a single solution to this chaos. People had to isolate themselves from each other. If we were a few dozen meters apart, far enough that we couldn't hear each other's voices, the thoughts would also not reach...""

""I see... So that's why.""

Hermes spoke, seeming completely satisfied.

""Indeed. By then, everyone in this country ended up with pure, genuine anthropophobia-- and I'm not exaggerating. But after that, and as a result of all that, machines have become even more advanced, enabling us to live in this country despite everything. That's why even now, in this forest, everyone is living alone in their houses, isolated from each other. Each in our own little space, doing the things only each one of us enjoy... There have been no children born in this country for nearly ten years now. It'll probably fall to ruin soon enough. But that'll be after I die, so there's no use in worrying about it.""

The man stood up and pressed a switch on the machine behind him. Music streamed forth. An electric fiddle, playing a soothing melody.

Kino listened for a while, then said,

""It's wonderful.""

Hearing that, the man faintly smiled.

""It's always been a favorite of mine-- and so many others, ten-odd years ago. Whenever I listen to it, I would also think, 'when others hear this, would they be emotionally moved like I am?'. I used to listen to it together with my lover, too. She used to say it was good, but after everything, I was no longer sure what she truly thought of it. And now, I do wonder what you have to say, Kino... but I don't actually want to know.""

Having said that, he closed his eyes.

After a short while, the song ended.

===

""Well then, Kino. Maybe I shouldn't say this to a persuader expert, but be careful on the road.""

The man said, standing in front of the house's garage. Kino, now with hat and goggles put on, left Hermes' engine idling. Exhaust note resounded noisily.

""Not at all. I'll be careful.""

""You too, Hermes.""

""Thanks.""

""I was so happy, getting to talk to you two. I only wish I could have met you all on your first day here, but... What's past is past, I guess.""

Saying that, the man shrugged and smiled.

""Thank you for the tea. It was very good.""

Kino said and got on Hermes, leaned forward, and kicked away the stand.

Hermes was ready to take off as the gear was shifted.

But then,

""Ah! Wait! Can I have another word? Just one more thing.""

The man said, panicking. Kino stopped Hermes' engine. The surroundings fell into an abrupt silence.

The moon took another step toward Kino and Hermes, then took a deep breath.

""Ah-- um! If you don't mind, wou-- would you like to live here for a while? It's safe here, and aside from not meeting anyone, it's a very nice place to live in. You could settle down here and do whatever you like. And what about you, Hermes? You could also use the town as a base for your travels. Kino, if you're fine with it, you could live with me...""

With the man saying all that so bluntly, Kino stared at him for a while, before declining with a shake of the head.

""I'm sorry, but... I want to continue my journey.""

With Kino saying that, the man went on restlessly,

""A-- ah, that's too bad... No-- I mean-- Sorry for having said some weird stuff. No-- um-- well...""

He was all flustered. His face had gone all red.

Saying nothing, Kino started Hermes' engine and looked at the man's face.

When their eyes met as the man raised his face up, Kino smiled.

The man was surprised to see that, but before long, he also made an awkward smile.

He lightly waved his left hand.

Still smiling, Kino's head tilted lightly.

Then, facing back forward, Kino took off on Hermes.

Watching the motorrad drive away, a certain thought came up in the man's mind.

===

Shortly after exiting the country, Kino and Hermes were riding on a road amid the grassy field. The sun was already low in the sky, and soon it would be in Kino's eyes.

""Kino~ You locked eyes with that guy for a bit at the end, yeah?""

Hermes suddenly asked.

""Hm? Ah...""

""Was it loooooove?""

""Huh? Where'd that even come from?""

To Hermes' banter, Kino replied with a bitter face.

""I was thinking you'd marry him or something.""

With Hermes having a serious voice this time around, Kino laughed,

""Nah, that's not gonna happen.""

""Okay, then.""

Having said that, Hermes went silent for a while, before muttering,

""But really, someone's really gone and fallen for you... That guy has some weird tastes.""

The motorrad ran through the road in the grassy plain.

After a little while, Kino suddenly spoke up, as if recalling something.

""When he looked at me for the last time, I had a feeling that he was trying to tell me, with his thoughts-- [don't die].""

""Hm~m. And?""

""So I replied, [thank you].""

Having said that, Kino slipped out a chuckle.

""I see. But did it actually get through to him?""

As Hermes asked, Kino gave a clear answer, while still smiling,

""Who knows?"""
67,v10c1,10,1,"There was one country in a rather wide valley of a steep mountainous region.
Its walls were made from stone cut out from the neighboring mountains. Its houses and roads were also made of this stone. These were historic ruins made by some people in ancient times, but later made into a country either by their descendants or by someone else.
Horse-drawn carriages were leisurely coming back and forth the roads, and huge cows pulled plows over the farms. It was a quiet and peaceful country — at least it was supposed to be.
Since olden times, this country elected a person to become its religious and spiritual leader.
This person was called an ‘Elder’.
The Elder was chosen from the common people through an impartial lottery. Afterwards, he would be trained and entrusted with important duties. He would abide by strict laws, serve as an example to the whole country, and work for the sake of all the people.
The current Elder was a man just over fifty years of age. He was chosen shortly before the previous Elder passed away, and carried out his duties excellently for the past twenty years. He had the support and respect of the citizens.
However, this Elder suddenly vanished about half a year ago. Everyone searched for him all over the country, but he cannot be found anywhere. No one had any idea how he managed to disappear from the country.
After a while, a message came from people who called themselves ‘valley bandits’: ‘We abducted your Elder, and we will kill him immediately if you refuse to pay us ransom.' Everyone was surprised.
The Elder after all is an important person, so everyone did as the bandits wished, and presented gold and silver treasures, food, and clothes.
Even so, the bandits did not release the Elder, and demanded more things again and again in exchange for his safety.
The people of the country became more and more distressed.


During this time, a traveler came to the rarely traversed country.
The lone traveler who came riding a battered car was an elegantly-dressed, youthful woman. Inside the holster on her right hip is a high-caliber hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol).
For some reason, she looked strong.
The leaders of the country gathered. Since they had nothing to lose, they decided to give it a try and explained the situation to the traveler. They asked her if she could take on the job of exterminating the bandits.
The woman asked them to tell her the details about the bandits’ hideout. Everybody replied that it was located at the top of the valley. It was not possible to approach it from below, nor was it within the aiming range of a rifle from the opposite side of the valley.
The woman pondered for a while, and then asked,
“How much will be my reward?”


There was a valley.
The valley formed by the steep and craggy mountains was several hundred meters deep. The river flowing at its bottom looked very thin from above, but the valley itself was two kilometers in width.
There was only one road that leads up to the bends and curves of the valley. A car could barely fit in this road.
Beside this road, at a considerably high part of the valley, several huts were built. There was a big hut and a number of smaller ones. This was the bandits’ hideout.
It was morning in the valley.
A few strips of clouds were floating on the pale blue morning glow of the sky. It was a lovely early summer morning, with the flowers of highland plants damp with the previous night’s dew.
Three guards holding rifle-type persuaders were standing in front of the hideout, while thin smoke from cooking drifted from inside the huts.
A bandit holding a steaming cup came out from a hut. He approached the male guard, and handed him the cup of warm tea.
The guard thanked him. The moment he took the cup, a light shined on the two of them.
The dazzling sun appeared from the lined up mountain peaks behind the opposite side of the valley. The hideout and the valley brightened up in an instant.
The male guard narrowed his eyes, and slightly raised the cup in greeting to the morning sun.
“To a brand new day,” the man said. And then, the man’s body was halved.
His torso exploded and fell sideways to the ground as his internal organs and blood scattered. The tea spilled.
Still confused with what just occurred, the other man’s chest exploded as both his arms and neck fell to the ground.
One second later, the long, low echoes of the two shots rang in the valley.
Another surprised guard soon lost his body. The other one shouted.
“E-enemy raid!”
Those were his last words.
Two men who leaped out of the hut briskly were blown up at the same time.
Someone crouched and yelled as he heard the long and low thunderous echo of the shots.
“A sniper! We are being targeted!”
Bullets rained down on a guard hut at one end of the road. The hut shook as chips of wood were loudly blown off from it, and eventually it crumbled down. All of the people sleeping inside were crushed underneath.
Another small hut was destroyed, its logs clattering and falling off. Several people crouching down in front of it were trundled along to the bottom of the valley.
Bandits holding rifles in their hands came out of the big hut and took cover behind a rock, but were driven into chaos as they did not know where the shots were coming from.
This time the bullets flew towards this rock, reducing it to dust in three shots and blowing the three men hiding behind it to bits.


The woman was at the top of the opposite side of the valley.
She was sitting on the ground with her back to the sun and with her legs in front of her. Before her was a thick metallic tripod supporting a persuader the length of one person.
This persuader was originally mounted on top of tanks, meant to shoot down tough targets such as trucks and armored vehicles. Normally, it was not used to shoot down bare humans.
One would ask, ‘Is this actually an astronomical telescope?’ upon seeing the large and thick scope attached on top of the persuader.
The woman peeked through this scope, seeing clearly the bandits moving about in confusion at the other side of the valley.
The woman grasped two rods at the end of the persuader with both of her hands. She aimed with care, and pressed the firing lever by her thumb just once.
Boom-!
A tremendous sound was heard as one bullet was fired off. The persuader shook from the recoil. The barrel spouted great quantities of gas, blurring the air. If it were not for the water carefully sprinkled on the ground beforehand, the air would have been filled with a great amount of dust. An enormous empty cartridge as big as a flower vase fell to the ground.
A rifle cannot be compared with the massive bullet that tore through the air, glided across the valley and halved a man’s body.
Then, through the eyes of the woman across the scope, the image of a middle-aged man being dragged by the bandits was reflected.


“Can’t you see this?! If you continue this any further, we will kill this man!”
Because their voice can’t possibly reach the other side of the valley, the bandits acted out their message. They made the Elder squat on the ground, poked his head with an automatic hand persuader, and then glowered towards the direction where the shots originated. They could see nothing but the glare of the sun, stunning their eyes.
The Elder’s heavily bearded face registered complete confusion. He only remained squat on his knees with both of his hands raised up.
“We will really shoot!”
The bandit made a number of shooting gestures, poking the Elder's head with the persuader.
The woman could see this scene clearly, but as if to say that it has nothing to do with her, she continued to fire.
Behind the woman, each thunderous shot startled the tethered cow that pulled the heavy equipment up to that place.
“Don’t you get it?! We said we’re going to shoot!”
The bandit yelled as he poked the Elder with his persuader, but the shots kept on coming. A number of people came out of the large hut and died one after another in their confusion. Even the humans hiding inside the huts were not spared as the huts were shot down.
“Oh no...”
Everything else that was moving except for himself and the Elder were killed. And then one final shot made its way towards the dumbfounded bandit.


The Elder, kneeling and with his hands upraised, slowly looked on both sides. The place which was earlier a bandit hideout became a bandit morgue. It looked like the remnants of a ripe tomato throwing festival.
A long time has passed since the last gunshot was heard. The Elder slowly tried to stand up. Then a roar came up as a bullet flew and crushed a rock behind him. The Elder was surprised and sat down again, trembling.
A long time passed.
The Elder slowly tried to lie on his side. This time, the bullet flew to the other side, splitting in half a log which belonged to one of the huts.
“It’s a warning for you not to move. For the time being, it’s best for you to stay as you are.”
The Elder obeyed.


The sun rose higher, and the scattered blood on the rocks started to dry up.
As the Elder sat fixedly in the same place, with his face covered in sweat, the sound of a horse’s stride climbing the valley reached his ears. As it came closer, the Elder realized that it was really a horse.
A woman with long black hair alighted from the horse and pulled out a large revolver from the holster on her right thigh.
The woman looked around her for a while, and approached the Elder. She spoke to him.
“You’re the Elder, I suppose? I was hired by your country.”
The Elder looked up at the woman for a while, and his bearded mouth opened and closed.
“I, I was saved...,"" he managed to say. He nodded several times in response to the woman’s questions.
“As I thought. Elder, there are things I would like to ask, but before that...”
The woman pointed her revolver at a blood-soaked bandit —— a slightly short, handsome young man —— lying about two meters behind the Elder.
“You there, get up,"" the woman said, and the man opened his eyes wide. He got up, showed that he was not holding anything, and then slowly wiped off the sweat from his face. Then, he raised both of his arms.
“You got me. And here I thought I wouldn’t be exposed...”
“What are you saying? You hid behind the Elder right from the very start,” the woman said.
“Elder, can you stand?” the woman asked. The Elder stood up, and then he picked up the right arm holding the hand persuader which was used to poke his head earlier. He removed the arm...
“T-this bandit! H-how dare you!”
...and aimed it towards the man whose hands were upraised.
“We need at least one person alive as witness. I know how you feel but, please don’t kill him,” the woman said, returning her own revolver in its holster. The Elder did not shoot and lowered his hand. The man just lightly shrugged his shoulders.
“What did everyone in the country tell you about me?” the Elder asked the woman.
The woman answered, “Everyone was very worried about you.”
“Is that so...,” the Elder muttered. Then he suddenly pointed the persuader he was holding towards the woman. The man with his hands up shrugged once more.
“Those guys were worried? About me? ——Rubbish! Woman! Hands in the air!” the Elder said, his bearded face filled with anger.
“What do you mean? How is that related to you aiming that persuader at me?” The woman asked calmly while raising her hands slightly above her shoulders.
“A big deal! Their intention is for you to take me back and make me work for them again! Because I’m the Elder! ——What’s an elder for?! Give me a break! They just choose some random person and destroy his peaceful life! I’m not free to see my family! I can’t even be with my parents at the moment of their death! It’s not me they want! It’s an 'elder’! I refuse to go back to that prison!” The Elder blabbered in one breath. Then he dropped his tone, and coldly,
“That’s why I’m going to kill you and run off somewhere. I was just getting tired of living together with these stupid bandits. I’ll travel somewhere, and start my life over. I have money, as well as a horse.”
“‘Stupid’ is quite a nasty thing to say. Everyone was only following your suggestion, after all.”
“Sorry about that, brother. I am much obliged to you. ——By any chance, do you want to come with me? You can be my subordinate.”
“I’ll reject that offer.”
“Then, I’ll kill you next after this woman,” he grinned.
The man, with his hands still upraised, spoke to the woman whose hands were also in the air.
“Hey, lady with the revolver, what do you think of this man?”
“Uhm, I have various thoughts but——. Now isn’t the right time.”
“Well, that’s true.”
The two looked at the man, and then the woman spoke.
“Elder, there’s one thing I would like to ask you.”
The Elder grinned. “What is it, woman? Begging for your life?”
“Nope. ——How did you get out of that ‘prison’ without anyone noticing? Everyone in the country finds it a complete mystery.”
“Oh, that?” The Elder looked extremely pleased.
“That is very simple. I studied some archaeology as a hobby when I was a student and made a bit of research on the country’s structure. I learned from an old man that long ago, the sewers were used by kings as an emergency escape route. No one knows about this anymore, and I used it to escape. As luck will have it, I met these stupid bandits, and everything worked out as planned.”
“I see. So it was like that,” the woman nodded. The man also congratulated him.
“What a wonderful escape route. Afterwards, it would be best to close it down.”
“That’s right. You’re finally saying some sense,” the Elder said and snickered. He pointed the persuader at the woman.
“Now then, you’ll have to die. So where should I first shoot at? Your arms? Your legs? Where would be good? Hmm? What do you think?”
The man looked at the exceedingly amused face of the Elder, shook his head a little with an exasperated expression as if to say that he’s hopeless.
“Your legs it is!” The Elder spat, aimed at the woman’s legs, and pulled the trigger.
Clink.
The clear sound echoed that morning through the valley.
“Eh?”
The Elder pulled once more, and there was another clink.
“Huh?”
“Elder, that thing is not yet loaded y’know. Isn’t there a red mark beside the ejection hole? It won’t fire. Well——,” the man said.
The woman leisurely and slowly pulled out the revolver from her waist, aimed at the Elder who was hastily trying to load his persuader, and fired.
“——It’s already too late.”


“Elder, the truth is...” the woman spoke, facing the Elder who fell on his back.
“I received three requests. First, to exterminate the bandits. Second, to discover the trick to your escape. And third, to return to the country and report that you have already been ‘killed’. You were already abandoned by that country’s leaders. However, the citizens were hoping for your safety so they can’t let you die without doing anything to help you. I am to report that you were killed by the bandits, regardless of whether you were really alive or not. It seems that they are going to elect a new elder, tomorrow even. It’s by lottery again.”
“......”
“And so, you’re free to do as you wish as long as you don’t go back to that country. You can go wherever you want. ——They wanted me to tell you that.”
“......”
“Isn’t that great! Your heart’s desire was granted at last!” the man said happily, in place of the Elder. The Elder was still lying on his back, both eyes still looking at the sky, his pupils still dilated wide.
Blood was flowing out of his mouth.


“Now then,” the woman said, facing the man as she returned the revolver in its holster.
The man was already on his feet, wiping the dried blood of another person from his body with a disgusted expression.
“You weren’t a bandit to begin with, right?” the woman said matter-of-factly.
The man scrubbed his bloody hands on his trousers, and then looked at the woman with his handsome face.
“Ah..., I’m beat. How did you know? Will you tell me the reason? Could it be, ‘His moves are too good for a bandit,’ or maybe, ‘His assessment of a crucial situation is topnotch’?”
“About half a year ago, I dropped by a country and saw your wanted poster. ——If I had found you a bit closer to that country, I would have gladly taken your head back with me.”
“...Oh, I see.”
“My job is to exterminate the bandits. You’re free to go anywhere you like.”
“I shall take up those kind words. This shall be the end of my easy life pretending as a bandit. Well then.”
The man turned his back, but then the woman called out to him.
“However, tell me the location of the treasures you extorted from that country. I’m going to take all of it.”
As he heard this, the man looked up to the heavens with an unpleasant expression. He wheeled around, and appealed to the woman with a calm expression.
“Can I take at least half? It’s just right since I worked for it, you know.”
“All of it.”
“How’s forty percent? I have the right to at least that much.”
“All of it.”
“How about thirty-five? Isn’t that appropriate enough?”
“All of it.”
“It’s painful for me, but I’m willing to accept thirty percent.”
“All of it.”
“Say, twenty percent is my limit——”
“All of it.”
“I can help you carry it, so——”
“Then please carry all of it.”
“Today’s weather is great, isn’t it?”
“Yeah”
“....... How much——”
“All of it.”
“......”
And then the man closed his eyes and crossed his arms. He thought for a while.
“Uhmm, this is quite an abrupt question but...”
“What is it?”
“Have you ever been called a ‘demon’?”


A car was running along a mountain road.
It was a small car in a fairly bad condition, and cannot even be flattered with cleanliness.
The car was running leisurely on the bad road overlooking the bandits’ hideout from afar. In just a while, the sky will be indicating twilight.
The woman who was driving the car saw a man on the supposedly abandoned mountain road.
He was a slightly short, but handsome young man. He was standing beside the road, carrying a simple bag and a rifle on his back. He was facing the car, extending his right arm horizontally with his thumb up.
The car stopped in front of the man. The man approached the car and talked to the woman in the driver’s seat.
“Excuse me, but can I hitch a ride up to a particular place? I can’t possibly walk the distance. I have no money, but I am confident of my skills. Well, I’m no match against a certain someone though.”
The man displayed the hand persuader suspended on his left hip. It was a .22 caliber automatic type with a square barrel.
“I’ve treasured it since I was a kid. This is the only thing I can’t let go of. ——Ah, yes, I can carry your luggage.”
“I don’t need a partner,” she said bluntly and started the car’s gears. The man yelled as he chased after the running car.
“Also! I can fix your persuader! The barrel and the cylinder are already worn out! Its performance has dropped, hasn’t it?”
After running for twenty meters, the car stopped. The man caught up with it, and the woman stepped down from the driver’s seat.
“Can you drive?”
“Of course, I can!”
The man tossed his luggage at the back, and sat in the driver’s seat with high spirits.
He waited for the woman to sit on his side, and then set off.














"
68,v10c2,10,2,"“It’s so hot—, Kino,” said a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly).
Two boxes were attached on both sides of its rear wheel, and loaded on top of it was a big bag, a sleeping bag and fuel cans. It was parked on its stand.
“It’s hot,” was the short answer of the motorrad’s driver called Kino.
She was a young person, with short black hair and big eyes. She was wearing a black vest over a white shirt, with a belt loosely fastened around her waist. A hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) holster was attached on her right thigh.
A number of low, smooth mountains were lined up, the grounds of which were covered with forests. The motorrad was parked on the lone forest road. The reddish earth of the road was surrounded left and right with trees, obstructing the view.
Kino was sitting beside the road, under the shadow made by a thick tree.
The forest was filled with warm air, the human being tormented with the unforgiving hot and humid air. Only the tops of the tall trees were privileged with the blowing wind, fluttering comfortably. Hundreds of crickets from near and far the forest were making tremendous noise in all ways possible.
Kino took a sip from the water flask in her hand.
“And, lukewarm too.”
“I know right?”
Even while sitting and not doing anything, sweat was trickling down Kino’s cheek. She looked up; not a single cloud can be seen in the sky, only the intense summer glare. She looked down; the lights and shadows were in stark contrast with each other on the road. An ant walked by.
“It would be nice if air-conditioning technology existed in the next country.... I want to sleep for at least three days,” Kino murmured.
“What if the next country does not even have a shower, or an electric fan, let alone air-conditioning?”
“I don’t want to think about it,” Kino said, and stood up. She dusted off her bottom, put away the water flask in the box, and wore the hat she was using as a fan earlier.
“Let’s go, Hermes. We should be arriving soon.”
The motorrad called Hermes gave his consent.
Kino sat on the motorrad and started the engine. The engine made a loud noise, and at the same time, the crickets on a nearby tree cried noisily, as if competing with it.
The noisy sounds reverberated through the humid forest.


“At long last,” Kino said as she quickly stopped on the forest road. On one side of the steep slope, there were no trees and there was an open view.
From a distance, they can see a green ragged land and silver-colored walls. The walls stretched up and down along the delicate mountain ridges.
""You may be able to swim,” said Hermes. On the left side of the walls, in the south, they can barely see something blue which was not the sky.


The road proceeded consistently and descended into a valley. And finally, it reached the walls.
“This is amazing,” said Hermes. Kino stopped, and looked up at the big wall.
The height of the walls from the bottom of the valley was tremendous. It filled the gap in the valley like a dam, exceeding the height of the mountains on its either side. It stood level with the walls towering above the mountains. Kino and Hermes were in its shadows.
The wall surface was smooth and of a dull silver color. Here and there were traces of lined up plates of the same material. Hermes wondered aloud.
“Is it stone? It doesn’t seem to be metal.”
“It looks hard.”
And on the road ahead, a gate made of similar material was tightly shut. They soon realized that there was nothing short of a guardroom　by the gates. There was nobody nearby. There were no houses around.
Eventually, in the middle of the cricket sounds, Kino dismounted from Hermes and approached the gate. And,
“There’s a button-like thing here, placed where a person can reach it.”
“Maybe you should push it.”
Kino pushed.
Ding-dong.
A flat electronic sound rang out of thin air.
Kino took her hat off and wiped the sweat from her forehead.
‘Ye-s? Oh, a traveler, is it? We will open it shortly, please go ahead and enter.’
And then, the gate slowly and quietly slid upwards.
“There’s no screening? How careless,” Hermes said. Kino also found it strange,
“......”
And soon understood when the gate was fully opened.
Beyond the gate, a bit further away, was another gate.


After passing through the second wall in the same manner,
“......”
There was a third one. The gate in front did not open until the gate behind them was completely closed.
The area between the two walls was not exposed to the sun, and is dark, but the air was stale and humid. Kino looked up and saw a slice of the sky.
Through the same thin gap, she could see both sides of the mountain; the trees had been cut off. On the high, grassy slope, a number of big rectangular box-like objects were stacked.
“I see. In times of emergency, they drop and blow up those things to block the gate and the road,” said Hermes.
After passing through the third gate, there was a fourth one, and they saw a building which seemed embedded to the wall.
The immigration inspector was waiting in front of the building to guide Kino inside. She passed through the door and entered.
“......”
The moment she entered, the guide saw Kino took a big breath upon quietly coming indoors.
“Oh, is it too cold?” the inspector asked.


Without much screening, Kino and Hermes received an entry permit.
Kino and Hermes were welcomed and informed that they were the first ones to come for more than half a year, as travelers do not visit often.
“By the way, did you come here to watch the fireworks display, Miss Kino and Mr. Hermes?” One of the examiners, a middle-aged woman, asked.
Kino shook her head, and the examiners were slightly surprised.
“That is very fortunate. Tomorrow night, our annual summer fireworks display will be held at the beach by the south. Please have a look at it. It’s very pretty,” the lady examiner said.


Past the walls, the road was once again running through the forest valley. This time it was a highway. The road was wide and paved perfectly and there were streetlights.
Kino spread out the map she got.
The country was comprised of mountains for the most part, and there was a gulf into the southern side. It was enclosed with walls, though its marks were as small as the letters on the last line of an eye chart.
In the middle of the coastal area was a long crescent-shaped beach, from the center of which a boulevard extended due north. Only this part had flat lands, and both sides of the street were dense with residential areas. At the north end of the street, drawn against the mountainous backdrop were buildings and sites probably reserved for government facilities.
“We’re here right now.” Kino pointed at the gate on the easternmost point. There was still some distance away to the center of the country.


Kino and Hermes rode to the west. The road was sewn on the mountain’s surface, continuing through repeated curves. The paved road was wide and there were guardrails.
“So easy,” said Hermes.
Kino and Hermes rode on the pavement reflecting the intense sunlight. Before long, they saw an enormous graveyard on the mountainside to the right. The gravestones were lined up neatly on the slopes like terraced fields.
Further ahead, the valley gradually opened up. The number of houses increased bit by bit, as well as the number of cars coming and going. The cars were all the same except for the color, as they were all rustic four-wheel-drive vehicles.
“Hmm? Kino, this country only has those kinds?”
“I don’t know. Maybe they’re in fashion?”
After exiting the valley, they arrived into the flat area which was the country’s center. In addition, the number of buildings and people suddenly increased, and both sides of the road were almost filled.
They rode through the boulevard towards the center. On one side, a certain number of streets through the boulevard extend to the south, towards the sea. The number of cars on the road increased as nightfall approached. There was a high road at the center of the boulevard, planted with trees. The sidewalk served as a resting place and people holding umbrellas walked by.
Upon turning to the right, they stopped at the intersection. A big armored vehicle suddenly came out from a street and made a turn right in front of Kino and Hermes. The enormous armored vehicle had an angular body, with eight wheels, each one the size of a child. However, it was unarmed and clad in a fancy orange color.
Upon turning, the armored vehicle immediately stopped by the sidewalk. The steel door at the back opened and a normal looking person got off. Then, the sweaty people on the sidewalk went aboard. When everybody was inside, the door closed, the signal went off, and it rode off once more.
“Kino, was that supposed to be a bus?”
“Probably. Maybe it’s in fashion.”
At the back of the street was a three-storey building, the hotel the inspector told Kino about.
Kino and Hermes passed through the entrance. The air-conditioning was working perfectly. The difference in temperatures was so immense that the outside world shut out by the two-door entrance seemed like a totally different world.
The manager welcomed and guided them to their room. It was not spacious, but it was not cramped either.
“It’s cool and refreshing,” Kino said while falling on her back to the bed, looking at the ceiling.
“Ok, ok. Don’t sleep just yet, unload the luggage first. There are things you have to do first, right?” Hermes scolded.
“Yeah...”
Kino got up abruptly and unloaded the luggage from Hermes.
She took out a pouch from inside the bag. Inside was a dirty shirt among other items.
“Cleanliness first. Are you planning to mix in with the crowd wearing a sweaty, stinky shirt?”
“*Sigh*...”
Afterwards, Kino asked if she could borrow a washing machine. She was encouraged to pay for a cleaning service, but she refused and took the machine instead.
It was already evening when all the dirty clothes were finished drying on a stretched rope inside the room.
“Good job.”
“I’m so tired.”
And then Kino ate her supper, took a shower, and immediately went to bed.


The next day.
Kino woke up at the crack of dawn.
She maintained all of her persuaders, practiced her quick draw exercises without making much noise, and took another shower.
She then folded and returned the completely dried clothes to the bag.
During breakfast, there were small explosive ponpon sounds heard from outside. She was told that those were signals indicating that the fireworks display will push through, since the weather remained as is.
After tapping Hermes awake, Kino went out sightseeing.
The weather was sunny. Several cotton-candy-like clouds were floating, and the intense and dazzling sunlight shined down since morning. The temperature was high, showing no signs of getting lower.
Kino and Hermes were advised to visit the government facilities at the end of the boulevard. Only a few people on holiday can be seen. Formerly religious structures, the buildings were characteristically made of wood. On the north side was a dense forest, spread to the back of which was a park and a pond. There was a stage, with a roof explaining that it was once a ‘Historic Dance Hall’.
There were long stairs along the slope, and Kino alighted from Hermes to climb it. She looked back at the scenery and saw the straight road up against the beach and the sea. The blue of the sky reflected by the sea was dark and in stark contrast with the blue of the water near the coast; it was as if there were two types of water. The horizon ran on the space between the green capes on both sides. On the cape was the tip of the walls running along the mountain ridge. Over there, a high lighthouse was built.
Kino went down the stairs, and saw that Hermes became a roost for a large number of doves in the park.
“Ah—, Kino? I don't mind if you shoot and eat these birds,” the white mass which was Hermes spoke.


“It’s still so hot.”
“What if you swim?”
Kino and Hermes went south the boulevard, and came out to the coast.
The road ran along the expanse of the beautiful, arched beach. The sandy coast was lined up with simple houses which had become restaurants and inns.
The beach was full of people taking a dip. Kino and Hermes stopped beside the road.
“......”
And looked at the scenery before them.
“Just what you need. Do you have a bathing suit?” Hermes said.
There were naked bathers, who seemed enjoying themselves while swimming.
After having lunch back in the hotel, 
“I’ll prepare for sitting-up late.”
Kino maxed out the air-conditioner and then crawled to bed underneath several layers of blankets and comforters.
“This is the life...”
“Destined to poverty.”
“Wake me up on time.”
“Ok, ok.”


It was soon past noon.
Kino woke up naturally, and headed to the coast with Hermes. They rode through the boulevard and arrived at the sandy beach.
Slowly, people began to gather. Many of the stalls by the roadside were open, and colorful mats were laid out on top of the sand.
Kino gave up on the beach and parked Hermes on his center stand by the sidewalk. She sat down beside the guardrails.
As she sat down, Kino looked at the increasing number of people and waited.
As the sun slowly approached the mountains, the western sky brightened into a reddish-orange color. The huge fireball sank to the other side of the walls. The lights of the stores opened.
A number of vessels and ships were floating off the bay’s shore. Medium-sized ships with silver hulls were lined up, and large sheets were covering something bulging on the decks. Many vehicles were parked on both sides of the bay, as well as on the mountainside. As expected, there were also bulges covered by large sheets.
“They will probably be launching the fireworks from the ships and from over there.”
“I see. Kino, have you seen fireworks before?”
“It’s the first time I’ll see see something this large-scale.”
As more people gathered on the beach, the congestion on the road became less. Kino let Hermes wait for a while, and soon brought back a paper bucket the size of a flowerpot.
“What’s that?”
“It’s being sold in the stalls over there. It’s a dessert of finely crushed ice with sweet syrup and sugar-boiled beans on top. It may be risky, but it’s worth trying. It’s cold and yummy.”
Upon saying this, Kino put a big spoon of ice in her mouth.
“Ice? You better not ruin your tummy,” said Hermes.
The sun was setting. The afterglow was sucked into the western sky and vanished. The blue color began to appear under the sky, and a weak wind began to blow from the right side of the beach. The remaining heat in the road dissipated from below.
When Kino has eaten much,
“Uh,” she said with a frown.
“What’s the matter?”
“I discovered something about this.”
“What?”
“When I eat a lot of it at once, my head hurts...”
“Hah! I told you.”


In the thin darkness, small explosive ponpopon sounds were heard, and three white billows of smoke drifted into the air.
‘E-hem, good evening everyone. The weather is good, and there are no evening showers to worry about——’ A laid-back announcement began.
‘——Uhm—, well then, let’s begin the fireworks display.’
There was a round of applause. People wearing work clothes on top of the launch pads on top and on both sides of the ships removed the neatly tuckered sheets which were for protection from the rain.
Suddenly, the ships were set alight.
From the ships lined side-by-side, bright red grains of light bubbled up into the air. Hundreds of thousands of grains made up a red fountain in the dark sky. The sound of intermittent explosions, akin to clothes being torn apart, echoed through the beach one beat later.
Along with the audience’s applause, the grains of light continuously soared in the sky, drawing a high parabola across the sky to the other side of the sea.
Soon, the red fountain born from the ships flickered out. The column of light extended straight and sprinkled on both sides. It was like a curtain swaying in the wind.
After the lights stopped and the last grains have flown up, the lights gushed vibrantly once again. A ray of light came running across the deep purple sky in a rhythm. These also came from the ships, the slightly blurred silhouettes of which were enveloped with an intense yellow light, and was reflected in the sea for some time.
At the same time as the light from below disappeared, red streaks of light extended from the launch pads on both sides. The extremely fast grains of light flowed, intersected in the middle of the air, and drifted to the other side of the mountain.
“As expected, a large-scale fireworks display is really different,” Kino said.
“No, I think this is different from normal,” Hermes said reservedly.
“You think so?” Kino said while looking at the streaks of light running in the sky.
“Normally, you don’t use something like those in a fireworks display,” Hermes said while looking at the object on top of the ship —— a rotating, six-barreled .20mm Gatling gun firing a hundred rounds per second.
“But it’s so pretty,” Kino said while the dazzling lights were reflected from her eyes. Once again, grains of light spewed forth from below and from both sides, and intersected at a single point. A huge triangle was drawn.
And then, after consuming several ten thousand rounds, it suddenly stopped.


While smoke floated on the sky,
‘Please wait until we’re finished with the preparations for the next fireworks,' the announcement resounded through the beach.
Kino carried a mouthful of ice to her mouth.
The ships which fired the column of fireworks a while ago moved out of the way, and soon the bay was empty.
'Uhm—, thank you for waiting. You will witness the traditional annual underwater fireworks in a moment.'
A single ship began to cross the bay at a high speed from left to right. Round lumps were continuously rolling and falling off from its stern.
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.
There were big explosions in the water. A column of seawater went up with a deep orange pillar of flame in its center. The water and flame structure stayed above the sea for just a moment. Another pillar went up almost at the same time as the one before it collapsed. The evenly spaced vibrations of the explosions reached beyond the beach towards the road.
The pillars ran across the bay as if chasing the ship, which was now running from right to left. It traveled back and forth across the bay.
“Those were fuel-filled depth charges. [1] What a waste.” Hermes’ mutterings were erased by the crowd’s applause.


They waited until the smoke settled again,
‘Uhm—, then, for this year’s featured fireworks, please look to your left.’ The tension-free narration said once more.
From the dark and barely visible launch pad on the left, a long and narrow flame spouted for a moment. A smokeless flame erupted towards the sky from the tail of a large cylinder. At the same time, a small smoke began to billow from the side as the cylinder started to rotate. Square boxes were closely packed like fish scales on the cylindrical body.
It went across right in front of the audience for a moment.
Bright little fireballs were released into the air in quick succession from the boxes as the cylinder rotated. The fireballs were shot from the tip to the back of the accelerating cylinder in perfect timing.
In an instant, a spiral was drawn high in the sky.
The long and enormous spiral of light spread out into full view. It stretched into the sky like a round corridor. The pupils of the audience dilated, the little openings became darker than the sky. The expecting crowd raised a cheer louder than before.
The spiral of light collapsed, but the light continued to shine, and fell from the midsummer sky like snow. The number of falling particles was doubled by the calm sea which reflected the lights like a black mirror.
Soon the snow of the sky and the sea approached each other, touched the water, and together disappeared for eternity. The beach grew quiet as the last of the particles disappeared.
The surface-to-surface missiles [2] carrying a flare dispenser [3], have flown far, far away, never to come back.


The fireworks display continued. The intense light slowly came down while flickering and shaking in the air. In addition, hundreds of white flashes burned back. Red streaks of light came running, weaving through the shaking sky. From left and right, flares attached on parachutes, cannon shells, and rounds from Gatling guns fired on timed programming.
The sky was so bright that the beach looked as if it was daytime. Suddenly Kino looked to the left and to the right.
On the road were people watching the fireworks — families with their children, lovers, groups of friends; the memories of the day left on their happy, illuminated faces.
“......”
Kino half-rose from the guardrail, took three steps towards Hermes, and suddenly sat down on the carrier.
“What?” Hermes asked, the light being reflected from his tank.
“Ice. Do you want some?” Kino offered the bucket to Hermes.
“I'll pass, but thanks for the offer.""
“You’re welcome.”
While sitting on Hermes and watching the wild dance of light particles, Kino slid down the last of the almost melted ice down her throat.


The wind coming from the sea blew stronger, and the chilly air began to be felt.
The crazily shining sky suddenly became quiet. Several gunshots discreetly resounded, signaling the end of the fireworks display.
People began to go home, some by foot, and some via the armored vehicle buses.
While observing the people rising from the beach, talking with smiles on their faces, and passing in front, and while listening to the sound of the sea breeze, Kino and Hermes waited for the road to get less congested.
Kino had a cup of tea in the lobby upon returning to the hotel. When the manager asked her of her impression of the fireworks display, Kino answered that it was very beautiful.
“It was very beautiful, but don’t you think using that much weapon and ammunition was very wasteful?” Hermes asked. The middle-aged manager with receding hairline was slightly surprised.
“Eh, did you not hear the reason for it?”
“No.” “Not at all.”
“Oh, then let me explain. Those were ‘gifts’,"" the manager said as he sat in front of Kino.
""Those were not manufactured in our country. You saw the ship didn’t you? Unmanned ships with containers on board come to the beach once a month. They always contain a variety of military weapons.”
“Were those literally gifts?” “Where did it come from?”
“We have no idea at all who sent them, and for what reason. It seems that it suddenly came more than a hundred years ago, when this country was still small. And since nobody came to take them back, well, we were just grateful and assumed that they were gifts from heaven. Eventually, we got used to receiving them.""
“I get it. Those four-wheel drives and armored vehicles were ‘gifts’ too, right?”
“That’s right. Thanks to those, transportation became a breeze, and we were able to expand the country. The ships became handy in catching fish. We disassembled the containers and used them as material for buildings and walls. However, there was one problem.”
“What is it?”
""Surplus. The number of items we received was just too much. Everyone wished to have a vehicle because it was so easy to obtain them, but as a result, the roads were always congested. Also, we were building a fourth wall before we knew it. We couldn’t do anything about the increasing surplus, and the containers became a nuisance had to be thrown away in that mountain.”
“Eh? Those weren’t traps for defense?” Hermes asked, surprised, and the manager shook his head.
“Definitely not. There’s no need for such measures. Up to now, this country has never been attacked, not even once. To begin with, this country doesn’t even have an army. It’s because there’s not a single country close by.”
“That’s why there was also an excess of weapons,” said Kino.
“That’s right. Whether it be missiles, or machine guns, or bombs; a lot of these ridiculous things were included. For a while, we discarded them to the mountain in the country’s outskirts along with the other trash, but there was a time when a lightning bolt caused a big explosion, and there was an outrageous uproar. We had no choice but to consume them all by firing them off to the sea, but that time, we were flooded with complaints about the noise.”
“So the fireworks display was—,” Hermes said.
“Exactly. We changed our way of thinking. One year, a lot of people gathered to watch the weapons being violently consumed. We solved our problem, killing two birds with one stone. Now, we have a festival to represent this country, something that everybody can look forward to. It becomes flashier year after year. Even now, I’m looking forward for next year’s display.”


The next morning. In other words, the third morning since Kino entered the country.
Kino left from the western wall. Once again, she went through the forest road.
She was soon a long way off from the country, between the green forest and the blue sky, in the middle of climbing a steep slope.
“Ah, someone’s there,” Hermes said. Kino released the accelerator.
They were on the mountain’s summit. There was no visibility among the trees. Over there were people in green.
They were wearing green camouflage uniforms, green hats, and their faces and hands were painted green. They were carrying out luggage from the forest to a small four-wheel-drive vehicle on the side of the road.
“Oh, hi there,” one person said, surprised upon seeing Kino and Hermes.
Kino returned the greeting and cut off Hermes’ engine.
“Are you a traveler? You must have been to that country,” one of the men said. They were resting their hands, sitting on packing boxes placed under the shadows.
“Then, you must have seen it last night?”
Kino nodded. The man continued.
“Our group came from a country in the north to monitor that. Because it is being held on the same day every year.”
“Monitor?” “It’s not a ‘field trip’, is it?” Kino and Hermes asked. The man shook his head.
“It’s for surveillance. Our mission, that is, the military's, is to observe neighboring countries’ movements. ——That country was the most frightening and the most alarming we’ve seen. Year after year, it spends an exorbitant amount of ammunition for military exercises. You must understand since you’ve seen it with your own eyes.”
“Well, that might be the case...” Kino said so, and gave a small nod.
“They’re definitely a threat. It’s a strong country with massive walls to protect it, in addition to having large amounts of weapons and ammunition in stock.... We can't help but fear the moment when that country comes to attack u. Right now there are no signs of such intent, but we will never let off our guard. That’s why we always come to watch their military exercises.""
“I see. Good job, working under this terrible heat.”
The men returned a bitter smile to Hermes’ remark.
“We’re already used to it. ——We’ll be coming next year as well.”


Upon parting with the men, Kino and Hermes continued to run along the seemingly endless forest road, in the hot and humid air.
Just as the road was running on the east-west direction, Kino lowered the brim of her hat. Right then, the forest’s greenery created just the right amount of shade.
“The fireworks were beautiful, weren’t they?” Hermes said, and Kino nodded.
“Yup. As I thought, large-scale ones are really different.”
“That was not normal, you know?”
“Yeah. But since it was so pretty, it’s good one way or another.”
“Oh, well.”
The luggage-laden motorrad ran through the forest dominated by the sound of crickets.

It's Weapons 101 here....


"
69,v10c3,10,3,"Building-like rock structures were lined up on the sandy land.
A bizarre space was created by hundreds of these rock pillars which towered over the land, acting as if the erosion from wind and rain was nothing.
Only a small amount of thin grass grew on the dry sand. The hot, dry wind was blowing occasionally through the spaces between the pillars. There was not a single cloud in the sky.
There were three humans beside one of the stone pillars. They were sitting underneath its short shadow.
One was a young person, wearing a white shirt and a black vest, with a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) suspended on her right thigh. Behind, a motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) loaded with traveling luggage was parked on its center stand.
The other two were a man and a woman in their late twenties who were wearing thin clothing. The woman had a slender face, and her long hair was tied behind her. In contrast, the man had a good body build. Behind the two, there were two luggage-laden horses.
“Then, what’s this important thing you want to talk about?” The young person asked.
“That is, I am appealing to you, Miss Kino, to stop using violence from now on,” the woman said.
The person called Kino let out a slightly surprised expression.
The woman looked straight at Kino with a serious face.
“I believe that instead of violence, kind feelings and overflowing love should come from the bottom of our hearts, and that conflicts should be avoided. I believe that this is the only righteous thing to do in the world. I would like to share this to you, Miss Kino, for you to practice in your journey from now on. It is not difficult. Love can solve all problems.”
The man sitting behind the woman stayed silent. He did not interfere, and just smiled quietly as he sat and watched over them.
“I may be forcing my way of thinking but, I think it is not impossible for all humans in this world to be one in thought. No matter what kind of person, wouldn’t he want water when his throat is dry? That’s an idea we all share in common, isn’t it? In exactly the same way, we can have the same belief: ‘There shouldn’t be any disputes between humans. Love can solve everything.’ And——”
The woman's tone became passionate.
“——After all, in the end all that is needed is love — an affectionate heart for others. The most important thing is love. It is inside everyone. It is a wonderful thing. If everyone uses the love that they have, and conflicts disappear, then our lives will be——”
She appealed, ignoring the sweat beading on her forehead.
“——With this, you surely understand why humans should not have weapons. If you realize that there is no need for fights, then there is no need for weapons either. Let’s guide this world one step further, united with one idea, with one concept of love. If everyone heads towards the same direction and make themselves lighter by throwing away the things they don’t need, only love will remain! The point is to make contact with such people! That is——”
Kino quietly listened to the woman’s fervent speech, making small nods while looking at her eyes.
“——Therefore, humans can live without conflicts. I myself practice this! I don’t carry a single weapon with me. I have met a variety of people during my journey, and I have never been in danger, not even once. The man behind me carries one, but he doesn’t use it except for hunting. Isn’t that amazing! It’s because I connect with the people through love, no one feels the need to be violent towards me! Isn’t it wonderful?! Everyone understands. People can understand each other! And so——”
The woman continued to talk frantically of her idea. Her speech continued on and on.
After some time has passed,
“——There! That’s everything I want to say!”
The woman, now drenched with sweat, finished her speech at last. She took a deep breath, and drank the already cold tea the man from behind passed to her.
“If it’s okay with you, please let me hear what you think about what I just said.”
Kino looked at the woman and spoke gently.
“I think it’s wonderful. I understood and absorbed everything that you said. Up to now, I have never hesitated to shoot in order to protect my life. But now, I see that it’s possible to have no need for such.”
“Yes! Exactly!” the woman said, almost bouncing with joy.
“From now on, I will also use your idea of ‘love’, and try to live without harming people. For starters, I would sell my persuaders to the next country I’m going to.”
“Yes. You did understand. I’m so glad!”
With narrowed eyes, the woman came in front of Kino and grasped both of her hands firmly.
“I’m so happy! I’m glad I met you, Miss Kino! From now on, if you find people who are like the previous you, who thinks violence is fine and has not wakened up to love and truth, please tell them this idea! If you do so, and everybody else shares this to everyone, then the number of people who will be awakened to love and truth will multiply, and soon all humans will use love to resolve conflicts! Okay? Ah..., thank you for listening to me!”


“Well then, we’ll be on our way. Be careful in your travels.” Kino stood up as she said this. She lifted the motorrad’s stand.
“Thank you. I’m sure everything will be fine. Let’s meet again somewhere!”
The woman waved happily. Kino bowed once to the two, pushed her motorrad, and went out to the sandy soil from underneath the rock pillar.
“Let’s go Hermes. That took lots of time,” she said to the motorrad.
“Yup,” was the small response of the motorrad called Hermes.
The man stood up as if he remembered something.
“Let me show the way to Miss Kino,” he said to the woman and followed Kino.
There were two hand persuader holsters on each side of the man’s hips, positioned in a way for him to be able to shoot with two hands. They were .45 caliber types, with extended magazine capacity. On the tip of the barrel, there was a screw thread for attaching a silencer.
The man went away from the woman and approached Kino who was just starting Hermes’ engine.
And he began to speak.
“Miss Kino, Hermes, thank you so much for listening to her boring and long-winded speech. And also, thank you for making her happy. You have my gratitude,” the man said with a smile.
Kino smiled wryly.
“If you weren’t right behind, we would have walked off right in the middle of her speech.”
“Hahaha. I thought you’d say something like that,” the man laughed gleefully.
Kino narrowed her eyes a little and spoke in a soft voice.
“One week ago, we found thirty men dead by a rocky area. All of them were killed without being able to fight back. I noticed .45 caliber bullets in their skulls. ——It was you, right?”
The man nodded.
“They did listen to her speech. However, I somehow figured later on that they were going to kill me and attack her because they were always following us. I took care of them silently,” the man said without batting an eyelash.
“This may be rude but... why is it that a person as skilled as you became her escort?”
“Yup, yup. That’s weird. It’s completely the opposite of what she was preaching.”
Kino and Hermes asked.
“Because I love her,” the man replied with a serious face. [2]
“Huh?” “Eh?”
“I’ve loved her for a long time. ——We were born in the same country, and were friends since we were young. She had been an anti-violence advocate even back then. She believes that violence will never do any good, and we will all be better off with love. But I have a completely opposing belief — those with no power cannot do anything. And believing that I can’t protect others if I’m weak, I learned all sorts of things necessary in combat such as martial arts, persuaders, and so on. After graduating from school, I joined the army. She was still completely engrossed in her ideals, and thought I was absurd to do so. And, I wonder when it started. I loved her from the bottom of my heart. My reasons do not matter. I love her. Whenever I would meet up with her when I go home on holidays, she would always remind me of how foolish violence is, but those were the happiest days of my life.”
The man took a glimpse behind. Sitting beside the rock, the woman was gazing up at the sky with a satisfied look on her face.
“One day, she said all of a sudden, ‘I’ll get out of this country, and go to a journey to preach love and non-violence. That will be my mission.’ She did not listen to the desperate pleas of the people around her, and began to make preparations for her departure. I quit the army and asked her to let me accompany her on her journey.”
“And she allowed you,” Kino asked.
“Well, it was simple. I said, ‘I left the army because I was moved by your wonderful ideals. Together, let’s appeal for love and non-violence. I want you to take me along, even if it’s just to carry your luggage.' She agreed immediately.”
“Okay...” “I see.”
“Even if I cannot completely practice her ideals, I still love to see her positive attitude. I love to see her recklessly pursuing her dreams. I want to protect her. ——I don’t care about principles or ideals, if it’s to protect her and stay by her side. I’ll stand by her. I’ll kill people, even if that would make me seem to be the bad guy. I don’t care if I turn the whole world my enemy,” the man said quietly.
“You’d annihilate everybody then,” Hermes jested from below.
Kino muttered,‘I see’, and then said, “Your story is much more interesting than hers.”
“Thanks. Take care. It would be nice if we can meet again somewhere.”
The man held out his right hand. And then,
“Until then, do not hesitate to shoot anyone who tries to kill you.”
“Thank you very much. I’ll do that.”
Kino gripped his hand.















"
70,v10c4,10,4,"The forest had been scorched.
The steep slopes of the bump-like mountains of the mountain range stood out. Over there, all of the trees were lined up in straight pillars, the branches of which were blackened from the fire. A number of charcoal pieces were lying about on top of the burnt and hardened ground.
Lead-colored clouds hung above the sky as if matching the dreary scenery. The morning sun which was supposed to be in the sky was nowhere to be found. From time to time, the clouds let one or two drops of rain fall.
There was a road which looked as if it was sewn on the mountainside. The width of the extreme up and down curves of the road could fit only one vehicle. Here and there were muddy puddles of water left on the exposed wet soil.
Running on this road was a single motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly).
A pipe carrier replaced the back seat, on top of which was a big bag. Boxes were attached on both sides of the rear wheel. A rolled sleeping bag and a brown coat were tied up on top of the bag.
The driver was a young person around mid-teens, wearing a black jacket and a wide belt tightened around the waist. Suspended from her right thigh was a holster for a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol), containing a revolver. She was wearing a brimmed hat covering both of her ears, and goggles strapped around her eyes.
The driver was riding carefully on the muddy road. She stopped at once in front of a big puddle, estimated its depth and passed through it in one breath.
“Hey, Kino.” While running, the motorrad below asked the driver.
The driver called Kino answered, “Hmm?”
""Do you remember how many countries we've visited up to now?”
Kino shook her head. “Nope. What about you, Hermes?”
“No way—. I asked because I thought you would know,” the motorrad called Hermes answered with a light tone.
Kino spoke, “I remember some of the countries very well. However, it’s impossible to remember all details. Even if I kept a diary, I wonder if it would be any different.”
""Hmm”
“Humans soon forget things which don’t leave them a strong impression. I might have forgotten some countries I’ve gone to, however...”
“However?” Hermes asked.
“Sometimes I think it is wonderful that humans can forget,” Kino answered while passing by a shallow puddle.
“What do you mean?""
“Think of it this way. Because humans can forget unpleasant and painful things, they can go on with their lives without wallowing in despair.”
“Oh, I see.""
“Well, that depends on the person. Sometimes remembering bad things can be good.”
“For instance, one knows from experience that tilting too much on a muddy road will result in slipping and falling, right?” Hermes asked.
“Well, I’m sorry.”
Kino’s left leg and left elbow, as well as the left packing box were dirtily caked with mud.
The snake-like mountain road went down to a valley and began to run side-by-side with a stream. The flow of the river was fast, and its water was cloudy.
Kino and Hermes continued to ride, and eventually the mountains ended and the road changed to a smooth and downhill path. Just ahead, a country could be seen.
The country enclosed with walls was built on a small plain in the valley basin. The river from the mountain flowed into the country, where it divided into a number of tributaries.
“At last we’ve arrived. That took some time,” said Hermes, and Kino answered.
“The road was so horrible it made me really tired... I want to relax for three days. I wonder if I can sleep in a hotel here.”
“Since we’ve gotten into so much trouble just trying to reach this place, I hope there are interesting places we can visit. It would be nice if there’s a festival or something.”
“A festival, eh? It would be nice if there’s one.”
Kino and Hermes kept running down the long and gentle slope.


“Here. The entry procedures are done. Thank you for waiting.”
The guard in the guard post between the city gates talked to Kino.
“By the way, did you come here in time for the ceremonies?”
“Ceremonies? No.” “What’s that?” Kino and Hermes asked.
“Oh, so you didn’t know. The fact is, today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, exactly during your three-day stay, we will be holding ‘The Great Flood Commemoration Ceremony’. We hold this ceremony on the same days each year, so that we would never forget about the great flood which occurred seven years ago.”
“There was a flood?” Kino asked immediately. The guard nodded with a smile.
""Yes. That was the most terrible flood ever. It was so horrible, that it may be the first and probably the last in this country's history. One week of heavy rains submerged the whole country, panic ensued, buildings were damaged, and casualties emerged. The muddy water did not subside for three whole days, and even after it did, pollution and infectious diseases became major problems. So that we would never lose those painful memories, we hold this ceremony on the same days, in every corner of the country.”
“I see.”
The guard spoke. ""Miss Kino, if you like, you can participate with the residents in the ceremony. You see, all of the citizens are obliged to take part in it.”
Kino passed through the walls while pushing along Hermes, and found themselves in a square.
“Something is going on already.”
A lot of people have gathered. A speech could be heard.
“——And we have survived that horrifying flood. With the memories of the victims in our hearts, we are grateful for the peaceful life we have now, and from here on, this country will rise to greater heights——”
Under the cloudy sky, a man on top of a stage was passionately addressing the people through a loudspeaker. Behind him were several representatives seated on chairs.
“——Never, yes, never shall we be able to forget those events, we vow to continue to live strongly——”
Kino slowly pushed Hermes and approached the congregation.
“——I speak here, safely, and would like to share the joy of the end of this ceremony in the morning at the eastern gate!”
When the warm speech was over, everyone gave silent prayers.
One of the citizens from the dispersing crowd noticed Kino.
After some greetings and self-introductions, this resident began to explain about the terrible flood seven years ago, and how it originated the commemoration ceremony. Almost all of his explanation was the same as the guard’s version, and lasted for a while.
“Look, miss traveler,” another resident showed the tick marks painted on the wall. There were marks high above the person’s head.
“The water reached up there at its highest. Isn’t that tremendous?”
A narrow river was flowing beside the square. A water inlet from the gate guided the water from the outside straight through.
""Normally, that’s a small stream, but that time a large amount of water flowed through it. More and more water came in even after the gates were closed. The rain did not stop. There was nothing we can do.”
Kino looked at the stream and the water inlet.
“Hey, did you see the remaining water level at the gates?” The resident asked. Kino furrowed her brows for a moment, and then quietly shook her head.


The whole country was spread over a flat plain.
One-storey houses made of wood were standing side by side along the neat and orderly farmlands. Creeks ran parallel with the roads, and the water drained into the vegetable fields. The embankments were made of ordinary soil, on the surface of which, tiny yellow flowers were blooming.
Kino rode leisurely and headed towards the center of the country. Large buildings were lined up towards the center. Kino found the hotel and entered.
They were guided to a room, where Kino placed Hermes and unloaded the luggage.
Afterwards, Kino climbed up to the roof of the two-storey hotel, where the laundry was being dried.
From there, the wall could be seen very well beyond a number of tall buildings, and beyond it was the basin enclosed by the mountains. Green mountain peaks were lined up downstream to the west, while upstream to the east the peaks were dark brown in color.
“......”
Kino looked at the sky. There, the usual clouds were floating.
“I should probably get back and have some sleep.”


In front of the room, a hotel employee spoke to Kino.
“Oh, so you were here. Miss traveler, everyone came out for this noon’s ceremony. We haven’t prepared lunch. If you don’t mind, you can come to the ceremony. A meal will be served there, and you can eat as much as you like.”
And then Kino entered the room.
“Therefore it's decided that I'll go,” she said to Hermes.
“What’s with ‘therefore’?” Hermes said.


There was a large park around the center of the country, near the hotel. There were paths and lawns, planted trees and a man-made pond.
In the center of the park was a large concrete platform, at the bottom of which was a statue of people riding on a boat. It was the monument for the great flood commemoration, and lit candles were lined up around it.
The big stage from earlier was placed in front of the monument; a makeshift tent served as its roof and in the middle of it was a podium with a microphone. A flag was hoisted at the center of the park with the words ‘Do not forget that day’ written on it.
A number of people have gathered. All of the chairs in front of the stage were filled. Around them, the heads of people who don’t have seats can be seen. In every corner of the square, tents of food and drinks were lined up, and people were busy moving about in preparation.
""Everyone looks so happy, is this actually a festival?” Hermes said.
Eventually, band members holding their musical instruments gathered beside the stage and sat down on their assigned seats. Various people of all ages climbed on stage, all dressed up. The microphone was tested.
The host went up the stage and proceeded with a lengthy introductory speech. The ceremony has begun.
First, everyone gave short, silent prayers.
And then, the people continued the leader’s oration.
Next, the host introduced and honored the firemen, seated on the prestigious seats in the front row, who were known for their heroic deeds during the time of the flood. 
Subsequently, the people on-stage were introduced, and were asked to give a speech one by one. A middle-aged woman ‘touched with the warm feelings of the people in the shelters'; A man who, ‘after losing his job, was encouraged by people under the same circumstances'; and a schoolteacher who, ‘together with his students, replanted the roadside trees which were swept away during the flood.'
The ceremony continued at length.
“Wake me up when it’s over,” said Hermes, who soon became quiet.
The last speech of a girl was about how, after she lost her father, she was able to continue on with her life thanks to the support of the kind people around her. When she let her father in heaven know that she’s doing well in the form of a letter, the audience came to tears.
“Miss traveler, here take this.”
A piece of paper with lyrics written on it was passed over to Kino, and at the same time,
“Then, so as not to forget that day, let us all sing the ‘Requiem’. Let us send our feelings to heaven.”
After hearing the host’s voice, the conductor made a bow and swung his baton, and the band started playing.
The chorus sang, and the audience sang together with it.
Kino looked at the lyrics.
“Requiem ~Do Not Forget That Day~”
It was a quiet spring day
It was supposed to be a peaceful spring day
A single drop of rain became gazillion drops, showering the ground
A single day of rain became nine days of rain, showering the country
And we cried, what in the world is happening!
At last, the night of the tenth day came
That time, our homeland was
Chorus:
struck by a muddy stream (struck)
struck by a muddy stream (struck)
Oh, what in the world is happening!
The country was like an ocean, the houses were like islands
The peaceful dining table was suddenly covered with muddy water, the dishes floated, grandfathers drowned
Many people lost their lives, lost their homes, lost their havens
That day, our homes were
(Repeat Chorus)
And that time
Our unity was put to the test (put to the test)
Our courage was put to the test (put to the test)
Finally the water subsided, rivers returned to being rivers, the ground dried up
No matter how much time will pass, we won't forget that day
And so,
We want to tell all of you in heaven:
We won't forget that day
We won't forget (won't forget)
We won't forget (won't forget)
About that day
When the song was finished, there was a big applause, and the ceremony ended.
Some people went home, some stayed to chat, but most people lined up beside the tents giving away food.
Kino slapped Hermes awake, and lined up. During the time of the flood, the people cannot obtain food, and for several days after, food was rationed continuously throughout the country. In order to recreate the event, the people line up to get food, a nearby person told Kino.
“So as not to forget that time, right?”
After lining up for a long time, Kino received her meal. There were two rice balls and boiled soup of vegetables and meat. She sat down beside Hermes and ate.
After the meal, Hermes asked, “What do we do next?”
“We saw the festival,” Kino answered. “So we have an opportunity to go out and get the things we need.”


Kino went out of the park and headed towards a nearby shopping district. The place was alive with the hustle and bustle of people coming home from the ceremony.
She looked for a store selling clothes, and inquired with the saleslady.
“Do you have a white shirt?”
“What do you think about this?”
Upon saying this, the saleslady showed her a shirt. At the back, the words, ‘Seven years have passed since then: I am proud to have survived that disaster’, were printed in big letters. On the left chest, there was a cute embroidery depicting a submerged house.
“......”
“It’s a bit more expensive compared to normal shirts, but it’s a very popular souvenir from this country. As to other——”
The saleslady showed a kiddie shirt with the words, ‘This year I'm taller than the flood's water level in the country’s center.' A hat with ‘If you're old, be proud. You have survived that spring day’s flood.' A coat marked with the street’s water level at the back, and so on.
“Aren’t there any... normal ones?” Kino asked.
“Well, right now these are our best sellers, so we don’t have other items lined up,” The saleslady answered.
Kino gave up on the shirt, headed to a tool shop next, and inquired for the knife inventory. There were only knives with big carvings on the grip, saying ‘7th year anniversary: Spring has come again.'
Without much choice, she then looked for a sharpening stone. One was being sold in a special commemoration pouch. Kino asked for the price of this item.
“That’s too expensive. Don’t you have anything cheaper?”
“Well, it’s because of the anniversary. Isn’t the pouch nice?”
“It’s just stone, right?”
“These are the only stuff we have until the day after tomorrow. But, right now, everyone will gladly buy it.”
“O...kay...”
Without buying anything, Kino went next to the ammunition shop.
Kino asked the male shopkeeper in advance.
“Hey, do you have 7th year anniversary hand persuader bullets? .44 caliber enamel points?” She asked, approaching the back of the shop, and there was a quick reply,
“I’m sorry, miss traveler. We only have normal ones.” The shopkeeper said apologetically.


It began to rain soon after she came back to the hotel. The heavy rain fell noisily.
“That was close. We would have been soaked to the skin,” said Hermes.
“......”
Kino was silent, and looked at the scenery outside.
And then, Kino caught sight of one of the employees, and spoke. “Quite a downpour, huh?” 
“Yeah, it’s like this every year, during this season. By the way it’s odd; until now, the season’s rain was scarce, and the river’s water had considerably decreased to a good level. With only this much, there can be no floods or landslides.”
“I see...”
Upon returning to the room, Hermes asked Kino, “Is something the matter? You seemed thoughtful at times since yesterday.”
Kino answered, “I have forgotten...”
“Huh?”
“I feel as if I’ve forgotten something.”
“What ‘something’?”
Kino tilted her head. “...What could it be?”


The next morning.
As Kino woke up and looked outside, she found that the rain lasted throughoutthe night. It’s almost dawn, but the sky seemed close, and very dark.
After disassembling and cleaning the revolver she called ‘Canon’, Kino proceeded with her quick draw exercises.
The sky has not brightened a bit even after breakfast, and the rain has maintained its strength.
Upon returning to the room, Hermes spoke to Kino. “Are you planning to relax and rest all day?” 
“Yeah.”
In the room, Kino performed a brief maintenance check of Hermes, and inspected her luggage afterwards. She sharpened several knives with an old stone.
Even after finishing this, the rain outside still hasn’t stopped. Kino turned on the radio in the room.
‘——And for this 7th year anniversary, we will be bringing you live until the end the ceremony proceedings scheduled starting lunch. For we will never forget that day——’
“......”
Kino turned thoughtful once again.
“Did you remember?”
She shook her head in response to Hermes’ question.
“It’s no use. ——For the meantime...”
Kino stood up.
“For the meantime?”
“I’ll go ask if I can eat lunch here.”
Kino left the room.


Kino received her ration right after asking the employees if the food will be distributed for lunch. At the same time, she heard from the weather forecast that the rain will be continuing until the next day.
""This downpour is a good thing. The winter was so dry that the forest fires did not even dissipate.”
“I see.”
Just as Kino turned to go back to her room,
“!”
She turned back to the employee. “When did those forest fires started?”
“Eh? Well, about one month ago. Perhaps, a lightning bolt started the fire, and then it continued to burn for several days. The nights after that were so beautiful. The fires began to burn around the mountain at about the same time we were preparing for the anniversary.""
Kino nodded several times, with a quiet expression. “I see...”


“Hermes!”
Upon returning to the room, Kino quickly stuffed the biscuits and canned sausages in the bag.
“W-what?”
“We’ll leave now.”
Kino hauled the luggage on Hermes, and tied a folded tarp over it to protect it from the rain.
“Huh?”
Kino took her coat, hat and goggles, fastened her belt, and checked Canon on her right thigh.
“This rain might cause another great flood. Let’s leave this country right away.”
“Eh? Didn’t they say that the rain falls like this every year? Then shouldn't it be okay?” Hermes asked.
“That’s right but, I remember now.”
“Oh, what is it?”
“A woodcutter I met back in Master’s place told me. ‘A burned forest is no longer a forest. Never stay in a valley downstream the forest fire,’ he said. It appears that the force that holds the water in the forest drops. That’s why it’s normal for the water in the river to go down. But, once heavy rain comes down.... I finally remembered. I do not have any evidence, but his place is very low, and I have a somewhat bad feeling, so I want to get out of this country as soon as possible. Do you get it, Hermes?”
“That’s fine, but, what about your three-day rule?”
“What do we do if there’s no more life to protect?”
“I see. So to speak, ‘While there’s life,——’”
“‘——there’s hope.' Let’s go.”
“......”
Kino checked out of the hotel without giving any particular reason.
Then she wore her hat, strapped her goggles on, closed the collar of her coat, wrapped the bandana around her face, and rode into the rain.
In the furious downpour, Kino headed to the western walls and immediately departed. On the muddy road, she rode without stopping until she reached the western end of the basin.
Once again, they ascended the road away from the river.
Then Kino said, “This area is good. Let’s stop beside this steep slope.”
Before entering the deep mountain valley road, Kino got off the road, and placed Hermes under a thick tree on top of a hill.
She stretched the tarp and rope to make a shelter from the rain. Then she flattened the grass underneath with her foot and assembled her small one-person tent. She placed Hermes beside it.
She put her wet hat and goggles on Hermes. She squeezed the bandana, wiped Hermes’ tank, and dried it on Hermes’ handle.
Kino leaned on the trunk of the tree and began to eat her lunch. Water droplets hanging from the branch would occasionally drop inside her coat.
“Aaah. ... I hate rainy days.”
“My condolences. If you stayed in the country, you will be under a roof, on a bed with white sheets, and a hot shower waiting for you.”
“Jeez”
After eating, she sat back and relaxed.
“......”
The visibility was very poor far into the mist. The big water droplets from the tree hit the tarp occasionally.
The rain continued through the night. The rainfall did not wane in strength.


The next morning.
As usual, Kino woke up at the crack of dawn.
The rain had stopped. Kino crawled out of the tent, wearing her jacket, and Canon in her right hand.
“Good morning, Kino. It’s great to see that you slept well,” said Hermes.
Kino got out beneath the tarp and stretched her back. “Yeah. ——It’s great.""
She looked at the scenery through the thin morning light.
The basin has spread to the east, to the surrounding walls. The basin has turned into a big swamp. The muddy color has spread over the water’s surface.
Gradually, as it became brighter and the sun came out, the country’s appearance could be clearly seen. The river coming to the country from the eastern mountain overflowed, as well as its tributaries inside the country. It looked as if the buildings in the middle were floating, and only the roof of the houses could be seen.
“It’s a great flood. Do you think it set a new record?”
“Oh dear...,” Kino murmured.
“As I thought, perhaps they did not replace the gates since the previous flood. The water intake was the same, but the bank of the river is lower.”
“By now, the people of that country may have remembered that flood a long time ago. Or maybe they have forgotten. Which one do you think it is?”
“Who knows?”
She put away the tent and the tarp while taking in the scent of the wet forest.
After finishing her breakfast of portable food, she loaded all of her luggage, and revved Hermes’ engine.
Kino looked up at the lush green mountain.
“Let’s go then. I was told the road here is pretty safe.""
“Roger.”
Kino started Hermes off.
She rode off to the west, on the muddy road.
And then, on the seventh curve to the left, she slipped and fell.
While lying down, Hermes got angry.
“I-told-you-! There is very little friction in a muddy road, so you’re not supposed to tilt while riding!”
“My bad, Hermes.”
“Yes. Quickly raise me up, raise me up!”
“Upsy-daisy,” Kino raised up Hermes. Her left leg and left elbow, as well as the left packing box were dirtily caked with mud.
“Jeez. Don’t tell me you’ve completely forgotten?”
""Nope."" Kino shook her head While wiping the mud off a nearby tree’s leaves and bark.
“I thought it would go smoothly this time.”
“Is that so?”
Kino started Hermes once more.
“It’s okay,” Kino said while running.
“What is?” Hermes quickly asked in return.
“I think I can pull it off next time.”
“That’s enough.”
“I’ll pull it off for sure.”
“I told you it’s enough.”
“I already got the hang of it. I’ll be able to do it.”
“No, thank you.”
“The rear wheels should flow as well.”
“Not good.”
“The method is to reverse turn the handle——”
“Stop it.”
The motorrad ran through the green forest.














"
71,v10c5,10,5,"There was a forest.
The dense forest was spread over a flat land. Tall trees with narrow leaves, wide trees that shed their leaves during winter, and a various jumble of green things were mixed together in the forest. A thin layer of moss grew on the ground which was barely exposed to sunlight.
Inside the forest, there was an almost perfectly straight road. All over the bumpy road’s surface were traces of accumulated water. Occasionally, the roots of thick trees run across the ground, disturbing its flatness.


‘What a bad road,’ remarked a running motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly). There were boxes on both sides of its rear wheel, with a big bag, a sleeping bag, and a coat on top. The motorrad was heavily loaded with traveling luggage.
‘But still, this is a shortcut,’ said the motorrad’s driver. She was a young person in her midteens, wearing a black jacket, a hat, and goggles. The front of her jacket as well as the wide belt for it was wide open to let in the early summer wind. She was wearing a white shirt underneath.
On the driver’s right thigh was a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) holster, containing a high-caliber revolver. On her back was another one – a small automatic type.
The motorrad was running through the forest road without using up much speed, avoiding and clearing the scattered obstacles. The surrounding trees reluctantly opened up a relatively straight road right ahead.
A strong wind blew, and the forest trembled. The leaves danced, fell on the motorrad’s tank and the driver’s head one by one, and once again were blown away by the wind.
The driver looked up at the sky through the branches of the trees; swarms of small grey clouds were being carried away by the wind.
‘The wind has become stronger, maybe it’s going to rain,' said the motorrad, and the driver replied, ‘I hate getting wet.' The driver added, ‘If we find a large tree, let's stop. I should probably collect some firewood,’ and dropped the speed of the motorrad.
Once again the wind noisily blew through the forest. The motorrad said in a surprised tone, ‘Wait a minute Kino, there’s a building,’ and the driver called Kino stepped on the brakes.
‘A building? Is it a house, Hermes?’ Kino asked the motorrad. The motorrad called Hermes replied, ‘If I had to day, then I'd probably say it's a school or a town hall.'
Kino looked left and right, but could only see the forest. ‘Where is it?’ she asked. Hermes said, ‘From here, enter a bit to the right side of the forest,’ and added, ‘The land is flat so I'll be able to run’.
‘Could there be someone living there?’ Kino asked. ‘None at all, definitely,’ answered Hermes.
Kino chose a flat surface, and entered the forest with Hermes.


The building was inside the woods. It was hidden by the shadows created by the trees.
The building was made of stone and bricks. It was wide, has two storeys, and looked like a small school. The large square foundation stone was constructed symmetrically. At its center was the wide entrance, the fallen doors decayed below. Above it, there was a protrusion which may have served as a clock tower. It was lined left and right with two or three spacious rooms.
The building was in tatters. The sloping roof which might have been originally of a red color has almost completely faded and was spotted with the brown and black of fallen dead leaves. A dense layer of ivy has crawled over the dirty cream-colored walls. All of the glass windows were gone, leaving gaping square holes.
Thick and tall trees beside the building were competing in enclosing the building. It's as if they did not want to let it escape. Some of the roots have dug into the foundation which has begun to break.
Kino and Hermes were in front of the building.
‘Another splendidly battered building, eh,’ said Hermes. Kino got off Hermes and carefully put down the stand.
‘Is there something inside?’ Kino asked, and Hermes answered, ‘Some lizards, and a lot of bugs.'
In the strong wind, Kino entered the dark mouth of the wide-open entrance. After a while, she went out.
Hermes asked how it looked inside, and Kino said that the floor was still tiled and intact, and there was not a single place where the roof has caved in.
‘Just right. Let's sleep here for today,’ said Kino, and ‘We can keep out of the rain, too,’ Hermes agreed.


It couldn't be seen from the place where Kino and Hermes were right now, but much deeper in the forest, there were hundreds and thousands of buildings lined up at regular intervals — all of them were collapsed and completely wrecked by the trees.


Kino started Hermes’ engine and passed through the entrance. She turned on the headlight, and a white light shined through the dark hallway. The place was muffled with the damp and stagnant air, along with a smell similar to that of the forest’s soil.
The hallway extended on both sides. They turned to the right and slowly rode while the hum of the engine resounded in the dark hallway. The wall has blackened and the wallpaper has peeled in several places. Light shining through a small, shattered wardrobe created a shadow.
Kino rode Hermes into a room. It was located in the right corner of the building. There was nothing inside the room, which might have been originally a classroom. A weak wind entered through the frameless windows, and the leaves on the tiled floor shook.
Kino stopped Hermes near the entrance and cut off his engine. The echoing roar of the engine stopped, and a suffocating silence drifted in the room.
Kino stood Hermes on his center stand, producing a metallic noise.
And then,
“I’ll borrow this place,” Kino said to no one in particular. [2]


Blue people watched Kino and Hermes.
They were like thin, obscure, blue light or fog, but with the form and size of humans. Also, they had no noses or mouths, only two eyes, located where they're supposed to be. The eyes were staring at Kino.
There were about ten people in the room. There were tall ones, and short, child-like ones as well. They surrounded and continued to stare at Kino and Hermes.
‘Well, you have to clean first,’ said Hermes. ‘Yup,’ Kino agreed. Kino examined the dirt of the floor by scratching it with her foot. She went to the center of the room, and the blue people who were there glided soundlessly away from her.
‘I need to brush away the leaves. I'll go get a branch to use as a broom. Wait a minute.’
As Kino said this, she placed her hat and goggles on Hermes and went out of the room.
The blue people stood, closely packed together, along the dark hallway. They gazed in unison at Kino as she went out. Kino found that the door at the end of the hallway was gone, and headed for another exit. The blue people made way for Kino, and soundlessly followed the passing Kino from behind.
The blue people stayed behind the exit, and stared at Kino as she went out of the building.
Kino broke off a branch with leaves, and returned carrying it with her left hand.
Upon returning to the room, ‘Now let’s start cleaning,’ said Kino, and began to sweep the leaves from the floor with the branch. The blue people continued to stare, and drew away as if not to interfere with the cleaning.
Kino gathered the leaves and placed the branch on top so the leaves would not scatter. The tiled floor was somewhat cleaner than before. She stretched the tarp she usually used against the rain with the rope, removed the boxes from Hermes’ rear wheel and laid them down. Then she laid the luggage in a corner of the room away from the window, and chose where she would sleep. There she put the sleeping bag and the big bag. The blue people continued to stare at Kino.
‘I’m done. This is much better than camping out,’ Kino said. Hermes agreed.
‘Now, only gathering firewood is left,’ Kino said. She took out a cloth bag from one of the boxes, held it in her left hand, and went out to the forest once more.
When Kino returned to the room, the blue people gazed at her all at once. Inside the bag were plenty of dry leaves and branches. Kino removed her waist belt, and took off her jacket.
‘That was close,’ said Hermes, and Kino nodded. At about the same time, rain trickled down from the sky, now thick with clouds. Soon the drizzle turned to rainfall. Among the blue people staring at Kino and Hermes, some looked outside through the window.
The rain was quiet at first, and then noisily and continuously fell, dampening the forest and the building. From the window, splashing water droplets shimmered as they jumped into the room.
On top of the tiles at the center of the room, Kino placed the dried leaves and thin branches, and placed the thick branches on top. The blue people gazed at Kino’s skill.
Kino took out a matchbox from one of her belt pouches, and took just one waterproof match. She carefully rubbed the match, waited until it was burning, and then transferred the flame. The leaves, then the thin branches burned, and eventually the fire settled down.
A small bonfire was born in the center of the room. The white smoke drifted towards the window, lingered a bit, and was soon quietly drawn out.
From the box, Kino took out two pieces of thin, long-legged, U-shaped iron bars, and joined them together. Then she placed the tripod on top of the bonfire. On top, she placed a dull, silver-colored cup, and filled it with water from her canteen.
Kino sat down at the edge of the tarp, facing the fire. She sat with her legs in front of her.
‘It’s a bit early, but I'll have my meal.' As Kino said this, she took out her portable rations from the bag behind her. The food was long, rectangular, and clay-like, and was wrapped in paper. Then she put it back Without opening it. ‘I’ll have this for today,’ she said and took out a tin of canned food instead.
The canned food was big and thin. A cow was drawn on its peeling paper label.
Kino took out a camper knife from one of her pouches, and pulled out the can-opener. She opened the can and opened the lid without clipping it off. The blue people peeped at the contents of the can from behind Kino. Inside was thinly sliced meat cooked with several pieces of garlic.
The water in the cup became hot and soon came to a boil. Kino took the cup with her thickly-gloved right hand, and replaced it immediately with the tin of canned food. She adjusted the burning branches so that the fire wouldn’t be too strong; just hot enough to warm the meat.
From the box on Hermes’s rear wheel, Kino took out a lunchbox-like rectangular can. She slowly opened the tightly sealed lid and placed it on top of the tarp. The inside of the can was divided in two. One half contained tightly packed tea paper packs, and the remaining half contained crumbling sugar cubes.
She squeezed out one tea pack with her left hand and put it in the hot water. Soon the water was stained with the tea's color. And then, she dropped one sugar cube.
Outside the window, the rain continued to fall, making quiet sounds like that of a cloth ripping apart. The outline of the trees in the forest became blurry with the thin sprays of water.
‘It’s a good thing we are under a roof.’ Kino agreed with Hermes’ words. While the blue people surrounded and stared at them, Kino slowly sipped her tea.
When the meat was ready and simmering, Kino adjusted the fire a bit more. After a few sips of tea, she said, ‘It’s mealtime.' She then put on her glove with her left hand, grasped the lid of the tin, and lifted it from the tripod.
Kino took out a small foldable spoon from one of her pouches. She pierced the meat with the slightly cracked tip. The blue people stared as Kino carried the meat to her mouth——, and exclaimed, ‘Ho—t!’
‘I knew it,’ Hermes said.


In the room where Hermes was parked, Kino was sitting on top of the tarp, leisurely drinking her second cup of tea.
An empty can was lying beside the small flame of the bonfire. The rain continued to fall outside the windows.
The blue people were still in the room. The shadow or fog-like blue people were staring at Kino and Hermes, who were happily talking about their plans for the next day.


It was still raining when the night fell and the forest became dark.
From the holster of her unfastened belt, Kino took out her .44 caliber revolver she called ‘Canon’. When the blue people saw the shiny black persuader appear, they trembled and their eyes opened wide.
Kino raised the hammer with her thumb. It clicked, and the blue people trembled at the same time. Each time Kino checked if the parts were still functioning, it produced a clicking sound, which instantly made the blue people tremble for a while.
Still holding Canon, Kino untied the rolled sleeping bag. She opened the zipper on its side and spread it over the tarp. The blue people moved away soundlessly.
Kino set aside her sleeping place against the wall, and then approached the faintly flickering flame of the bonfire. She broke and spread the burning branches, and soon the flame disappeared.
The room was finally dark. The square, gray color of the scenery outside the window seemed like a paper cut-out floating amidst the dark.
Kino moved on top of the sleeping bag. She lied down, left her boots outside, and put herself inside the sleeping bag. The rolled hood served as her pillow. Only Canon which she held in her right hand was sticking out of the sleeping bag.
‘Isn’t it cold?’ asked Hermes. ‘With this rain, I don’t think the temperature could get any lower,’ Kino said while lying down.
‘See you tomorrow then,’ Kino said. She closed her eyes and soon fell asleep.
The blue people, still blue even in the dark, stood inside the room, staring at Kino and Hermes.


The rain stopped in the middle of the night, and the clouds were pushed away by the wind.
Before long, the bright, glimmering stars appeared on the surface above the forest.
And nobody was there to see it.


Dawn came to the forest, and color returned to the damp atmosphere.
Inside the sleeping bag, Kino opened her eyes.
The thin blue morning light entered the room from the window. Nothing changed in the scenery during the previous night.
While the blue people looked on, Kino stood up and stretched her body, still holding Canon. She put on her jacket and fastened the belt.
She walked towards the window, and the blue people standing there moved away. Outside the window, the morning mist has spread beyond, concealed by the trees. The chirping of birds could be heard.
Kino went out of the building. She stopped in front of the room where they slept, and performed light warm-up exercises on the muddy ground. Then with a magazine still attached to Canon, she practiced her quick draw. The blue people watched everything from the window — Kino drawing her persuader repeatedly.
Kino returned to the room and sat on top of the tarp.
The sky and the room were bright. While the blue people observed, Kino disassembled, cleaned, and reassembled Canon. Kino also performed a light tune-up on the one behind her waist, the automatic-type persuader she called ‘Woodsman’.
On the remains of the bonfire, Kino placed branches and lit a fire. She made the same tea, but ate the portable rations this time.
'Now then,’ said Kino and began to clean up. She cooled the tripod and lightly rinsed the cup. She wiped her face with a damp cloth, and looked once at the collar of her shirt.
When she finished rolling and tying the sleeping bag on top of the bag, the sun has already risen. Its rays were passing through the gaps of the trees in the forest.
Kino literally slapped Hermes awake.
‘Ah, good morning,’ said Hermes, and Kino said, ‘The weather is good today.' Hermes said, ‘But the road must be muddy.'
Then Kino said, ‘Let's find a river at once, where we can wash and take a bath.'
When all of the luggage has been loaded, she scattered the remains of the bonfire and buried the empty tin under the dead leaves. The blue people lined up inside the room and looked at Kino once more.
‘I haven’t left anything,’ Kino said. She hung the goggles down her neck and put her hat on.
Kino went across Hermes, kicked the starter, and started the engine in one shot. The roar of the engine rebounded in the room, and escaped to the forest through the window.
The blue people stared at Kino and Hermes. Soon, Kino straddled on Hermes, and removed the weight from the stand. She went to the middle of the room and broke into a little run. The blue people drew away.
With her left foot still on, she tilted Hermes and started the accelerator. She let the rear wheel slip and changed Hermes’ orientation abruptly. She went out the room like this, running through the corridor lined up left and right with the blue people. From the building’s central entrance, she went out towards the space surrounded by the forest trees.
Kino looked back at the building. In the windows, and by the entrance, the densely packed blue people stood and looked at Kino and Hermes.
‘Shall we go, then?’ Kino said to Hermes, and Hermes replied, ‘Let’s go.'
Kino looked up front, and then turned back one more time.
“Thank you.” [3]
Kino said softly, facing the building. Then she faced up front and launched Hermes off.
While looking at the motorrad slowly riding over the muddy road, the blue people waved their hands.
Inside the forest, there was a decaying building surrounded by trees, grass, and ivy. It was lit by the bright morning light. From all of its windows, blue people were looking out, waving their hands.
Waving their hands, forever and ever.















"
72,v10c6,10,6,"There was a road bordering the edge of a lake.
The opposite shore of the enormous lake could not be seen, and the horizon seemed endless. The small waves born from the wind were pounding against the stony shore. The road was a reasonable distance away from the lake, on a slightly upraised area where the stone hardened, continuing to some unknown place.
Tall forests sprouted across the land, and could be seen well under the light of the clear morning. There were no more traces of snow.
Along the road were several points that intersect with a river. Surmounting the road, the cold water of the broad and shallow river blended into the lake.
Near this river, inside the forest a bit ways off the road, a single motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) was parked. There was a human beside it.
The person was around mid-teens, with short black hair, and big eyes carrying an intrepid expression.
She was wearing a black jacket with a wide belt fastened around the waist. Several pouches were attached on the belt. On her right thigh and at the back of her waist were holsters for hand persuaders (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol). The one on her right thigh was a revolver-type. The one behind her waist with its grip up, was a slim automatic-type.
She pulled out the revolver from her right thigh and fired at waist height. It made a tremendous sound, and a white smoke drifted from it. The bullet hit an iron plate which looked like a chopping board, suspended from a tree far away. The birds flew away at once.
“Hit,” said the motorrad. The human had a slightly satisfied look on her face. This time she stretched her right hand out a bit and fired five shots in quick succession. The iron plate swung and danced as all of the bullets hit it.
“Your skills are as good as ever, Kino. Good job,” said the motorrad. The human called Kino thanked him, and the motorrad spoke again in return.
“Well, shouldn’t we be leaving soon?”
“Nope. Just a bit more.”
While saying so, Kino disassembled the persuader and replaced the emptied cylinder. She reassembled it back and returned it to the holster.
Kino walked up to the iron plate, and hung it again on a tree twice as far.
She walked back up to the motorrad. She pulled the persuader behind her waist with her left hand. She reached for and released the safety and aimed at the iron plate.
“Hermes, I'm in your hands.”
“Leave it to me,” the motorrad called Hermes replied. Kino fired. The gunshot was quieter than before, and the small empty cartridge flied out.
“Hit. Right in the middle,” said Hermes. Another shot was fired.
“Hit. A bit to the lower left.”
For each one of Kino’s shots, Hermes reported where the bullet hit.
Kino fired off the rest of the second magazine, put in a third one and locked the safety. She returned it to the holster and went to retrieve the iron plate.
“Superb. Master would've been satisfied,"" said Hermes when Kino returned.
""Yup, thanks. That’s enough practice for today.”
Kino removed the cotton stuffed in both of her ears, put them away in her pocket, and picked up all of the scattered empty cartridges. She then turned on Hermes’ engine. The engine’s sound echoed through the lake.
Kino put the iron plate in a bag lying beside Hermes. She stowed the bag on Hermes’ rear carrier, and secured it firmly with a rubber strap.
“By the way, Kino. Is the country we’re going to next that dangerous? You were practicing a lot since yesterday.”
“Huh? I don't know.”
""Don't know?""
“The truth is I don’t have an idea. I have too little information, see. But I should always be prepared. It might be similar to the last country we've visited. ...Well, shall we go?”
Kino finished loading the luggage, and checked if she left anything behind.
She put on her long brown coat and wrapped the long hem up to her thighs. She wore her hat whose flaps covered her ears, and strapped her goggles on.
She sat on Hermes and released the kickstand.
Kino launched Hermes off and returned to the road from the forest, riding with the sun behind them.


It was about noon when they arrived at a country facing the lake.
“Hello, miss traveler. Welcome to our country.”
Outside the country’s walls, on the window counter by the gate, the immigration inspector greeted the traveler who came riding a motorrad.
“Hi. I’m Kino and this here is Hermes. We would like to enter this country for sightseeing and recreation. We are hoping for a three-day stay.”
As Kino said this, the inspector looked at Hermes and asked.
“Uhm, that motorrad, Mr. Hermes, will also be staying in the country?”
“Of course,” Hermes said and Kino nodded. The inspector looked worried for a moment, and then spoke.
“Uhm, this is hard to say, but, please do not be offended.... The thing is, if the driver Miss Kino here does not agree to sign a pledge saying that Mr. Hermes’ engine will not be used, we cannot allow Mr. Hermes to enter the country. You see, in this country, driving a motorrad is prohibited by law.”
“Driving is prohibited?”
“Huh? Then how do we move about then?” Hermes asked from behind.
“We have a completely safe and free unattended public transportation system. It’s like a car, but it’s free of charge and can be instructed to go anywhere you like. There’s enough space for Mr. Hermes to ride in, so you don’t have to worry about transportation. If you can promise not to start the engine, just that...”
Kino thought for a while. “I understand. I promise not to ride.”
“Kino?”
“It can’t be helped, Hermes. ‘When in Rome, do as the Romans do.'” Kino said, and Hermes spoke in a somewhat convinced tone.
“I understand. ——Well, compared to that other country where you were forced to wear weird clothes, this is way better.”
“... I don’t want to recall that,” murmured Kino.
“Thank you very much. Then please sign the pledge in these documents.”
The inspector happily held out the documents to Kino, as well as the writing instrument he was holding. It was a fine brush. Kino made a strange face for a moment.
“Ah, this is what we use in our country. The ink is over here.”
“Sure...”
Kino somehow managed to sign the documents, promising that she would not turn on Hermes’ engine while in the country. The inspector checked it.
“Okay. Thank you very much. We will prepare the gates immediately. Ah, do you happen to have any persuader with you?”
“I do,” Kino said, and took out from beneath her coat the revolver-type, grasping it by the barrel, its grip up. Kino called this 'Canon'. The other one on her back was called 'Woodsman'.
As Kino raised her face, the inspector suddenly jumped from his seat and fled to the far end of the room with the window. He hid behind a locker and timidly looked at Kino and the persuader.
“Th-that too..., is not allowed to be brought in our country,” he said from a distance.
“Eh?”
“Y-you see, in our country, civilian possession of persuaders is completely prohibited by law. In this country, only the members of the national defense force have persuaders. If you insist on taking it with you, it’s a pity, but, we cannot allow you to enter the country. Please understand.”
The inspector, which looked more apologetic than before, explained from afar.
“Now, Kino. What will you do?”
“That’s really a problem. I’ll have to go unarmed?”
Kino looked at 'Canon' in her hand with a really troubled expression on her face. Hermes spoke.
“‘Romans’, ‘Romans’, ‘Romans’.”
“Fine...,” muttered Kino. She went towards the inspector, and held out ‘Canon’.
“I understand. There’s no other way, right? And I've got one more. Will you please take care of these until we leave?”
“No, that’s impossible! ——Ah, I’m sorry. I’m afraid of persuaders. Ah, please do not show it to me! Eeek——”
The inspector completely hid himself behind the locker.


In the end, Kino disassembled all of her persuaders and put them in a safety deposit box provided by the inspector. It was decided that the box would be sent to the western gate and would be kept there for the meantime, until Kino’s departure.
The inspector then processed the documents. It took a while before the task was finished.
And then the inspector spoke. “Well, sorry for the wait. We’ll be opening the gate.... Ah! Uhm, do you have a knife, by any chance? In our country, civilian possession of knives is exclusively prohibited by law——”
Kino nodded several times without changing her expression.
“Yes, I have. I have lots. ... Excuse me, but can you tell me what else is prohibited in this country?”


""Finally,” Kino said upon passing through the gate.
“I’m so tired,” Hermes said while being pushed by Kino.
The documents were furnished after she surrendered all of her knives. The inspector told Kino which of her other belongings were prohibited by law. In the end, Kino wasn’t able to take her cutlery along with sharpening tools, and for some unclear reason, even the rope used in stretching a tent.
The sun was setting beautifully when Kino entered the country.
The inside of the walls was spacious, and many one-storey buildings were built at regular intervals. The completely paved roads were wide and in good condition. Since it was evening, there were not much people around.
Kino took off the coat she was wearing and placed it on top of the luggage. And then she muttered while looking at the now empty holster in her right thigh.
“Was my diet successful? My body feels so light. Oh, well...”
Kino looked at the road. After a while, a running car stopped silently right in front of Kino and Hermes. Several seats were lined up inside it, but nobody was aboard.
A voice saying ‘Please come aboard’ was heard from the car as the door slid open. Some of the seats folded and became a flat loading platform. The car lowered down until the loading platform was on the same level as the road surface.
“It’s ‘unattended’ alright,” Hermes said. Similar cars run about now and then. Kino understood, lifted Hermes onto the platform, and sat on one of the chairs.
‘Where are we going?’ the voice came, and Kino gave a loud order to head to the hotel.
‘Understood,’ came a reply, and the car began to run. It was very slow, about the speed of a running person.
Hermes spoke. “I see. This way, it’s like you were just running on your own.”
“Easy is easy,” Kino said while sitting comfortably on the chair.
After Kino and Hermes arrived to the hotel, they received a typical welcoming greeting and were guided to their room.
The room was spacious, but it was strange. There were several furniture items, but all were very low. Whether it’s the bed, the closet, the washstand, or the desk, nothing was over knee-height. There was no bathtub in the bathroom.
“I want to go sightseeing but I’ve had enough for today.”
Kino ate her meal, took a shower, and went to sleep.


The next day.
Kino got up at dawn. The weather was not bad.
She loosened up her body with light exercise, and was about to train with her persuaders, when she remembered that all of them were in safekeeping.
Reluctantly, she trained her combat skills more than usual.
She ate her breakfast and woke up Hermes after a while.
Kino’s body still felt light as she pushed Hermes out of the hotel. She was wearing her jacket, and the coat was rolled and securely tied on the carrier.
Several people were lined up out in the road. Kino was told that it could be relatively crowded in the mornings, and sometimes people have to wait in line for the cars.
Kino pushed Hermes and joined the queue. Then up front, a woman in her late-twenties spoke to Kino.
“Good morning. Are you a traveler?”
“Yeah. Good morning,” Kino returned the greeting, and the woman who was looking at Kino’s right thigh spoke with a slightly surprised face.
“Hey. Is that, by any chance, a persuader holster? I often see it in movies.”
“Oh, yeah. That’s right. However, all of my persuaders were locked up in a safety deposit box at the gate.”
The woman’s expression slightly darkened.
“You use a persuader, don't you?”
“Yup,” Kino nodded. The woman’s expression hardened, and then she spoke slowly.
“Hey, listen well. In this country, civilian possession of persuaders is completely prohibited by law.”
“So I heard.”
“Do you know why?”
To the woman’s question, Kino answered with, “No. I still haven’t heard this country’s history yet.”
And the woman said firmly while shaking her head,
“No, it has nothing to do with history at all. It’s simply because persuaders are very dangerous.”
Kino glanced at Hermes, and spoke to the woman.
“Dangerous, is it?” was her small response. The woman continued to talk as if lecturing a student.
“Yes. Persuaders are made for the sole purpose of shooting people and other living things. That’s why a person with a persuader will want to shoot other people. And they will get hurt. If everyone has a persuader, then everyone will want to shoot someone. Then as soon as tomorrow comes, there will be crimes involving persuaders here and there. Surely, there will be no such misfortunes if there were no persuaders. The truth is, people will be able to live happily, if only there were no weapons that can kill. ――Persuaders are very dangerous. Human lives are put in danger just because such a thing exists. That’s why in this country it is totally prohibited by law. Persuaders won’t do you any good, you know.”
Kino listened, nodding lightly. And then she spoke.
“In my case, there are unexpected situations I encounter during my travels, in which case, a persuader comes in handy.”
The woman’s expression remained dark.
“And probably in such times, you end up using persuader. You see, if both of you are holding persuaders, then your dispute will continue until either of you is dead. But, if you don’t have a persuader, your opponent will not think of killing you — because that is just so cruel. Also, there will be a chance for discussion. You will begin to explore more peaceful methods of resolving your differences.""
“It's like that, huh?” was Kino’s half-hearted reply, and the woman spoke with a dignified and unworried face.
“You coming to this country might be a coincidence, but think of it as a very good opportunity. Please do take time to learn this country’s wonderful concept of safety. Bye.”
While looking at the woman going away by car,
“I will,” Kino said indifferently.


Kino rode in a car and immediately ordered it to go to the country’s center. The display in front of the car flashed ‘To the country’s center’ and went off.
The car was running slowly just as before. They come to a complete stop in every intersection, and then pass through it in the same order they came in. No matter where it was moving, it maintained a reasonable distance from the other cars.
“This is so boring—. I’m going to fall asleep,” Hermes complained as the car stopped beside the road. The recording asked them to let in another passenger.
A middle-aged man, waiting in queue, went on board.
""Oh, how rare. It’s a traveler. Good morning.”
The man sat opposite Kino.
“Good morning.”
“How do you find riding our completely safe and free unattended public transportation system?”
“It certainly is comfortable and easy,” Kino said, and the man nodded approvingly.
“Right, right. This is one of our country’s prides. Thanks to it, anybody can go anywhere, in a safe, easy, and efficient manner. It is a must-have in a wide country such as ours.”
“Can this vehicle be driven on your own?” Kino asked casually. The man suddenly frowned.
“Drive? ――Did you just say ‘drive’? By that, do you mean to move this car by yourself?”
“Yes. I was wondering if there were people who wanted to drive it on their own. To go to the places they want to go to on their own.”
As Kino said this, the man’s face changed color.
“Driving is dangerous! For a human to operate a car.... That is such a dangerous thing!”
“Really?”
“Of course. A car has a large mass and runs at a high speed. That energy is comparable to that of a persuader bullet. You must imagine what would happen if you bump into a person?”
“Well, I guess so.”
“Humans aren't perfect living things. We make mistakes. There are some who think it’s fine if it’s just one person. ――But, mistakes will not be caused if there aren’t any people to commit them in the first place. And that is true for driving cars. Once we allow people to drive, for sure, someone somewhere will get into a car accident. Someone or something will get hurt, or killed even. That’s why in our country, driving of vehicles by civilians is completely prohibited by law. An era where people are allowed to drive vehicles is a barbaric one. Now you can automatically go to your destination safely, and with just one command, so thinking of driving a vehicle on your own..., just what are you thinking? Ah, that was rude of me. I’ve said too much. But, driving is...”
The man stopped the car and stood up.
“Miss traveler, please do not ever think of driving this thing on your own.”
The man who was about to get off left those words in a loud voice. Then a very old man came aboard and sat across Kino.
The car moved, and while looking out the window, the old man suddenly began to himself.
“Ah, driving.... Such a nostalgic word. When I was still young, you can sit behind the wheel and step on the accelerator pedal. However, during that time, tragic accidents that happen day in and day out were always taken for granted. In fact an uncle of mine got hit by a car while crossing a road, and was dead the next day. He was young, had a wife and kids. There were a lot of other tragic accidents; inexperienced youths driving too fast, failing to overtake a curve and running over a column of kindergartners, truck drivers looking away for a bit and crushing a car in front of them, and so on. Those people who make mistakes are no different from animals. For instance, even though there were firm rules and trafic signals, the people who created them couldn't obey the rules themselves. The vehicles can also be used for crimes. Criminals escaping by car compromise the safety of all the people around them.""
“I see,” Kino nodded suitably.
""A car is a tool for killing people. It is a truly frightening murder weapon. People had to be refrained from using cars. But now we can move about using these machines without a single risk. This is how it should have been right from the start. Ah, people would have lived longer.”
The old man was still gazing into the distance, speaking to himself.


Identical one-storey buildings were lined up at the center of the country. The streets were clean and well-maintained.
“Who said that this will be interesting? THese are just boring buildings,” Hermes complained.
“Where should we go this time?” Kino said, and as she began to push Hermes,
“You! Hey you there, wait!”
A voice raised from behind. It was a high-pitched female voice.
Kino turned around. A rather portly, middle-aged lady rushed wildly as she beckoned to Kino, and somehow managed to stop in front of her.
“I thought she was about to knock you down,” Hermes said in a small voice.
“By any chance, do you travel with this?”
The lady pointed her finger at Hermes, still in her high-pitched voice.
“Yeah. But here I’m not allowed to start the engi――”
“No way! Such a dangerous thing!”
The lady’s voice drowned Kino’s remark.
“I――”
“Motorrads are dangerous! Do you get it? Just think about it! Your body in such an unprotected state, in such a speed, just what do you think will happen if you fall down? You don’t have anything to protect body with!”
“That’s――”
“You! Life is very important! It’s a precious thing! So please stop riding motorrads! You cannot have your life back when you get in an accident! Don’t try risking your young life with riding something like a motorrad. Please stop while it’s not yet too late. Do you get it? Think of the sorrow you will cause your parents if you have an accident!”
“Yeah, but my――”
“It’s good that you understand! I just shared my concern for your safety! I hope you learn various things from this country. Bye.”
The lady rushed once more, and boarded a car.
After a while, Hermes spoke.
“Wow. This country might be more troublesome than we thought.”
Kino nodded.
“Now let’s go see the shops.”


Kino and Hermes rode a car and went to the shopping district.
In the middle of a large building was a passage, on both sides of which many stores were lined up. Kino walked through the passage, pushing Hermes along.
Kino found a hardware store and went inside. The interior was spacious, and pots were placed on a low shelf. She was greeted by a shopkeeper in his mid-thirties, sitting on the floor, working.
“Welcome, traveler. What would you be looking for?”
“Yes. I’m looking for a knife. One with a sharp, double-edged blade, longer than the palm of my hand. I couldn't find one anywhere.”
“What are you saying? Ah, didn't you know? In this country, bladed objects are completely prohibited by law.”
""Eh? It’s not available anywhere? At all? What about in other shops?” Hermes asked rather deliberately.
“Of course you won’t find any. Possession of bladed objects by civilians is strictly prohibited by law.”
“Why is that?” Kino asked the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper responded immediately.
“Why of course, it’s because bladed objects are dangerous, isn’t it?”
“Is that so?”
“Yes it is! Bladed objects are tools made for the sake of cutting and hurting people. People who want to have knives are people who do not know the value of life. They are a reserve army of murderers. We cannot allow such people to handle bladed objects. Societies which deem bladed objects as necessary for the lives of its citizens are indecent. This country’s excellent rules and regulations against knives are just so wonderful I can’t control my tears from flowing!”
The shopkeeper’s eyes blurred as he said this, and Kino asked.
“But, what do you use to sharpen pencils?”
“We use pencil sharpeners!” The shopkeeper immediately replied. Kino asked once more.
“But what about handicrafts? Ah, and cooking too.”
“Materials and food ingredients that are being sold here are already cut properly. After all, this is not a rural area. We have thoroughly trained professionals who do the cutting in, say, the butcher and fish shops. They are the only ones who need bladed objects as tools. Even these pros are not allowed to use the tools outside the workplace. The tools are stored properly in a safety deposit box. Knives in circulation among the general public.... Just the thought of it scares me. If ――”
Kino and Hermes waited for the next words of the shopkeeper.
“―― If such a country exists, then in that country, there must be frequent street killings using knives, right? If a desperate human were to obtain a kitchen knife from just any store, clutching it with both hands and slashing randomly at innocent bystanders in a street they thought safe and peaceful! ... Ah, it’s horrible to imagine. I’d hate to live in a country like that. Ah, so terrifying.... Scary.... Too frightening...”
“I see. I understand what you're saying. If you’ll excuse us.”
“Thanks.”
Kino and Hermes left the shop, with the shopkeeper holding his head in anguish.
Eventually, they walked through the shopping district devoid of people. After a little while, Kino muttered, “Nothing at all, huh?”
Hermes then spoke with a serious tone to Kino who seemed lost in wonder.
“I can understand a little how you feel. A long time ago, there was also a crazy guy who tried to kill Kino with a kitchen knife. ――A ‘devil out-of-place’, so to speak.”
""...‘Crazy guy with a blade’, you mean?” [1]
“Yeah, that.” Upon saying so, Hermes fell silent for a while.
And then pulled himself together, “Now, what will we do?”
“... Then let’s finish shopping for things that we really need,” Kino said while looking around.
“Kino. Didn’t you say that the strap of the bag came off?”
“Oh, that’s right. I need some strong glue.”


Kino approached some people and asked for the location of the general store.
As expected, the store she went into had low shelves. A middle-aged man who seemed to be the store manager greeted her.
""Welcome. Oh, a traveler, isn’t it? Welcome to our country, and welcome to my store. Are you looking for anything in particular?”
“Hello. Do you have instant glue, or anything similar?”
The store manager was slightly surprised, and immediately said carelessly.
“None. Is there a reason for something like that to exist?”
“None?” Hermes said, and the store manager put up his finger.
“This is a good chance to tell you. Ah—, ehem. In our country, civilian possession and use of instant glue is strictly prohibited by law.”
“....... Uh-huh, how come?” Kino asked, and Hermes murmured that she must have an idea why.
“Of course, it’s because instant glue is dangerous. See, what will you do if you cannot take it off from your finger? What if it gets in your eyes? What if a child swallows it? In all cases, the damage will be irreparable. Things that bring danger to the public have to be regulated by law. For that reason, if you want to have something repaired, you can use the glue we have right here.”
The store manager held out a glue in a colorful tube. Kino took it and examined it for a while.
“How long does this thing take to dry?”
“It’s fast. It takes only half a day.”
“......”
Kino returned the glue on top of the low desk.
“I’m sorry, but I think I’ll pass on the glue. Instead, do you have a strong thread and a big-eyed needle suitable for sewing leather?”
To Kino’s question, the store manager answered with, “We have threads, but only thin ones. By the way, all objects with tensile force above ten years are prohibited by law.”
“What do you mean by ‘tensile force above ten years’?” Kino asked, and the store manager explained.
“In this country, the weight of a typical ten-year old should break a string within three seconds.”
“And why is it prohibited?” Hermes asked.
“Isn't it obvious? It is to prevent suicide by hanging and death by strangulation. A tough string is a murder weapon, see.”
“......” “That’s the reason why they did not allow the rope.” Kino fell silent, and Hermes muttered.
“The shelf of yellow threads is over there. But we don’t have needles. Possession of needles by the public is prohibited by law.”
Kino nodded. “It’s probably dangerous because it can be used to stab. There is also the risk of the tip of the needle going to the lungs through the blood vessels.”
“Exactly. Oh, didn’t you know? Public possession of needles and other similarly pointed objects is completely prohibited by law. Compass tips and ball pen points should be the same sort as a fountain pen’s. Pencils whose tips are within 120 degrees are illegal, too.”
“......”
“However, needles are attached to sewing machines, and in such cases only the suppliers are allowed to remove the needles for each unit used. Possession of a sewing machine requires a license and for your current address to be listed, in order to identify each person to whom a unit has been sold. If your criminal record is clear, the product will be delivered within two weeks. After that, you will have to go to the police station to register the serial number of the needle.”
“Wha—. That’s so troublesome.” Hermes said in a disgusted tone.
“That is in order to establish the public's safety,” the manager said proudly. Kino asked.
“The sewing machines are allowed?”
“Yes. Possession of the sewing machine itself is allowed and anyone can have it. You just have to submit a resumé to the nearest police station, to prove that there are no problems with your medical certificate and that you have no prior criminal record. There’s a written test, and a practical test after a training course on the operation of an actual sewing machine. Once you pass these exams, you can have your permit to purchase a sewing machine and go straight to a shop to buy one. Once you buy the machine, you will have to go to the police station again to register the main body of the sewing machine. Then you will be required to have a locker and a key to store the sewing machine at home. You have to make sure that the locker can be secured somewhere in your house. If you have a family, you will also need to submit medical certificates and written consent from all of them. Then you will be able to use the sewing machine installed in your home. You can make anything you like, whether it be children's clothing or rag skirts. Then once a year, the police will come to check that the needle has not been removed or modified, and your registration will be updated. I have a study manual for sewing machine operations. Do you want one?”
As the store manager said this, he took out a book as thick as an encyclopedia from under his feet.
“No, thank you.... Excuse us for disturbing you.”


After lunch, Kino came to the lake shore. The sun was at its highest, and the lake was transparent and blue under it. Several streaks of clouds were visible on the horizon.
Kino stopped Hermes on the lawn and she squatted down.
“Hey there, miss traveler.”
A voice came from behind. Kino looked back, and a man took three steps towards her. He was around thirty, wearing glasses, and was wearing white clothes like that of a researcher.
“Hello. This is such a beautiful lake.” As Kino said this, the man laughed heartily.
“Isn’t it? Our ancestors chose this land because they wanted to have this view. In midsummer, this sandy beach gets filled with people who come to play.”
“Oh. You can swim here during the summer?” Kino asked happily. At the same time, the expression of the man darkened. He came two steps closer to Kino and in a cold tone different from earlier,
“Swimming? How ridiculous. Swimming is prohibited by law.”
“Prohibited?”
“Yes. I’m sure you don’t understand how terrifying water could be. Don’t you know? Humans can drown in shin-deep water.""
“But, swimming is fun,” Kino said, and the man sighed and took a big breath. He lifted his finger up and shook his head lightly.
“Fun..., huh. That ephemeral desire for pleasure results in an endless number of tragic deaths anywhere. The horrors of water-related accidents are taken too lightly. Anyway, in this country, citizens are prohibited to swim — whether in the river or in the lake. Well, if you are a little more aware of the value of life, you wouldn’t think of such a thing. But if you still want to swim no matter what, go ahead. I won’t stop you from committing suicide.”
“O...kay...”
After her half-hearted reply, “Oh! ――By any chance, are bathtubs banned for the same reason?”
“That’s right. Those used for infants are a special case, and require permission to be used, but other than that, all other equipment similar to bathtubs are strictly prohibited. There is always the risk of small children and old people dying from drowning. I have heard stories of countries having such a dangerous thing installed in their homes. But if people from those countries were to come here, they will realize how immature their culture is. I want them to come and learn how real advanced countries do things.”
“Is that right?”
“Yes. That’s why travelers are in luck. You can share our country’s splendid ways to your own country once you go home. You can tell everything you’ve seen here without hesitation. I’m sure everyone will be surprised. By the way, motorrads are really dangerous, so you’d better stop riding them. Bye.”
The man walked away, and Hermes asked, “Now what? Are we going back to the hotel?”
“It's also nice to take a nap here.""
“Isn’t it a bit chilly? You’ll catch a cold.”
“I see.... So taking a nap is also dangerous.”


In the hotel lobby low shelves and expectedly low sofas were lined up.
A circular water tank was affixed on top of the shelf. Its upper portion was spread out in folds, and has the shape like that of a fat tulip.
A number of goldfish were swimming inside. There were red and white speckled types, as well as weird ones with bulging eyes.
Kino was squatting to look at the aquarium, and then a hotel boy who happened to pass by spoke.
“Aren’t they cute? These are the pets this hotel is so proud of. Right now, goldfish are the most popular pets in this country.”
And then he pointed at the type with bulging eyes.
“We have a shortage of this particular type, and breeders are reaping a profit from them.”
“Eh. Aren’t there any other pets around? For instance, dogs,” Kino asked. The boy was slightly surprised, and then with a calm tone,
“There are no dogs here. In our country, keeping a dog is prohibited by law.”
“Prohibited, is it?” Kino asked as she stood up.
“Yes. What would you do if you get bitten by those scary teeth? A human will have a serious injury in no time. In the worst case, you might even get killed. I can’t imagine a world where such dangerous animals like dogs aren’t prohibited. It’s common sense. Only animals which can do absolutely no harm to humans can be kept as pets.”
“That is to say, only the ones allowed by law can be kept as pets?”
The boy nodded, then said afterwards, ""Goldfish, small fish, and adult fish not exceeding twenty centimeters, as well as sea monkeys [2]―― have you heard of those? Then later on, freshwater jellyfish were also allowed. They’re all cute.""
“Is that all? What about carp?”
“Carp? Carps are dangerous. You’ll have to have a pond built to keep some. What would happen if a child falls into it?”
“What about cats?” Hermes asked.
“Why of course, cats are no good either. If you were scratched by those claws and catch tetanus what would you do?”
""And small birds?” Kino asked.
“They were allowed until three years ago. But people found out that dust from the feathers entering your windpipe is bad, and since then they have been completely regulated. Those who have been keeping them as pets at the time were required to surrender them.""
“Turtles?” Hermes asked.
“Anything with bite force exceeding 0.5 pencil is not allowed. Such as snapping turtles.”
“What do you mean by ‘0.5 pencil’?”
“It’s a measurement of bite force. One pencil is the force required to break a pencil in one minute. That means, if a bite can break a pencil within thirty seconds, it is not allowed.”
“What a stringent check,” Hermes said.
The boy expanded his chest, and said proudly, “All of these are for the safety of human lives,” he said with a radiant smile.
Kino called out to the boy who was about to leave.
“I have one more question. Why is it that the shelves are low anywhere you go?”
""Because it’s dangerous if an object falls from a high place. In this country, the maximum height for a shelf is the average height of a baby that can walk. Building shelves higher than that is prohibited by law. That’s why the rooms are very spacious. Thanks to this law, there are absolutely zero human casualties due to falling objects. The country guarantees the safety of its citizens. Oh, that’s it!”
The boy pointed to a corner of the lobby, where a low bookshelf lined from end to end with thick books was placed. There were about fifty books.
“Over there are this year’s latest editions of our law books. If you so wish, you can read them and make them as a reference for your own country’s laws. We wouldn’t mind at all.”


The next day.
As usual, Kino got up at the crack of dawn. She moved her body a bit to relax.
She quickly ate her breakfast, tapped Hermes awake and departed immediately to avoid the morning rush. As there were no other customers in the car, it was a bit shaky for a while until they arrived at the western gate.
The young inspector in his twenties was waiting by the window in the outer walls. Kino saw him and the carriage containing the deposit box right next to him.
“Here. We are grateful for your cooperation.”
Kino first placed the small objects in her bag. Then, she put the knives back in place. The inspector looked on curiously.
Kino took out the pieces of her persuaders, and quickly reassembled them. The inspector who did not run away this time, was gazing at her work.
She then returned ‘Canon’ and ‘Woodsman’ in their holsters. Kino jumped lightly as if confirming the weight.
“As I thought, I feel calmer. It feels as if I lost an arm and it grew back,” Kino said.
The inspector who was silently looking on from the beginning then talked to Kino.
“Hey, miss traveler. Just for a moment. I want to talk to you. ――There’s something I want you to listen to.”
“What is it?” Kino turned around and asked. The young inspector hesitated for a bit.
“I have not told this to anyone else in the country but.... Having this sort of job, I often have a chance to speak to travelers like you. It might be that..., the way of thinking of everyone in this country, that is, regulating everything that is considered dangerous, is somewhat wrong. I’ve been feeling this way for some time...”
“What do you mean? Kino asked. The inspector spoke slowly, in a cautious tone.
“... It’s just that, motorrads, knives, persuaders, cars, instant glue; these are mere ‘objects’.... I don’t know how to say it. I have a feeling that, it depends on the people who uses it, that is to say, a thing becomes either dangerous or not, depending on the way we use it. In other words...”
“Please continue,” Kino said. The inspector looked ahead of Kino.
“In other words, I'm starting to wonder whether the real danger comes from humans. To be precise, human will. It doesn’t mean that things which are considered dangerous and can potentially hurt people are objects that have a will to move freely and attack humans. I think it’s more like somebody used it to intentionally hurt people, or due to lack of knowledge and experience, used it far from its purpose and hurt himself and others as a result. There’s no such thing as a ‘dangerous object’, rather, there are only ‘dangerous humans’, don’t you think? Wouldn't it be better to have people who are well-trained in the correct way of using these objects, as well as in the morals and rules of using them? Instead of not letting people have a dangerous object, shouldn’t we just nurture people that are able to recognize the risks of using them? We ought to increase the number of such people. And I feel that if such people were to acquire the skill to use these various things properly, they will find these objects as more convenient or more fun to use. And I think that there’s a potential for life to be more fulfilling and enjoyable. Of course, there’s always the risk. But if we put them in a balance, I think the potentials would outweigh the risks way way more.”
And then the inspector shook his head, confirming that nobody was around. Even so, with a considerably small voice, he asked Kino.
“Hey, miss traveler. You have knives, persuaders, and a motorrad. In fact, you use them. That’s why I want you to tell me..., uhm, these thoughts I’m having, are they wrong? If in this country, I’m the only one who have such ideas, then maybe there’s something wrong with my head. I want to know the truth. I feel that, if it comes from a traveler, I’d definitely find the answer to my question.”
Kino was earnest all the while, never once shifting her gaze from the serious face of the inspector. She thought for a while.
And then,
“I’ll give you an honest answer. The answer to your question is, ‘Yes’. ――There must be something wrong with your head,” Kino said. The inspector’s eyes opened wide in surprise,
“Ah.... No, but...” and was tongue-tied.
Kino continued.
“The people of this country firmly believe in the importance of living safely, and made a variety of wonderful laws for that purpose.”
“Eh? But...”
“Thanks to that everyone can live safely. And happily. Do you think the people of this country are suffering and grieving in inconvenience and misfortune?”
“......”
“I also want to live safely if I can. That’s why I think this country is a very wonderful place. And, if you think a country is wrong for wanting to be safe, then, there is definitely something wrong with you. It’s a good thing you haven’t said that to anybody else yet.”
“....... I-is that so?”
“Yes. That’s why you have to be more confident of your country’s ways, and live in this country with pride,” Kino declared. He looked at her.
“Is that so...” The inspector muttered, dropping his shoulders.
“We’ll be going then.”
Kino started Hermes’ engine. The engine’s roar bounced off the walls.
“Ah, thank you.... Please take care...,” the inspector said.
“'You take care’,” [3] Kino said. She faced forward, strapped her goggles on, and launched Hermes off.
“....Is that so.”
The inspector was staring blankly at the running motorrad.


“It’s been a long time. I feel so good,” Kino said while riding.
Kino and Hermes were riding at a considerable speed along the lakeside road. To the right was the flowing forest, and to the left was the sun, which was reflected radiantly on the surface of the lake up to the horizon.
“I agree. As I thought, a motorrad running using its own engine is much better. Being carried by the tires of another vehicle somehow felt wrong.” Hermes said happily as well. Kino purposely let the rear wheel slide when they reached a curve, and small stones came flying out of the road.
“Hey, Kino,” Hermes asked.
“Hmm?”
“That inspector’s way of thinking was exactly the same as Master’s teachings, wasn't it?”
Kino’s expression softened underneath the goggles.
“That’s right. It felt so nostalgic, listening to him.”
“I knew it. So it was on purpose. But why?”
To Hermes’ question,
“For his safety,” Kino answered. “If they can get rid of dangerous things, what more of a dangerous person?”
“Yup. In each person, there’s always that instinct to live safely.”
Kino stepped on the brakes, and let Hermes’ speed drop.
“Maybe.”
They avoided a large stone lying in the middle of the road.
And accelerated.















"
73,v10c7,10,7,"In a lush deep green forest, where lakes reflect the blue sky in its clear water, there was one country.
Inside this vast country, buildings were lined up with roads of various sizes laid out in between like spider webs.
At the western part of the country, by the walls, there was a gate. Beside the gate, a room was provided to deal with emigration procedures.
A single motorrad (Note: A two-wheeled vehicle. Only to note that it cannot fly) was parked a little distance away from the room, in a place designated as a rotary square. It was a motorrad loaded with traveling luggage on top and on both sides of its rear wheel.
A person was leaning on the motorrad. It was the driver, who was wearing a black jacket, a belt tightened on the waist and a hand persuader (Note: A persuader is a gun. In this case, a pistol) suspended from her right thigh. She was around mid-teens in age, with short black hair, big eyes and an intrepid expression. She was wearing a brimmed hat with goggles strapped around it.
There was nobody else in the square. Several birds were hopping around looking for food. The sun just above the eastern wall warmed the driver’s back, and only its long shadow fell within the gates.
“Not yet? Kino,” asked the motorrad.
“Not yet. Not a minute has passed since you asked that, Hermes,” the driver called Kino answered.
A cleaning vehicle came, noisily rattling by the road.
The cleaning vehicle drove off the birds, dampened the wide road beside the square, and went away.
When the shadow became a little shorter,
“Not yet?” Once again, the motorrad called Hermes asked.
“Not yet,” was Kino’s short answer. Soon after the reply, the door of the room beside the gates opened.
“Hmm? I wonder if it’s finished?” Hermes said, as a man came out of the room.
The man was about in his mid-thirties. For easy movement outdoors, he was wearing clothes which seem sturdy but easy to move in and a vest with several pockets for carrying various things. A rifle-type persuader hung on his back.
It was a military rifle with a body made of plastic, and with a sniper’s scope with built-in night-vision and laser sight attached to it.
The man noticed Kino and Hermes, walked a few steps closer and gave them a morning greeting. Kino raised herself from Hermes and returned the greeting.
“Were you lined up for departure procedures? I’m sorry but there’s one more person inside. It will take a little more time. The document screening is quite cumbersome,” said the man.
“You are a citizen of this country? Going out on a journey?” Hermes asked.
“Yeah..., that’s right,” the man answered, his expression darkening a little.
Without the slightest ceremony, Hermes continued, “But then, not a single one came to say goodbye? People here sure are cold.”
“That was harsh...” The man answered with a sour expression, and turned once to the room where he came out. The door was closed.
“Must be some complicated matter, huh?” Kino said. ‘Sort of’, the man nodded.
“I couldn't tell this to anyone, but... if it’s outsiders like you, then I guess it’s fine. I don't mind sharing this story with another person. It’s good for passing time while waiting. Would you like to listen? As to why I am going out on a journey?” The man asked, looking straight at Kino.
Kino raised the brim of her hat a little. “Sure, go ahead.”
The man’s expression darkened a little, and then he let out a light laugh. As a preface, he said,
""It’s to obtain forgiveness. At any cost.""


“To obtain forgiveness?” “What do you mean?” Kino and Hermes asked.
The man’s mouth changed from a smile to one full of bitterness.
“I myself think that it’s a strange reason.... But, it’s important.... To me it’s important...”
There was silence for a few seconds, and then Hermes asked, “That’s it?”
“Ah, no—. Where should I begin? The one who will go with me on this journey is the one undergoing emigration procedures right now, a woman.”
“A partner?”
“Yeah, sort of.... That person invited me to this journey.... I would travel with her to protect her in case she gets into trouble. And..., as to why...”
The man spoke in a gentle tone, “A long time ago, I killed her lover.”
“......” “Huh?”
“It was seven years ago. I did not know her at all that time. I made a mistake.... It was illegal to drive a car after drinking alcohol, but I insisted; my attention and cognition have dropped.... I was driving too fast, and wasn’t able to make a turn at the intersection...”
“Uh-huh, and then?”
“And then..., I hit a house.... That was not all. A person who was walking down the sidewalk got caught between the car and the house. In any case, I killed an innocent person...”
The man looked up at the dazzling morning sun, and breathed thin air.
“Then, I was arrested and taken into court.... At that time, the woman I told you about, that man’s lover, confronted me. ‘Murderer! Give him back!’ she said. It was natural.... That’s the only thing she can do.... That's how we first met...”
The man dropped his shoulders slightly, and Hermes spoke. “This story to kill time turned out to be quite a baby talk, huh?”
“... Heavy talk?”
“Yeah, that,” Hermes said and fell silent.
Kino asked, “I see. And then, what did you do?”
“It was decided that I will serve 10 years in prison, and I was sent to the prison for traffic offenders. I lost my work, my life, everything. Well, both of my parents were dead, and I was not married, so there was only a few who were sad for me.”
“The figures don't add up. Did you escape from jail?” Hermes said happily, and the man shook his head with a smile.
“I’m not finished yet. While in prison, I truly repented for what I did. And then, I sent her a letter. It contained my sincerest apologies. I wrote my honest feelings; that I wanted to do anything to atone for my sin.
“Uh-huh. And then?”
“And then, there was no reply at all. Even so, I continued to send out a letter every month. Even if only a little, I wanted her to know my sympathy for her loss, and my willingness to atone for my sin. I always send it together with a small amount of money that I receive from the prison.”
The man looked back one more time. The door of the room, illuminated by the bright morning sun, was still closed.
“Six years passed. I was already quite accustomed with life in prison, and I have forgotten how a normal and free life felt like. At that time, all of a sudden, she came to visit me for the first time. I was surprised. Very surprised.... I looked at her through the glass; looked at the mountain of opened letters she was holding... and I apologized to her in tears. Just knowing that she actually read the letters made me very happy. But that’s not all. She asked me to lift up my face, and made a proposal that I would never have expected.”
“To get out of the country, right?” Kino said in confirmation.
“Yes. ——She said she wanted to get out of this country because there were painful memories here. She wanted to go to a different country and start a new life. She asked me to come with her because she needed a bodyguard. I only have less than five years to serve in prison, and it seemed that it was possible for me to leave the country on one condition — that I am banned from entering it ever again. It was a loophole in an old law. More than this, I was surprised and asked her, ‘You would want me to come with you, but aren't you bearing resentment against me?’”
“So?” “And then?”
“She then said this: ‘I still have grudge and hate against you. But, you promised in your letters that you would do anything to atone for your sin. And so——'”
“What did you do?”
“I suffered. I suffered so much. After four years, I can finally get out of jail. However, it never crossed my mind that I had to go on a journey and leave my beloved homeland for eternity. In this country where I was born and raised and where my dead parents rest — I would have chosen to die and be buried here as well. I thought, after I got released from prison, that I would do my best to start my life over again. But——”
“But?”
“I thought this was the only way to atone for my sin.... Above all, she herself wanted to do it this way. I agonized over her proposal for about a year, before I decided to accept it. To never again return to this country, to become her escort to a journey that may continue for who knows how long. I told her this the next time she came to visit. I cannot describe how I felt when she said ‘Thank you’ to me with a gentle smile.”
The man then held back the tears which suddenly came to his eyes. He excused himself for a while and turned away from Kino.
“I suppose this will be the last time I get to cry in this country,” said the man in a low voice.
The door of the room was still closed. After some time has passed, the man looked up at the sky once more.
The man turned to Kino and Hermes.
“‘Not yet,’ I thought,” said the man.
“I think she hasn’t forgiven me yet. That’s why I would like to atone for what i did. I don’t know what sort of places we will go to, but I’m sure it will be a long journey. But this is not my journey, it’s hers. And I’d like to think of this as my life’s journey.... It starts from here on.”
“I see. I understand it very well,” Kino said to the man who seemed like he’s going to cry once more.
“Well, each person’s life is different from another’s. Yup, it’s quite interesting,” said Hermes.
The man laughed a bit and faced Kino, “Thank you for listening. As my senior in traveling, is it okay if I ask you a question?”
“What would that be?”
“In traveling, what’s the thing that I should be most careful of?”
“That’s simple. It’s the same as what you should do if you were living a normal life in a country,” answered Kino immediately.
“What?”
“To not lose your life. Or, to not get killed. In other words, to do everything that you can to protect your own life. ——If you want to be more specific, to kill before you get killed.”
“... I understand...”
The door of the room opened.


There was the woman who was about the same age and wearing similar clothes as the man, with a small hand persuader hanging by her waist. She smiled happily as the man introduced Kino to her.
She learned that Kino would be going in the same direction. ‘That’s a pity, if we were going by car, we could travel together,’ she said regretfully.
“But I have a very reliable escort,” the woman said with a smile. Then, she saw the slightly sad expression of the man, faced him and smiled.
“Hey, Miss Kino. If you finish with the procedures and catch up with us, let’s eat lunch together. I think we'll take a rest by the lake.”
Upon being told this, Kino replied sincerely, “That would be nice.”
A horse laden with luggage was waiting outside.
“Well, let’s go,” she said, and the other person slowly nodded.
The two passed through the gates.


“Grab what you can, when you can. [2] I’ll try to catch up by noon,” Kino said, while pushing along Hermes to the room by the gate.
“Kino is so greedy,” said Hermes.
“Whatever,” said Kino.
It was just before lunch when Kino and Hermes finished the procedures.


In the forest, there was a road. The road was wide enough for a car to run in comfortably.
Kino was riding Hermes at a considerable speed.
The wall of trees continued to flow on both sides of the road, and the beautiful blue hue of the lake occasionally appeared in and out of view. The sun was high up in the sky, spilling light in the gaps between the leaves and branches.
“Let’s exit through that curve ahead,” said Hermes, and Kino released the gas pedal.
As they exited through the not so visible curve ahead, they came upon the sandy shore of the lake on the left side of the road. Over there, two horses were tethered together, and two persons were sitting by taking a rest.
Kino dropped the gear. As she approached, the man with the rifle waved at her.
Kino stopped Hermes some distance away from the two, and pushed down the stand. While walking, she removed her goggles and hung it around her neck.
“Hello. I caught up.”
The man put down his cup and stood up,
“A motorrad is fast, after all. We just settled down here for tea.”
Having his back to the woman, he made two steps towards Kino.
The woman pulled out the small hand persuader from her waist, and stood up slowly. She held the persuader in both hands and aimed it towards the back of the man right before her.
Bang.
She fired. The empty cartridge flew, and the bullet opened a hole in the man’s shoulder. Kino backed away in one jump.
“Guh!” The man raised a cry, his body bent.
Bang.
A second bullet was fired, hitting the man’s right thigh.
Bang.
A third bullet hit the left thigh.
The man soon lost his balance, and the rifle on his back was trapped underneath his fallen body.
The woman trotted towards the barrel of the rifle and stepped on it. And immediately, she fired on the man below, one bullet to the right arm, one bullet to the left arm, fired in quick succession.
Bang bang.
“Gyaah!” The man cried in reflex for each shot.
The woman pulled out and picked up the man’s rifle. She slung it on her back.
Being shot in several places, the man was lying face up on the ground, drenching it with a large amount of blood. With a surprised and vacant look on his face, he asked the woman who stood by side, looking down at him,
“Ah..., Why...? What...?”
The woman spoke calmly, without batting an eyelid. “I just shot you. Does it hurt?”
The man gave a small nod.
The woman nodded once, and asked Kino, who already backed away to Hermes’ side, “Miss Kino. Would you shoot me to help him?”
Kino, whose hand was outstretched towards ‘Canon’ in her right thigh, quietly shook her head.
The woman returned her gaze to the man.
“W-why...?”
Greasy sweat surfaced on the man’s face, along with pain, doubt and fear.
“Why I fired at you——, is that it?”
The man nodded, his eyes still wide open.
“Of course, it’s to kill you.”
“W-why?”
“Because I can’t forgive you. Because you killed the most important person to me. I can’t forgive you.”
“......”
“That’s not all. Those letters you sent every month. You wrote so many words of apology: ‘I hope you somehow forgive me. I truly pray for his happiness in the afterlife.' As far as I’m concerned, those were nothing but selfish words. ——No, there are probably people willing to forgive in this world. Receiving a letter of repentance from a sinner, ‘Ah, this person is also suffering. He is also a victim like me’ ——I suppose there are people who think so. Probably, these people think ‘What’s done is done, there’s nothing else we can do’. These people suffice for an ‘I was mistaken’. Well, I am different. The grief it caused me, when you stole him away, just got bigger over time. It got worse every time I receive one of your letters. Each time I saw them, I was reminded that his killer is still living a carefree life. It made me suffer, I wasn’t able to forgive..., and it hardened my resolve to take my revenge on you.”
Blood slowly drained away from the man’s face, and he can no longer move.
“Hey——” The woman’s face did not change expression, and she continued to speak.
“This is what I think. When you appealed to the feelings of victim's family, saying ‘I've reflected on what I've done,' the only thing you could think of was ‘I said good things, so I will be saved’, am i right? You were pleasing no one but yourself! Above all, what were you doing while I was suffering and in despair? You were safe in prison, living an orderly life, without having to fear going hungry or getting cold. And after ten years, you will be able to live openly as a free man, and live your life without anything to worry about anymore! You, a murderer, laughing and walking the streets with your lover——! You think something like that can be forgiven? I won’t allow it.”
The man opened his mouth, “B-but...”
Bang.
The woman fired at the man’s ear. The earlobe was torn, but the amount of blood which began to flow from it was nothing compared to his other wounds.
“Listen until I finish my story. ——And so I decided to take my revenge. I will lure you out of the country, to a place where the country’s laws cannot be enforced. I will kill you with my own hands, on behalf of that man. That was my plan. For that, I prepared for everything I need. So that I can appear before you with a calm demeanor, I trained myself to kill my emotions. I also practiced how to smile gently. ――And then, I worked desperately to be able to earn money for a journey. Even though I hated it, and would never have thought of touching one my whole life, I bought a persuader. I bought it with the money you sent me. After a while, I also trained my shooting skills to make sure that I can kill you when the time comes. I learned how to shoot in a way that will hurt the most. So? My plan worked rather well, don't you think? Were you listening?”
The woman peered over the face of the man.
The man was still lying on his back. Tears flowed down his temples from his unblinking eyes.
“No...” He muttered in a small voice.
“No... Not like this.... No..., I don’t want to die... in a place like this... No..., I want to go back to my country.... I don’t want to die...”
“I’m sure he thought that way, too,” said the woman. Then she secured the safety of the hand persuader and returned it to its holster. She turned, and raised the man’s rifle. She skillfully released the safety, and stood by the feet of the man sprawled on the ground.
She poised the rifle by her waist, switched on the laser sight of the scope, and aimed the tiny red dot of light at the man’s jaw.
“Please... f-forgive me...” The man muttered, moving his pale lips a little.
The woman, with a very satisfied expression, nodded several times, and showed her gentle smile.
“Yes. The truth is I really wanted to forgive you. I wanted to forgive you all along. You wrote, ‘I'll do anything to atone for my sin’. That’s why I’m ending your life. ——The earlier I end your suffering, the better, don’t you think?”
She fired.
For each shot, the woman’s body gets pushed back a little in recoil. She continued to shoot amidst the recoil.


In a lush deep green forest, where a lake reflects the blue sky in its clear water, there stood two humans.
Beside two horses tethered together, there was a motorrad, ——and a headless human stretched out on his back.
The woman crouched slowly, and placed the empty rifle on the ground.
Her expression was now as clear as the sky. Her face looked happy.
“Yes...” The woman spoke to the man.
“Finally, I can forgive you. Listen well. I forgive you. That’s what you wanted right? That’s what you wished from the bottom of your heart, wasn’t it? That wish, I now grant it to you. You are forgiven. Hey, listen, ——I forgive you.”


There was a fresh mound by the shore. A rifle was pierced on it as a grave marker.
In front of it, the woman was kneeling down, hands clasped in front of her face, praying.
Before long she stood up, turned, and asked the person behind her.
“Miss Kino, you could have shot me if you wanted. Why?”
“Because I’m not a God. That’s all.”
“Yup. Kino is Kino,” said Hermes.
“I see. ——Thank you for helping me make a grave.”
“You’re welcome.”


The woman approached the man’s horse, with all of its harness removed, and gently spoke to it. “Now you can go to a place you like. Living freely in the forest is okay; living for someone back in the gates is also good.”
Then she tapped the horse lightly. The surprised horse moved forward a little, looked back once, and then disappeared into the forest.
“So, what will you do after this?” Kino asked the woman.
“My journey is already over, so I will go back to the country. I intend to live with his memories until I die.”
“I see. Take care.”
“Thank you. Ah, sorry I couldn’t join you for lunch.”
“It’s okay.”
The woman collected her luggage, those which were not buried, and fastened them to her horse. Then she lightly straddled the horse, and waved with a smile,
“Goodbye”
The horse carrying the woman disappeared on the other side of the trees by the curve.


“Phew...” Kino breathed.
“Really, things happened just as you said, Kino. I was a little surprised, but I’m quite impressed,” Hermes said happily.
“I suppose so.... Now, let’s grab what we can, while we can.”
“Kino is so greedy,” said Hermes.
“Whatever...” said Kino.


On the shore where the motorrad ran, there was a fresh mound.
There, a rifle was pierced as a grave marker.
It was a military rifle with a body made of plastic, but the scope was no longer attached.















"
74,v10c8,10,8,"My name is Riku. I'm a dog.
I have long, white, bushy fur. I always look happy and smiling, but it doesn’t mean that I am. I’m just born this way.
Shizu is my master.


We were riding in a buggy through a snowy plain.
Master Shizu was wearing a parka over his usual green sweater, and colored goggles. I was sitting in the passenger seat and looking forward.
The snow accumulated during the winter was somewhat melted, and it sagged when stepped on, so it wasn't scratching the body of the buggy. The flat white space covered in ashen clouds was stretching as far as the eye can see. The morning sun wasn't visible.
The buggy was running on the snow surface that was supposed to be a road. However, the engine in the back of the car was in bad condition. From time to time it wasn't spinning that well, but then it was puffing out black smoke and it seems that it would just stop.
Master Shizu was pressing the clutch and changing gears in confusion, he was using every trick he knew to prevent the engine from stopping. Then, breathing out a white fog, he said:
""It indeed needs proper maintenance.""
The buggy was heading north, pushing through the thick snow with its front wheels and squeezing back the ground with chains attached to the rear wheels.
Around noon, the brown wall appeared on the horizon. A big country was emerging from the sea of white, like an island.


The country was encircled by high walls made of brown bricks. The old towers were lined up above it at surprisingly regular intervals.
Master Shizu asked for an entry permit near the grandiose gate. The guard standing there asked how long we were going to stay in the country.
Master Shizu answered frankly that he doesn't know, but the less the better.
""Until we repair the buggy. If we have any plans after that, we won't stay long.""
Since our departure date was unknown, the guard offered to give us permission to stay in country for ten days tops. Master Shizu agreed.
We entered the country in our buggy which was dirty with mud.
The country we've finally came into was rich and technologically advanced.
A number of luxurious housing complexes with greenery on verandas were standing on both sides of the road with a lot of traffic. Sophistically designed streetlights and trees were lined along the streets. People in fine clothes, who seem to be quite wealthy, were curiously gazing at us from the sidewalks.
The car repair shop we were told about was located farther from the residential area, and closer to the country's center. The buggy's engine was examined there without delay.
After diagnosis, we were told that they don't know how much time it will take to make the proper repairs. The worn-out parts of the engine had to be replaced. If they had such parts at the nearby warehouse, then everything will be ready in the morning. Otherwise they had to manufacture it, so it will take two or three days. Master Shizu left the buggy in the repair shop and asked for a contact address.
He took out a big black cloth bag from the buggy and walked in the street. Near a big hotel we were told about, he said:
""It doesn't suit me. I don’t like it.""
And turned his back to this gorgeous glass-sided building.
Standing at the intersection, he said that he would prefer a much cheaper place to stay, and looked over the streets.
In contrast to the tall buildings at the south side of the country that were standing in lines in an orderly way, the low-rise houses at the north side were jumbled up. Master Shizu headed north.
Soon the scenery started to change, and even for mere politeness it could not be described as pretty.
The snow was still lying on the shoulders of the narrow road, the houses were small and narrow with lots of laundry drying at the rooftops.
In the cold air, Master Shizu walked on a relatively empty street with a vacant look on his face. Then suddenly, someone asked him from behind in a forceful tone, ""Where are you going?"" 
He turned around and saw a middle-aged police officer. He was slightly surprised when he saw Master Shizu.
""What? Are you a traveler? I wouldn't recommend you to be in such a place.""
He told us that further north, the poorest people of the country were living, and one could call the place a slum. And added, ""They are the lowest level in our country's class system.""
""I see. They have a different social position,"" Master Shizu.
""So mister traveler prefers a principle of absolute equality,"" asked the officer.
""Yes.""
""If your position is different, it's OK—— But you know what? Sometimes there are people who enter our country and then greatly protest against our class system. Well, this is cruel and we can't permit it. The roots of our principles go far into the past. And so we don't want to be taught how to live by outsiders.""
""I understand. But I don't have any interest in your lifestyle. It's just that high-class places don’t fit me, so I am looking for a cheap one.""
""You are weird, but do as you like—— However, those who live straight ahead are poor and filthy ones. This place is full of people who almost don't do any work, and earn their living by selling blood and internal organs and by robbing. I want to warn you that it's unsafe in there.""
""Blood and internal organs, huh? ... There's no doubt they are making good money.""
""Well, taking out organs from a living person is prohibited, but the clients are wealthy people so there's no control over it.""
""I see. And what about artificial organs?""
""They exist, but you can't live long with them, since they're not the real thing. That's why these are highly priced. Therefore, there are people who make money and there are ones who are able to live long. Mister traveler, please try not to get robbed of your entrails.""
Master Shizu thanked the officer, who then left after talking to the traveler and satisfying his curiosity.
The farther Master Shizu went, the more ruined and dirty the streets became. It was hard to believe that this area and the one to the south belonged to the same country.
When he noticed a narrow alley and realized that there were many people in there, he entered it without much agonizing.
Brown houses were standing on both sides of the pavement wet in lingering snow, causing a feeling of oppression. The plaster of the houses was peeling off, the bricks were chipped and crumbled.
The shops without eaves were visible here and there; it seemed they were almost out of business.
In front of a house, a girl was sitting doing nothing, and a man was warming by a fire made in a drum can although it was still noon. Walking along these streets, we were attracting people's attention. Children with dirty bare feet were staring at us.
Shortly, a group of young people stood before Master Shizu. Judging by their looks, they probably didn't have a job, but had too much free time and power. They blocked the way and glared at him.—— What happened next was exactly what I expected.
After Master Shizu asked for a cheap hotel without changing his facial expression, they attacked him. He beat them all into the ground. At an unsafe place, the first thing you should do is to show your strength. As a result, after that the number of unnecessary situations decreases.
Master Shizu asked the same question once again, and this time the young fellows kindly guided us to a hotel. It was located on a relatively crowded, squalid street. The hotel rented rooms on the upper floors of an eating place. The small room we were guided to had a bed and a chair, and was heated with a small electric heater.
""I like it,"" he said briefly to the hostess.


Master Shizu returned to the room in the evening. He said that the owner of repair shop was appalled by the hotel we stayed at.
He opened the cloth bag and took out a black sheath containing his favorite katana. He pulled it out from the sheath. There was not a single tarnish on it.
Then he put it back in the sheath.
""Please, let's have this talk one more time,"" I started the conversation.
""Are you really intending to go there?""
I asked the same question I asked many times before.
The answer Master Shizu gave to me was the same as always.
Then we've talked about it as we did many times already.
The result of this conversation didn't change a bit.
I took a breath and laid beside the bed, then we heard a knock at the door. I felt the presence of someone in the corridor.
Master Shizu stood up, made several steps towards the door and opened it slowly.
A young girl was standing there.
She seemed to be twelve. She had her black hair in two braids down either side of her head. She was wearing a layered purple one-piece dress typical of this country, but similar to other people around here, it was a little dirty. Her shoes were battered and full of holes.
""What do you want?"" Master Shizu asked, slightly surprised.
The girl looked up and stared at him for several seconds. She was no taller than his chest. Then she showed a basket she was carrying on her back, and said in a not so loud voice:
""I am collecting scrap metal to sell. Do you have some?""
He shook his head.
""I've got an annoying dog. Do you want it?""
""Master Shizu, that's going too far,"" I objected from behind.
""I'm joking.""
And then he said to the girl standing at the door:
""I don't have any, since we just arrived here.""
""OK...""
The girl said, ""Excuse me,"" and bowed.
Master Shizu closed the door. Through the crack in the door I saw that girl raise her head. She was looking at me. And then I noticed an unusual expression in her eyes.
Her intense piercing eyes were blazing, hiding some big determination.
These eyes didn't fit the slightly dirty face of the girl struggling against poverty and exhaustion from labor.


The next morning.
Master Shizu and I were having breakfast at the restaurant on the first floor. Master Shizu was putting the pieces of bread into his mouth, while I was sitting on the floor beside my share, waiting for him to finish. Outside, the people were coming and going, and the streets seemed crowded in its own way. The sun appeared on the sky, lighting and warming the streets.
The girl we've met yesterday barged in the dining room and noticed us.
She turned to Master Shizu who has eaten the bread and started drinking bean soup.
""Good Morning, Mr. Shizu!""
With the light from the outside shining on her back, she said this in loud cheerful voice, completely different from the one we heard yesterday. Master Shizu stopped eating and turned to her.
""My name is Rafa!"" the girl introduced herself, and then continued:
""Mr. Shizu. please buy me!""
""Wha—,"" Master Shizu said in a voice full of surprise.
""Please buy me! If you do, then I will work for you!""
Rafa repeated this joyfully with a smile on her face.
Master Shizu stared curiously at Rafa for a while, then the girl approached us without hesitation and stood beside him.
""I don't understand what you mean,"" he said.
""I'll explain! If you pay me, I’ll become your property, then we leave the country and will travel together. I'll become your servant and will work for you as hard as I can.""
""——I don't need a servant.""
Saying just this, Master Shizu hastened his breakfast. Rafa continued, ignoring his words:
""I'll tell you the reason why. I want to leave this country. In here the people of lowest class like me are very poor. I have to work, so I'm not able to go to school. I'm done with it. I'm fed up with such a life. That's why I want to get out of here. But I can't because people of the lowest class are prohibited from leaving the country on their own will. But if Mr. Shizu buys me, I will become his property and will be able to leave this place!""
""......""
Master Shizu continued his meal without saying a word.
""Please, I beg you! Please, buy me!""
""It's a good deal! I will work hard!""
""I can cook! And wash clothes! And sew!""
""And also, though it's embarrassing, since I'm a woman..., if Mr. Shizu wishes, you can lay your head in my lap and I can sing a lullaby to put you to sleep.""
Master Shizu finished his meal, ignoring all of this.
He wiped his mouth and stood up. With a gesture, he showed Rafa not to follow him. Saying to a kitchen attendant that he needed to make a phone call, he borrowed the phone hanging on the wall, which seemed like it will break at any time.
I was thinking about starting my meal, but then stopped and looked at Rafa. She noticed me and squatted down.
""Hey, what can I do to persuade this man?""
I told her that I had no idea. If there was a way, then I wouldn't have a hard time either.
When Master Shizu came back, Rafa stood up. She pointed the palm of her hand at me:
""Hey, look! I was talking to this dog right now, and he approved my proposal with a smile. So?""
Saying ""So?"" put him in a bind.
""It's his natural face... and he wouldn't approve of this either. At least not now.""
""I don't care! Take me with you! Buy me!""
The people around us were averting their eyes from the screaming Rafa and kept silent. Were they approving her actions, or just didn't want to interfere?
Master Shizu looked at me.
""Enough eating. Plus the repair——""
He glanced at Rafa. And then with an expression of something like ""I can't think of anything else"" and ""I might regret if I say this in front of her"" he said:
""——seems like it would take two more days.""


""So! Buy me! Take me with you! Take me with you!""
Rafa climbed the stairs, chasing Master Shizu. She followed us till our room. A loud voice was echoing in the corridor.
In the end, I didn't have a chance to eat, so I came back with a bread in my mouth.
""Riku.""
""Yes, Master Shizu.""
""Hey, so your name is Riku. Nice to meet you—— Mr. Shizu, please!""
""I'll leave the rest up to you.""
""What?""
The moment I said that, he shut the door and locked it with a key from the inside.
""Wa—!""
Rafa's voice was heard from behind:
""Hey, dog. Uhm, Riku. What should I do to please him?""
Well.
""Don't smile, answer me!""
""I am not smiling.""
Then she said, ""I have a work to do. I'm sorry, but I have to go.""
Before she left, she declared: ""When I have free time, I'll come back and ask him to buy me once again.""
Master Shizu let me into the room. After I conveyed Rafa's words, he said:
""Well, it doesn't concern me.""


Master Shizu spent the rest of the day in the room.
He was sitting on a chair, staring at some point in the cold room. From time to time he would pull out his katana and look at it. He didn't do anything else. He also refused to have lunch.
I also didn't say a word. I was either sitting or lying by his side, looking at the moving shadow of the window produced by the sun.
In the evening, the room became colored in orange by the setting sun.
""It would've been better if we managed to get to that country...""
Master Shizu opened his mouth for the first time in half a day and said this in a groan.
""I'm sorry, but I believe it's a good thing that we got full car service in this country. What if our buggy broke down shortly?""
Master Shizu laughed the moment I said that. But it was not a joyful laughter, but a fierce one.
""It's simple. We would've attacked guys who come to us and would've taken their car. They probably wouldn't have any objection.""
""Master Shizu——""
He interrupted me and said in a calm tone: ""There's nothing to argue about.""


""Good evening! Mr. Shizu, have you decided to buy me?""
Rafa came again during the supper. It was dark outside. In her basket, there was a little amount of scrap metal that she gathered during the day.
""Not yet,"" Master Shizu said shortly, without looking in her direction.
""Huh? What about tomorrow, will you buy me then?""
""Who knows.""
""Well, it's alright! Whether it's tomorrow or the day after tomorrow — I am always up for sale!""
""Is that so?""
""I don't mind when it is that you buy me!""
""I see.""
""But it's already late today, so I’ll come back tomorrow!""
""See you then.""
""Goodbye! Goodbye, Riku!""


The next day. The third day in the country.
Rafa didn't come during breakfast so Master Shizu leisurely took a meal. He contacted the repair shop and was told that the parts will come by noon, so the buggy will be ready by tomorrow morning.
""Therefore, we'll depart tomorrow morning.""
I asked what we'll do until then.
""I don't have anything in mind now.""
We returned to the room, and he just sat there and rested like yesterday. I don't know whether he was really doing nothing at all or was thinking about something.
Pretty soon the sky became covered with clouds, and it looked like it can start snowing any moment. Master Shizu continued to just sit there, without turning the lights on, like a retired old man in a villa.
He would've probably stayed in this position all day long, but for the girl who came at noon.


""Good afternoon! Good afternoon!""
Rafa knocked at the door with tremendous force and then opened it without waiting for reply.
She entered the room. Today she wasn't carrying that huge unbecoming basket.
Without need to ask, she explained: ""I've got a permission to be absent starting from the afternoon!""
Master Shizu, still sitting, glanced at Rafa, but then just kept on ignoring her.
""So I can stay in the room from now on! Mr. Shizu, please buy me! Today! I beg you! And then take me with you when you leave the country, please!""
Though she was selling herself for quite a long time, Master Shizu kept sitting on his chair, staying calm and thinking of something else, as if he knew some technique to suppress unwanted noise from the outside.
And then there was Rafa — she was talking nonstop, and I was wondering where her stamina was coming from. I looked at both of them with shock, that soon changed to admiration.


Nearly one hour has passed. Master Shizu suddenly looked at Rafa.
The girl kept talking on and on:
""Since I was born poor, I wasn't able to attend school and didn't receive a proper job, so we are getting poorer and poorer.""
When she said that, Master Shizu finally opened his mouth:
""... I want to ask you something.""
""Alright! What is it?""
""Do you have a family?""
As Rafa heard the question, her tone became colder:
""Yes...,"" she answered briefly.
""What are they doing now?""
""My father doesn't have a job, so he does nothing in particular. My mother is doing the chores all day. My brothers and sisters are still very young. I'm the oldest among seven siblings.""
""So you are the only one who is working?""
""Yes...""
Master Shizu raised himself from the back of the chair. Rafa, standing beside him, backed off a little.
""Answer me honestly. If you disappear, then there will be no more source of income. What will these people do?"" Master Shizu looked at Rafa and asked in very kind tone.
Silence fell for some time.
Then Rafa answered with a tense expression:
""I don't know. It would be good if they manage to find a job and then work all day, without attending school, to feed the family. Just like I'm doing right now.""
""I see. In other words, you prefer to live by yourself?"" Master Shizu made a sarcastic remark.
Rafa looked at him. No, she returned a sharp look. And then made a small fierce nod.
""Yes—— I would've preferred to live by myself. A human should live his life by himself. I want to live my life the way I want it. That's why I’m here asking you to buy me. Besides, it might be the one and only chance I can have. That's why, that's why... I beg you to buy me...""
She closed her eyes and joined her hands on her chest, as if in prayer.
""What a horrible person,"" said Master Shizu. A gentle smile played on his face. I wonder, if he was really referring to another person?
He asked, ""How much?""
""Eh?"" Rafa opened her eyes in surprise.
""I asked how much should I pay to buy you.""


It took some time for the extremely agitated Rafa to calm down. I didn't know if the sum of money offered to her was low or high or if it was an appropriate one.
Without much thinking, Master Shizu simply said, ""Alright then.""
If he paid this money at the nearest town hall, then, legally speaking, she would become his property.
When she asked for the departure date, Master Shizu informed her that it will be tomorrow at noon. In the morning we will get back the buggy and buy the things we need—— including Rafa.
Rafa said that she understood and promised that she will join us at the city gates tomorrow at noon.
""Please stay true to your word! Whatever it takes! If you won't, then I... I...!"" Rafa snarled.
""I got it. I keep my promises. But please, don't take too much luggage.""
""Don't worry! I won't take a thing with me!""


Late night.
In the room with a small lamp, Master Shizu continued to polish his katana. I was watching it.
When he finished, I told him:
""It's a good thing, for the number of traveling companions to grow, right?""
Master Shizu looked at me.
""Riku—— We will abandon that child the moment we get out of the country. Then she can do whatever she wants.""
""But it means she will die soon—— She's not a dog.""
""Well, then let's leave her somewhere in the next country. She could help with the chores or whatever and be able to live. She would only change the place where she lives. She can have a good life depending on her efforts and luck.""
""But, the next country...,"" I put it mildly, and Master Shizu opened his eyes wide.
""... I forgot.""
He was really surprised. Being appalled at himself, he said:
""What the hell am I saying... I...""
He shook his head. Though realizing that it's useless, I proposed:
""Master Shizu. What if we postpone our plans in order to drop the girl at some place——""
""I won't do that. In that case... of course, I'll just leave her to you.""
""That's——""
""Good night.""
Master Shizu turned off the lights.


The next morning.
The sky was overcast. Master Shizu and I went to the repair shop. We received back our buggy as well as its worn-out parts.
Then we headed to the south district, which looked like another world, to get fuel, food and water supplies. Without saying a word, Master Shizu bought much more than usual.
Rafa was at the appointed place, but she wasn't alone. It was probably her family — young mother and father, and six little children.
She waved her hand joyfully as soon as she noticed us. Her parents and younger brothers and sisters didn't say anything, they just shed tears. They didn't say any words of favor or hate, they just kept crying while watching at us.
""Well, let's go.""
Saying that, Rafa got on the passenger seat I was sitting on. She was wearing several layers of purple clothes and didn’t have any luggage. She literally came without a thing. I resigned my seat to her and moved to the place over the luggage.
""Is everything alright?""
Asked Master Shizu, and Rafa answered:
""Yeah, let's go. First, to the town hall.""
He turned on the engine and we departed, leaving the crying family behind.


At the gate, we went through departure formalities. The guard looked at Rafa in surprise:
""Mister traveler? ... What is th-this filthy girl from the lower classes doing here?""
""I've bought her for some reason. Don't ask any further.""
After Master Shizu said that, Rafa produced the receipt.
""That's right. I'm Mr. Shizu's property. Is there any problem with the departure?""
""No...,"" the guard shook his head.
A little bit earlier we went to the town hall to ""complete the purchase"". An employee was quite amazed when he saw a huge pile of money in front of him, but he fell silent when Rafa said:
""My home address is written here. Tell my family that I’ve been sold. By all means!""
The gates started to open slowly.


When they finally opened, a completely white horizon appeared.
""Wow...,"" Rafa exclaimed.
She stood up from the passenger seat and froze.
The snow plain was stretching outside of the country. The end of winter was approaching. The layer of snow was getting thinner and soon the grass will grow from the ground and the whole land will be turned green.
Master Shizu ran the buggy outside of the gate. While he skillfully attached the chain to the wheels, Rafa kept staring at the white earth under the dark gray sky. The gate closed behind our backs.
""Don't you feel cold?"" asked Master Shizu, who was wearing his parka. Rafa answered that she's already used to it, and then:
""Let's go faster! To the middle of the snowfield where the country walls can't be seen. Come on!""
""Alright.""
Master Shizu raced the engine. It was running smoothly, without any black smoke.
The buggy started moving.


It happened pretty soon.
We haven't been running long. In fact, it was the time when both the shadow and the shapes of the country the girl was born in, vanished from our view.
""Stop,"" said Rafa.
""Huh?""
Master Shizu looked to the right, and she looked to the left.
""Please, stop the car.""
He hit the brakes. We were in the middle of the snowfield. Around us was a plain horizon.
""What's wrong?""
Rafa didn't answer that question, and just stepped out of the buggy.
With a mild expression on her face, she started walking, leaving footprints on the snow.
She stopped. In the middle of the snowfield. If you were a bird in the sky, you'd see a buggy and a girl standing still at a short distance from it.
""How long are you going to stay here? Let's go.""
Master Shizu spoke to her, pulling down his goggles. There was no irritation in his voice.
Rafa turned around quickly and let her braids down.
She said with a smile, ""I'm going to stay here.""
Master Shizu answered back with a dubious look:
""I don't understand what you mean.""
""Because I'll die soon,"" said Rafa.
He stopped the engine and the sound faded away in the windless snowfield.
""Because I'll die soon,"" Rafa said once again.


Master Shizu got off the buggy. She waited until he came closer, then spoke to him. I heard their talk from the buggy.
""In the morning I went to the hospital and sold my internal organs. Now I have some strange machinery inside that is working as a substitute. I was told that this machine and the painkillers will last for half a day only.""
""Why did you do that?""
""I wanted the money. The money I got, and the money Mr. Shizu paid at the town hall ——you've payed much much more than the market price—– were sent to my family.""
""And then what?""
""It's an enormous sum of money. My family will be able to subsist on it for several years. My younger brothers and sisters will be able to go to school. There will be no need for them to work like I did. After graduating from school, they'll be able to get a proper job. They will survive.""
""......""
""And as for me, I was able to see the scenery outside of our country. I wanted to see it for a long time.""
Rafa turned towards the distant horizon. Master Shizu, standing beside her, looked at the same direction. I watched them both standing side by side – tall Master Shizu and Rafa no taller than his chest.
""In other words——,"" he said, ""I was tricked and I wasted my money.""
""Yes, I'm sorry,"" Rafa answered, staring at the same scenery right in front of her.
""And you think you did nothing wrong?""
""Yeah, not a bit.""
Master Shizu gave something like a bitter smile or a small laughter.
""Because——""
""'Because'?""
""Mr. Shizu will also die rather soon, right?""
The two continued their talk, standing side by side on the snowfield.
I was watching their backs from the top of the car hood.
""Mr. Shizu said this back then. I've heard it.""
""Back then? Oh, that evening when I was talking to Riku in my room. I probably said that.""
I also heard that.
""Back then you said: 'I have to do it at the cost of my own life.' When I heard this, it was the first time I've realized this method. It became clear to me that it was the only method I had left—— so I thought: 'I'll also do this way.' That's why I decided to 'fool that person'...""
""I understand...""
""I had to do this. It was the first and last opportunity that Mr. Shizu gave to me. It was the only method I could use to carve my own destiny.""
Then she looked up at Master Shizu and said with a smile:
""It turned out well.""


""'All is well that ends well,' huh?"" said Master Shizu.
""What did you just say?""
""It's a proverb in the country where I was born in. If the outcome of the situation is good, then everything went well. The last thing that a person managed to accomplish in his life defines his existence—— Well, there's a different nuance, but the meaning is probably something like that.""
""Even now I think it would be wonderful if Mr. Shizu wouldn't die and traveled for a long, long time. But it seems that you will perish in the next country in order to fulfill your wishes. That's why it's impossible—— You have no choice.""
""Yeah, it's impossible.""
""In that case it might be better to part our ways here.""
""Yeah, probably.""


""I have one last request.... My stomach has being hurting me for a while now. I hate pain. So, Mr. Shizu, would you mind——""
""Ah..., I understand,"" Master Shizu said, and Rafa nodded lightly with an air of satisfaction.
Then she looked at the snowfield.
There was a completely white dreary scenery.
""You know, Mr. Shizu, the world outside is quite beautiful.""
""Yeah—— You can say that.""
""I think, there are more beautiful, picturesque places than this, right?""
""Well, I don't know.""
Rafa nodded.
""I don't know either.""


Rafa turned to Master Shizu and he turned to her.
She suddenly reached for his cheeks with both her hands.
""I will pray that Mr. Shizu will successfully carry out whatever he ought to do.""
""Yeah—— I will definitely accomplish this. I don't waver from my actions, so there's no reason to seek God's help, I guess,"" said Master Shizu.
""Squat down,"" said Rafa.
He bent his knees. She closed her eyes and kissed him lightly in the forehead.
""For luck,"" said Rafa with a slightly embarrassed look.
And then she pronounced the last words in her life:
""I'll wait.""
""Alright,"" he nodded.


Master Shizu had a vast knowledge of methods that can cause a horrible death.
He also knew how to do the opposite.


He laid her dead body on the snow, stood on his knees beside her and closed his eyes.
I got off the buggy and approached his side, walking firmly on the snow.
When he opened his eyes, he looked at me and then at Rafa, her eyes closed.
""What a kind smile. I want to die with the same smile on my face.""
Saying these words, a mild smile I've never seen before played about his face. It was exactly the same as Rafa's.


On the windless plain, the regular sound of a shovel digging the snow could be heard.
Soon it changed to the sound of filling up a hole.
Master Shizu returned to the buggy holding the shovel dirty with mud. I've never seen him crying. This time wasn't an exception.
He fixed the shovel at the back of the car and returned to the driver seat. He told me, standing on the snow:
""I've been overtaken. If she can do it, then I guess there's no reason for me not to be able to. If that happens, she'll laugh at me. —— Well, let's go, Riku.""
He joyfully put on his goggles.
I said, ""I venture to ask it one more time. Have you made up your mind?""
""There's no time for it. If we go now, we'll get there just in time. The buggy is also in good condition.""
He turned on the engine.
I looked at him. Sitting on the driver seat, he faced the front and asked me:
""What should we do? Should we also part our ways here?""
""No. I'll stay with you till the end.""
""I see. Let's go then.""
I jumped onto the car hood and then to my usual passenger seat. I looked forward, as I always did.
Master Shizu laid his hand on my head and patted gently.


The buggy ran across the snowfield, its engine echoing smoothly.
The buggy was heading north pushing through the thick snow with its front wheels and squeezing back the ground with the chains attached to its rear wheels.
To Master Shizu's homeland. We were running towards the land of killing.
