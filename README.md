# Riveter ðŸ’ª

<br>

The Riveter ðŸ’ª package measures social dynamics between personas mentioned in a collection of texts.

The package identifies and extracts the subjects, verbs, and direct objects in texts; it performs coreference resolution on the personas mentioned in the texts (e.g., clustering "Elizabeth Bennet", "Lizzy," and "she" together as one persona); and it measures social dynamics between the personas by referencing a given lexicon. The package currently includes Maarten Sap et al's lexicon for power and agency and Rashkin et al's lexicon for perspective, effect, value, and mental state. 

The name Riveter is inspired by ["Rosie the Riveter,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:We_Can_Do_It!.jpg) the allegorical figure who came to represent American women working in factories and at other industrial jobs during World War II. Rosie the Riveter has become an iconic symbol of power and shifting gender roles â€” subjects that the Riveter package aims to help users measure and explore.

## Installation

Requirements 
- Python 3.8
- numpy
- pandas
- spaCy 2.3.9
- neuralcoref
- seaborn
- matplotlib

### Example installation instructions

We recommend creating a new virtual environment. Activate this environment before installing and before running the code.

```
conda create -n riveterEnv python=3.8
conda activate riveterEnv
```

Download this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/maartensap/riveter-nlp.git
cd riveter-nlp
```

*Note: If installing on a Mac, you will need Xcode installed to run git from the command line.*

Install `neuralcoref` from source. This will also install spaCy 2.3.9.
```
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref.git
cd neuralcoref
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

Install pandas and download spaCy files.
```
conda install pandas
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage

### riveter.py

To run `riveter.py`, see the examples in `demo.ipynb` (both located in the `riveter` directory).

```
riveter = Riveter()  
riveter.load_sap_lexicon('power')
riveter.train(texts,
             text_ids)
persona_score_dict = riveter.get_score_totals()  
```

*Note: [Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/get-your-conda-environment-to-show-in-jupyter-notebooks-the-easy-way-17010b76e874) are some instructions for how to run `demo.ipynb` from the riveterEnv.*

### main.py (DEPRECATED)
To extract connotation frames from the command line, run main.py.

Command to run main.py: `python3 main.py --input_file fakeStories.csv`

Replace `fakeStories.csv` with any .csv input file, formatted as follows:

| text_id | text |
| ------- | ---- |
| 1			| This is a sample line of text. |
| 2 		| This is another line of text. It can be more than one sentence. |

*Note that each text_id should be unique, but can have any value.*
